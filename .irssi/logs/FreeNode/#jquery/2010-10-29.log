00:00  [KS]: yah
00:00  ravenzz: i'd like to do something like
00:00  ravenzz: if (s('querystring','4')) { doStuffs }
00:00  Hoe``: jquery doesn't have anything built in for working with select/options, does it?
00:00  Hoe``: like mySelect.addOption()
00:00  [KS]: ravenzz: you do not do that inside of success and error
00:01  [KS]: you just set the variable inside those functions and return it after tje ajax call
00:01  [KS]: ( assuming your ajax is sync )
00:01  capitan: if i want to update something on a client browser via ajax whenever there are updates needed (which i know how to catch on the server)... is polling my only way? i could have sworn there was some standard that "solved" this problem... no?
00:01  Vorspire: Hoe``; mySelect.append('<option/>');
00:01  Lumpio-: ravenzz, synchronous stuff that blocks in JavaScript = big no-no
00:01  Lumpio-: Learn about event-driven programming.
00:01  Hoe``: that's what I've been doing vorspire, I'll just write some of my own :)
00:01  ravenzz: Lumpio- eh
00:01  Vorspire: ^^
00:02  Lumpio-: eh what
00:02  ravenzz: i know
00:02  ravenzz: it isnt a definitive solution
00:02  Hoe``: you can make name spaces inside of jquery, right? like $.fn.select = {}; $.fn.select.addOption = function()...
00:02  Vorspire: Lumpio- why would they add the async: false option if the use was not intended?
00:02  Lumpio-: Vorspire: Dunno. Maybe they're dumb?
00:03  Vorspire: Oh, so you think you're better than the jQuery team?
00:03  Lumpio-: But the thing is, synchronous requests tend to block things. And that's not a good thing in single-threaded stuff
00:03  ravenzz: i'm trying to find a way to write a generic search function
00:03  [KS]: Lumpio-: so does alert()
00:03  ravenzz: and use that one in different case
00:03  Vorspire: exactly [KS]
00:03  [KS]: and basically every other thing in js
00:03  Lumpio-: alert is modal anyways
00:04  Vorspire: Infact, blocking the call stackcan be beneficial when needing to instantiate the data and ensure it's there
00:04  Lumpio-: Yeah, and it's very useful for /freezing everything else/ as well
00:04  ravenzz: another thing is..
00:04  Vorspire: It won't freeze if it's a local request, which all ajax is anyway
00:04  Hoe``: by default, stuff is and SHOULD be synchronous. the problem with requests is that they're slow slow in comparison to something like myInt++; so you lose UI responsiveness, which is bad bad
00:04  [KS]: so, the thing is, I am not going to discuss anything with someone who calls jq team dumb ...
00:04  Lumpio-: buh?
00:05  Lumpio-: Oh dear
00:05  Lumpio-: I apologize for my blasphemous comments
00:05  Hoe``: vorspire: the client is making the request, it's not the server calling itself
00:05  Lumpio-: Please do not stone me to death in the town square
00:05  Lumpio-: I shalt not speak bad of the gods any longer
00:05  Vorspire: Hoe``; no shit, i wrote an entire webserver application ;)
00:05  Lumpio-: ...
00:05  Hoe``: I must of misunderstood what you said
00:06  [KS]: ravenz: another thing is what? :)
00:06  [KS]: ravenzz*
00:06  Vorspire: Lumpio- if you're going to be like that, then why are you even here?
00:06  ravenzz: i can set up a rewrite rule like RewriteRule search/(.+) http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?q=$1 [L,NC]
00:06  Lumpio-: Because I had a question to ask about a few days ago and forgot to /part?
00:06  ravenzz: and then pass http://mywebsite.com/search/blablaba to ajax()
00:06  ravenzz: =
00:06  Lumpio-: But since I'm here, I might as well stay here
00:07  ravenzz: :?
00:07  Lumpio-: And spread the good word
00:07  Vorspire: You obviously don't need anyone's help with your egotistical complex, so your only reason for being here that I can see, is to troll.
00:07  ravenzz: or is there a cross domain issue
00:07  [KS]: ravenzz: I'd say not, but that's someting that you would need to take over to guys at #httpd
00:07  Hoe``: Is there any difference between container.empty() and container.find("*").destroy() ?
00:07  Lumpio-: I'd imagine container.empty might be slightly more efficient
00:08  Lumpio-: .find("*").destroy probably tries to destroy every node, while container.empty would only remove the top level nodes
00:08  Hoe``: Does it still remove events and stuff from memory?
00:08  Lumpio-: But which one is *actually* more efficient, and whether it actually makes a difference, would depend on the browser DOM implementation, I guess
00:09  Hoe``: also it being a does-speed-matter which is per situation, but ultimately i'd take properly clearing memory over anything else
00:09  Hoe``: i doubt any type of pseudo garbage collector that JS has does not take jQuery events into account
00:09  Hoe``: which can be a pretty big concern on a 100% ajax app
00:10  Lumpio-: Hmm. Now you got me interested
00:10  Hoe``: as far as debugging js which is fed over ajax goes, i get lost fast
00:11  Hoe``: it's hard to tell what's still in memory
00:11  Lumpio-: empty() does seem to clear data as well
00:11  Hoe``: ah, so it does drop events?
00:11  Lumpio-: Yes, I checked the source code.
00:11  Hoe``: ah, cool :)
00:11  Hoe``: thanks for checking
00:12  Lumpio-: also
00:12  Lumpio-: You got me confused there ¬_¬
00:12  Lumpio-: You do mean .remote and not .destroy right?
00:12  Vorspire: well if it really matters, just add a dispose function to the object prototype and call that whenever you're done with the reference... have dispose truncate all data and unset all properties of the referenced object

00:19  Lumpio-: More importantly, /how/ would they do that? o_O
00:19  Lumpio-: How can they possibly know that I'm not using some memory anymore if I haven't freed it
00:19  Vorspire: LOL I don't think you guys understand what garbage collection actually is >>
00:19  Lumpio-: LOL I don't think you understand computers
00:19  Vorspire: hahahaha
00:19  Hoe``: clearly i don't haha
00:19  Vorspire: thanks for making me laugh!

00:19  Vorspire: have fun
00:20 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
00:20  Hoe``: real men malloc(4*1024*1024) and do their own memory management
00:20  Lumpio-: It's.... a forum profile.
00:20  Hoe``: of course don't forget to delete() that when your window is minimized
00:20  Lumpio-: What next, we're gonna start comparing Stack Overflow reputation?
00:20 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 108 seconds
00:21  Hoe``: (maybe he thinks process priorities are gc's?)
00:21  Vorspire: Lumpio- if you actually read, you'll notice that RunUO is a console application written in C#
00:21  Lumpio-: Yes. And the .NET runtime has a garbage collector.
00:21  Lumpio-: Hence it's possible that it frees memory at times
00:21  Hoe``: possibly even on events, like minimize, but lord knows
00:22  Vorspire: That accumulates memory usage up to 300k and more, when it's minimized and restored, that memory is freed
00:22  Lumpio-: Possibly when it's likely it doesn't disturb the user too much, for example, when the app is minimized
00:22  Vorspire: guess wy?
00:22  Lumpio-: However this has no relevance to something with no GC
00:22  Lumpio-: For instance, C
00:22  Vorspire: because of the internal console message queue buffer being reset
00:22  Vorspire: and that's standard in ANY console app
00:22  Lumpio-: Sorry, I'm not that much into the internals of Windows
00:22  Hoe``: alright vorspire, you win
00:23  Lumpio-: I admit
00:23  Lumpio-: You know more about the internal workings of the Windows terminal window whatever than I do
00:23  Lumpio-: There, take you victory
00:23  Lumpio-: I hope it's a bitter one
00:23  Lumpio-: +r
00:23  Vorspire: I'm not here for victory, I'm here to prove that idiots exist.
00:24  Lumpio-: Uh-huh
00:24  Lumpio-: At any rate, I still fail to see the relevance of the internal workings of the Windows console window thingy to... well, anything that we were talking about earlier.
00:25  Hoe``: Vorspire: your proof is very self evident
00:25  hugleo: hi
00:25  Vorspire: You were talking about freeing memory, i described one process with the dispose and prototype extension whcih would perform similarly to a manual garbage collection.
00:26  Lumpio-: I'm pretty sure that "manual garbage collection" is an oxymoron
00:26  hugleo: Are there a alternative to http://www.soyos.net/tl_files/demos/aero-window/ to load windowed iframe?
00:26  Lumpio-: At the very least, "garbage collection" commonly refers to "automatic" garbage collection.
00:26  Vorspire: no it doesn't
00:27  Vorspire: in c#, manaual disposing of objects is done all the time
00:27  peepz: im doing this in IE6 and it's pulling a cached version.. how can I get around this:  $.getJSON('inc/json.php?asset_id=' + asset_id, function(data) {...}
00:27  Lumpio-: Disposing is not garbage collection.
00:27  Vorspire: whether it be a using statement or a .Dispose() call to an IDisposable object
00:27  Lumpio-: Disposing frees non-managed resources associated with the object
00:27  dabear_: peepz: append a unique identifier to the url
00:27  Hoe``: "In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management." -- wikipedia
00:27  Lumpio-: But it doesn't destroy the object itself.
00:27  Hoe``: but that should be 'citation needed' i guess...
00:27  Lumpio-: Well, non-managed resources or resources that should be freed as quickly as possible
00:27  Lumpio-: Such as locks
00:28  Vorspire: Hell, I wrote my own garbage collector... we can continue arguing all day, but it's futile.
00:28  Lumpio-: But at any rate, it doesn't destroy the object. The object will still stay in memory as long as there are references to it
00:28  Lumpio-: And once those are gone as well, the GC will eventually collect it.
00:28  Vorspire: Yes, true
00:28  Vorspire: the underlying GC will
00:28  peepz: how do I randomlize one?
00:28  Vorspire: but for performance, it's better to manually initiate it
00:28  Hoe``: generally in C# you'll see the 'using' statement, which is a fantastic shorthand
00:29  Hoe``: errm, no it's not lol
00:29  [KS]: peepz: add new Date().getTime(); at the end of it
00:29  Lumpio-: Yeah, except that in by far the most cases the GC can figure out when to collect quite well by itself
00:29  Vorspire: Hoe``; http://webserverlite.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/39723#466997
00:29  peepz: $.getJSON('inc/json.php?asset_id=' + asset_id +'&uid'+Date().getTime(), function(data) { ..}
00:29  peepz: :)
00:29  Vorspire: near the bottom of the source you will notice a manual garbage collector
00:29  Lumpio-: Most times people call GC.Collect they're doing it wrong.
00:29  Hoe``: it's seldom a good idea to think you'll do better than the gc
00:30  [KS]: something like that
00:30  Lumpio-: Sure, if you know what you're doing, you can do it, but most of the time people do it wrong.'
00:31  Vorspire: Lupio- I won't disagree with that statement
00:31  hobs: ost of the time people do it wrong
00:31  Vorspire: argh I'm gonna throw this keyboard outta the window
00:31  hobs: most
00:31  hobs: I just did it wrong for instan
00:31  Lumpio-: Is the tab key broken...?
00:31  Vorspire: no, it's wireless.. instant fail ;)
00:32  Lumpio-: Vorspire, that's not garbage collection. That's freeing up unusused things manually.
00:32  Vorspire: Lumpio- It's a direct reference to GC :/
00:32  Vorspire: ahh screw this
00:32  Vorspire: I give up
00:32  Vorspire: that's 1:1 /draw
00:32  Lumpio-: ¬__¬
00:33  Lumpio-: Bottom line: if you do it manually, it's not garbage collection D:
00:33  peepz: [KS]: what am I doing wrong>
00:33  Lumpio-: GC doesn't mean that you don't need to *any* memory management, because you still have to tell it about things you don't need anymore by removing references to them
00:33  [KS]: peepz: you tell me :)
00:33  Vorspire: GC.GetTotalMemory(true); - force automatic GC
00:33  peepz: Math.random()
00:33  peepz: ill just use that?
00:33  Lumpio-: Yes, you are *telling* the garbage collector to collect
00:33  [KS]: okay, suit yourself :)
00:33  Lumpio-: But your code still isn't a garbage collector.
00:34  Lumpio-: Terminology, people, terminology!
00:34  snover: “[17:18:02] Vorspire: Console apps are wierd, they free memory when you miimize/restore :)” what the what
00:34  Hoe``: Lumpio-: In C#, what do you need to manually dispose of that's not an unmanaged object?
00:34  Vorspire: snover; idd
00:35  peepz: [KS]: i didnt get your code to work...something bad with using Math.rand??
00:35  snover: ?ud idd
00:35  bot-t: snover, idd - Indeed
00:35  Lumpio-: Hoe``: Well, some things should be disposed of as quickly as possible (such as things that block other things, e.g. locks)
00:35  Hoe``: ah, yes :)
00:35  Lumpio-: And some unexpected things will actually be references from other places
00:35  nail_: and corpses bitten by zombies
00:35  Lumpio-: For instance, IDataReaders from some SQL clients
00:35  Lumpio-: Forget to close one of those and the next query will break...
00:36  Lumpio-: whoa, that line just now made no sense
00:36  Lumpio-: Some things will have unexpected references to them from other places*
00:36  [KS]: peepz: not if you are certain that it is indeed random
00:36  [KS]: how often is getJson going to be executed?
00:36  peepz: at most once every 3 sec
00:36  Hoe``: lumpio: ya, I normally don't consider that to be a gc issue, just a rereference problem
00:36  [KS]: so that's 1200 executions per hour
00:37  Lumpio-: ...I thought we were talking about disposing
00:37  snover: You guys are pretending to talk about garbage collection but I feel like that isn’t the topic of this conversation
00:37  Hoe``: well, you're right :)
00:37  Hoe``: it's secretly a drug deal
00:37  Lumpio-: Don't tell anyone k
00:37  Vorspire: <///////////#=- ~~~~
00:38  Hoe``: stenography at it's finest
00:38  peepz: ur saying it might hit the random variable twice? :) cmon dude
00:38  [KS]: it's secretly a rage about who knows more about programming languages :)
00:38  peepz: the odds are very slim.
00:38  linelevel: Hi guys. I'm not sure if this is a Django issue or a jQuery issue. I'm submitting a request via the jQuery function $.ajax(). The Django view script for the requested URL starts by checking request.is_ajax(), which returns false. Any suggestions?
00:38  [KS]: peepz: I still prefer none to slim. unix timestamp has a chance of none :)
00:38 --- boaz_ is now known as boaz
00:39  Prometheus: linelevel: check the headers for the request
00:39  Vorspire: [KS] unless it's called in the same stack
00:39  Vorspire: then it will be the same
00:39  Prometheus: linelevel: which version of django and jquery?
00:39  [KS]: Vorspire: once every 3 seconds ?
00:39  Vorspire: ahh then that's obviously fine lol
00:40  Lumpio-: linelevel: Is the request using XHR?
00:40  Prometheus: linelevel: and which browser?
00:41 --- seutje is now known as frigginAsleep
00:41  Lumpio-: (I dunno Django properly) but I'd imagine something called "is_ajax" would just check for the X-Requested-With header
00:41  Lumpio-: And that would only work with actualy XHRs
00:41  Lumpio-: -y
00:42  Vorspire: [KS] I always use; Math.round(new Date().getTime() * Math.random() * 65536) for a true random number, but i guess it's still possible to hit the same number twice, like 0.0001% possible
00:43  Prometheus: ('HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH') == 'XMLHttpRequest'
00:43  Prometheus: it checks that
00:43  coldhead: Vorspire++
00:43  coldhead: that is truly random of you
00:43  [KS]: Vorspire: It's a matter of preference really
00:44  flupke: don't reinvent the wheel, use uuid
00:44  coldhead: i prefer a miler comedian
00:44  Lumpio-: How unique does this number you want need to be?
00:44  Lumpio-: Page-scope?
00:44  Lumpio-: Session scope?
00:44  [KS]: besides, I believe that jquery has nocache option for .ajax anyway :)
00:44  linelevel: Prometheus, jQuery 1.4.3, Django 1.2.3, tested on Firefox 3.6 and latest Chrome build.
00:44  Vorspire: Random UID's? that's exactly why I wrote this; http://acorn.vita-nex.com/JavaScript/serial_provider.vn.js
00:46  Prometheus: linelevel: let me see, I'll do a quick test
00:46  snover: what the christ
00:46  Lumpio-: ...what does that thing do
00:46  snover: Lumpio-: Best not to ask
00:47  [KS]: there's eval() :)
00:47  snover: [KS]: I was just going to congratulate him about that
00:47  Vorspire: Uhh simply, it generates a random serial or UID that can be attached to an element or jQuery object without having to modify the ID attribute of the element in question
00:47  Lumpio-: ...why does it have to be that complicated
00:47  snover: Lumpio-: it doesn’t
00:47  snover: at all
00:47  Vorspire: For what I use it for, it does.
00:47  snover: you bet.
00:48  Lumpio-: var nextUuid = 1; function generateUuid() { return nextUuid++; }
00:48  Lumpio-: Not unique enough?
00:48  snover: ^^
00:48  Lumpio-: Well, it's not exactly *U*UID but unique on the page
00:48  Prometheus: linelevel: that's very odd
00:48  snover: Lumpio-: Using random numbers doesn’t guarantee universal uniqueness either
00:48  Lumpio-: I know
00:48  Vorspire: what if you wanted to supply a seed or salt? what if you wanted to prefix it? what if you wanted to apply it to a jQuery object and retrieve it at a later date? you going to sit and code that for every element?
00:49  Prometheus: linelevel: it does work for me
00:49  Lumpio-: Why would I need a seed or a salt? If I want a prefix, I can just do "foo" + (nextUuid++).
00:49  linelevel: Prometheus, Lumpio-, Here is the code for my request: http://pastebin.com/XrMuHfQh
00:49  Lumpio-: Why would I have jQuery objects persist across dates
00:49  Vorspire: besides, my SerialProvider is recursive, therefore, if it finds that it does generate a serial that has already be generated, it wll generate a new one until it really is unique
00:49  Vorspire: THATS why it's so omplicated
00:49  snover: or
00:49  Prometheus: linelevel: and your django code?
00:49  snover: you could use an iterator
00:50  snover: like Lumpio- demonstrates
00:50  snover: er, s/iterator/counter
00:50  Lumpio-: Or you could just use a sequential number ¯\(º_o)/¯
00:50  snover: Lumpio-: But that’s just not ENTERPRISE enough
00:50  Lumpio-: ah
00:50  Lumpio-: You're right.
00:50  snover: Lumpio-: For instance, what if time goes in reverse!?!
00:51  Lumpio-: However I must point out that enterprise always spells trouble, unless we're talking about Star Trek.
00:51  snover: Lumpio-: I’m pretty sure it means the same thing in Star Trek, only, the trouble is usually resolved after 40 minutes in a Star Trek episode
00:51  snover: Trouble like Vorspire’s code can live on for years and years
00:51  Vorspire: snover, i've yet to see any of your code...
00:51  Vorspire: in the months i've been here
00:52  snover: Vorspire: I’ve submitted patches to jQuery and jQuery UI, you can go read those if you want.
00:52  Vorspire: patches are patches, not full blown pkugins or apps
00:53  Lumpio-: I could submit a patch to your serial thing
00:53  Lumpio-: One that reduces it to less lines than the ginormous license thing at the top
00:53  Vorspire: you could
00:54  Vorspire: then do it
00:54  Vorspire: show me
00:54  linelevel: Prometheus, here is the code for a decorator-like function that I wrap around the view function associated with the post URL: http://pastebin.com/yTxZPZNR
00:54  Lumpio-: But I'm lé tired
00:54  Vorspire: keep the same functionality of it and show me that you can
00:54 --- mikeric_ is now known as mikeric
00:54  Vorspire: yea i thought so
00:54  Vorspire: full of shit :)
00:54  Lumpio-: Of course I would remove the functionality that's not useful for anything.
00:54  Vorspire: uh-huh :)
00:54  Vorspire: just because your brain can't figure out a use for it, doesn't mean there isn't one
00:55  Prometheus: linelevel: have you tried it without the decorator?
00:55  linelevel: Prometheus, As you can see, it gets passed the request object associated with the ajax request, and the first thing it does is check request.is_ajax(), which always branches to the 'else' clause.
00:55  Prometheus: just to see if it works that way
00:55  Lumpio-: Vorspire: You've yet to mention one either.
00:56  linelevel: Prometheus, Yeah, let me set up a one-line view just to test it.
00:56  Lumpio-: I can think of many /bad/ uses, of course, but not of a single one that makes sense.
00:56  Prometheus: linelevel: out of the box request.is_ajax works just fine for me
00:56  Vorspire: Lumpio- btw, I've only worked with JavasScript as long as I have with jQuery and it's not my first language and that SerialProvider was one of the very first things I ever wrote for jQuery, at that point I didn't know about other UUID method etc
00:56  Prometheus: using the latest jquery and django
00:56  snover: Vorspire: And yet, here you are, still defending it like it’s the best thing ever
00:56  Lumpio-: Vorspire: You didn't know about the "++" operator? Whoa.
00:56  Prometheus: so I don't think the problem lies with either
00:56  Vorspire: ahh you guys are retarded trolls :P
00:57  Vorspire: seriously
00:57  Lumpio-: At least we're also trolls
00:57  Vorspire: had more fight from a door-stop
00:57  snover: Lumpio-: I tried not to laugh, but then…I did
00:57  Lumpio-: http://lumpio.dy.fi/b/tf.jpg
00:58  Prometheus: linelevel: I was under the impression you should pass the request object to your inner function
00:58  Prometheus: as an argument
00:58  Vorspire: so snover, what have you achieved beyond jQuery?
00:58  Prometheus: i.e. the wrap function
00:58  Prometheus: err, wrapped*
00:58 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
00:58  [KS]: how long is this going to last?
00:58  Vorspire: as long as it has to
00:58  Lumpio-: As long as it TAKES
00:58  snover: Vorspire: Stop trying to create a straw man, Vorspire.
00:59  Vorspire: snover; that's a "nothing" then?
00:59  Vorspire: fair enough
00:59  Lumpio-: Ohhhh man
00:59  Lumpio-: I hadn't heard that one since middle school
00:59  Lumpio-: Takes me way back
00:59  snover: It’s a you trying to engage in fallacies of relevance, and me refusing to play that game

01:03  Vorspire: well it didn't take long to prove a point, so I guess that's 2:1 to me :)
01:03  linelevel: Prometheus, but the test i'm doing right now will cut that part out
01:03  Lumpio-: I'm not quite sure what point you have proven here
01:03  Prometheus: linelevel: I think your decorator is set up backwards
01:03  Prometheus: which is the reason why it's wrong
01:03  Prometheus: err, false

01:05  Hoe``: sick burn
01:06  Prometheus: linelevel: I suggest reading through http://charlesleifer.com/blog/django-patterns-view-decorators/
01:06  Prometheus: that's a pretty good primer on the subject =)
01:07  linelevel: Prometheus, It's not that. I understand the decorator concept. What's happening in my code is that I apply a real decorator to the view function, which calls the pseudo-decorator I showed you on 2 different functions which are used by that view function, passing them the request object. But you might still be right that I screwed it up. Hold on one sec and I'll let you know.
01:08  Prometheus: linelevel: have you printed your request within the inner function?
01:08  Prometheus: just to see if it's actually there

01:25  Frantic: guys, is there any html5 effect to tint an image? I have a shape that I want to tint in different colors, but can't seem to find anything for that
01:26  Frantic: or at least I can't find the name
01:26  snover: Frantic: Go read about <canvas>
01:26  Vorspire: tinting can be achieved by using a 4x4 pixel image, where 2 pixels are transparent and 2 are the color you want, in a binary fashion, can be applied as an overlay to give the tint
01:27  Vorspire: or canvas >>
01:27  Vorspire: <<
01:28  Vorspire: 2x2 *
01:28  Vorspire: ./sigh
01:28  Lumpio-: ...or an alpha-transparent image
01:28  Frantic: snover: arf I was trying to avoid canvas :)
01:28  Lumpio-: There's still the problem of making the tint the correct shape, if his shape isn't square
01:28  snover: arf?
01:28  Lumpio-: <canvas> is nice.
01:29  Frantic: Vorspire: I'd like to read more on that, but what is it called? :)
01:29  snover: Frantic: Don’t.
01:29  snover: Frantic: It will not do what want.
01:29  snover: what you want*
01:29  Lumpio-: An alpha-transparent image will give better results in pretty much every case
01:29  snover: An alpha-transparent image won’t provide “tint”
01:29  Lumpio-: It won't
01:29  snover: You can’t use normal blending and end up with a tinted image
01:30  Lumpio-: Well, actually
01:30  Vorspire: Are you two joined at the hip or something? xD
01:30  Lumpio-: It depends on the definition of "tint" ¬__¬
01:30  Lumpio-: There's probably some kind of color theory definition, and then there's the layman's definition
01:30  Frantic: Lumpio-: by alpha-transparent image you mean create a transparent image to use as a mask for a background-color?
01:31  Lumpio-: Add a red partially transparent image -> "it looks kind of reddish" -> red tint
01:31  Lumpio-: Frantic: No I mean you'd use the image itself for the color. But it'll involve creating the image
01:31  Vorspire: it's 4 pixels ffs
01:31  Frantic: snover: By tint I didn't mean really tint as in light effect, just to change the color of a white image to any other rgb value
01:32  Frantic: let me try this again :)
01:32  snover: Frantic: yes please.
01:32  Lumpio-: Vorspire: Without <canvas> he'll need to generate that image on the server side ¬__¬
01:32  Xenc: is doing sometihng like leg = legs[i]; then doing leg.name, leg.route at the start of a for loop faster than constantly referencing legs[i].name, legs[i].route
01:32  Lumpio-: And if he's going to do that, he might as well do the whole tint thing on the server side.
01:32  snover: Xenc: yes

01:33  Frantic: I have a few pages that display some shapes on the margin, and I want each page to have a different color for the shapes. Rather than create 20ish images of the exact shape with different color, I was looking for a way to change the color of a single-color image
01:33  Lumpio-: Here's a crazy idea: generate the image in red, green and blue and then combine those with opacity
01:33  Frantic: is this in any way possible? :)
01:33  Xenc: Haha, ok snover
01:33  Xenc: thanks :)
01:34  snover: Lumpio-: It doesn’t work that way :|
01:34  Lumpio-: ...it does for a whole lot of colors!
01:34  Lumpio-: Not all of them, but hey
01:34  Lumpio-: If we had additive blending it would work perfectly :I
01:34  Frantic: Lumpio-: that would be more complicated than creating the iamges :)
01:34  Frantic: Lumpio-: because I'd have to keep trying different alpha values till I get the one I want
01:34  snover: Frantic: Why don’t you want to use <canvas>?
01:34  Lumpio-: Frantic: If you're looking for simplicity... it's either <canvas> or generating the images.
01:34  Lumpio-: Frantic: Or you could just use, you know, maths.
01:34  Lumpio-: There are limitations though
01:35  Vorspire: Well i you know how to do bitwise shiftin,g you can colorate the individual pixels with the tint you want, provided you supply an RGB value to translout from... Does JavaScript have that capability, because if it does, I smell a new plugin. - Based on the PHP GD theory
01:35  Frantic: snover: yep, guess I'll look into canvas, thanks :)
01:35  Lumpio-: Vorspire: Yeah, it's called <canvas>
01:35  Vorspire: Never used canvas before, so guess I'll look into that

01:37  addyosmani: ahaha.
01:37  Lumpio-: Anyways, canvas is basically a bitmap you can draw to.
01:37  Vorspire: You forget that JavaScript is like... my 10th language
01:37  Lumpio-: It has shape drawing, transforms, and even direct pixel access
01:37  l4rk: javascript is my first and only language
01:37  l4rk: why did you bother learning anything else
01:37  erichynds: l4rk++
01:37  Vorspire: Well then there you go, stfu l4rk
01:37  Lumpio-: >implying that 10 languages is something extraordinary

01:38  addyosmani: this is progress for l4rk

01:41  Lumpio-: docs?

01:45  snover: Lumpio-: I know it is hard to come to terms with the evolution of a technology term. :)
01:45  Vorspire: It's usually helpful to name a function after what it's intended function is...
01:45  danheberden: or is it "tony danza"

01:45  Vorspire: AJAX request function is $.ajax for a reason, not $.getMyWebPageFromHERE
01:46  snover: well that’s unexpected.
01:46  snover: Vorspire: I am pretty sure Lumpio-’s point is that most of the time, it is not actually XML.
01:46  Lumpio-: The word "ajax" is non-descriptive, unintuitive and frequently misused.
01:46  danheberden: $.doneNowGetItYouWill = $.ajax;
01:46  Lumpio-: That's the non-descriptive part
01:46  Vorspire: FAIR ENOUGH! :)
01:47  Lumpio-: And I can't even count the times [marketing] people [or other drones] call things that are not "ajax", "ajax".
01:47  danheberden: lol
01:47  Lumpio-: "whoa, look at this drag and drop thing, it's so ajax it's web 2.0" "..."
01:47  erichynds: anything mysterious is ajax
01:47  danheberden: "ooh, a window popped up!! cool ajax!!"   "uh.. that's an alert dialog"
01:47  snover: Lumpio-: Well that sounds like a problem with your marketing department. And as far as the drones go, you need to pick a better company to service your drones, clearly.
01:47  Lumpio-: Oh, it's not our marketing department.
01:48  oneforall: sounds like all marketing. claiming things are something they are not.
01:48  Lumpio-: But anyways, the main thing that bothers me is
01:48  danheberden: how existential
01:48  Lumpio-: Making server requests are now just everyday life in JS
01:48  danheberden: she won't hold you close afterwards?
01:48  Lumpio-: Why do we need a special name for the "technology"!?
01:48  danheberden: special?
01:48  Lumpio-: That's like calling addition "pluserizing" or... DOM manipulation "Dynamic HTML" (or "DHTML" for short)
01:48  Lumpio-: *aw snap* the latter actually exists
01:49  danheberden: Lumpio-: so should they get rid of the term JSON too?
01:49  Lumpio-: No
01:49  Lumpio-: I used to hate that one as well but now I see the point
01:49  bobbobbins: i just reinitialized it in the load() function and it worked fine
01:49  danheberden: lawl
01:49  Lumpio-: JSON is something that's frequently used in non-JS contexts as well, and it needs a word for it.
01:49  Lumpio-: And JSON isn't bad, it's pretty descriptive.
01:49  Lumpio-: (The word, that is)
01:50  Lumpio-: "AJAX", on the other hand, is not.
01:50  oneforall: lol listening to you all I was confused enough thanks :)
01:50  snover: Lumpio-: We need a name for the technology because otherwise people would have to say “you know, the mechanism whereby you make a call to a server via JavaScript using an XMLHttpRequest object, or sometimes not using XMLHttpRequest but instead injecting a script tag, but either way it makes a call to the server without reloading the entire page and then returns some data and you can then pick up and use the data”
01:50  snover: which is a little verbose.
01:50  Lumpio-: snover: How about just calling it a "HTTP request"
01:50  Lumpio-: Or a "web request"
01:50  Lumpio-: Or just a damn request :V
01:50  snover: Lumpio-: Because a regular page reload is an HTTP request too
01:50  danheberden: snover - hahahaha
01:51  Lumpio-: Well, regular addition on paper is addition as well but we still call addition in JavaScript "addition2
01:51  Lumpio-: "

01:58  compi: [{data:d,tickDecimals:2}]
01:58  snover: compi: you should probably read the documentation because you can’t put that there.
01:58  snover: tickDecimals is an axis property
01:59  compi: i've read the API a bunch of times but can't find a way to output decimals in the data
02:00  compi: snover - yea. but i cant find a property to output decimals on the graph for the data itself. i'm supplying it decimals but it automatically rounds it off
02:00  snover: compi: I don’t know what you are talking about, “in the data”
02:01  compi: yea, in [d]
02:01  snover: compi: you know what an axis label is, right?

02:03  peepz: how do I automatically open next select box upon closing the preceding one?
02:04  danheberden: you dont
02:04  snover: compi: flot doesn’t coerce your data into integral values unless you tell it to. You are trying to use options that don’t exist where you are trying to use them to get flot to do something it’s not doing.
02:04  peepz: :o
02:04  danheberden: you can't 'open' it
02:04  peepz: there is no way of auto opening a select box?
02:04  snover: compi: If you want help, please provide a link to a working test case.
02:05  aaroninfidel: bot-t: your a CIA agent aren't you?
02:05  bot-t: aaroninfidel, Yes.
02:05  compi: its not that complicated. im passing data as decimals and flot is converting to whole numbers
02:05  ralf_e: hi
02:05  ralf_e: I got a little "is this the best way" question.
02:05  ralf_e: i want to chain animations on different elements one after each other.
02:05  ralf_e: is 'intertwining' the queues of the elements the best way to do this?
02:05  ralf_e: like in $('#el1').queue(function(next) { $('#el2').animate({padding: '10'}, next); });
02:06  snover: compi: prove it.
02:06  Vorspire: peepz; you mean with multiple selection select boxes? For example on most websites that provide a selection tree for downloading drivers based on OS, version, etc?
02:06  peepz: no
02:06  Vorspire: Please clarify :)
02:06  peepz: think of the select tag
02:07  compi: i already did, but here it is again
02:07  peepz: drop down..
02:07  compi: var d = [[1254351600000,31.59],[1257030000000,32.72],[1259625600000,33.12]];
02:07  snover: <snover> compi: If you want help, please provide a link to a working test case.
02:07  Vorspire: You want to activate the drop-down function without clicking the select element itself?
02:07  peepz: when the user opens the first select drop down and selects an element, I want the next select drop down to open automatically.
02:07  peepz: yes!
02:07  peepz: :::D:D:D:D
02:07  snover: compi: Pasting me a data set and some invalid flot JS doesn’t prove anything.
02:07  Vorspire: ^^
02:07  snover: peepz: Not possible.
02:08  Vorspire: peepz; i'm not sure it can be done
02:08  peepz: (U)
02:08  peepz: why is that not possible?
02:08  snover: peepz: why would it be?
02:08  Vorspire: It's handled internally by the browser, peepz, probebly why
02:08  peepz: becuase it eleminited a click interactin from the user
02:08  OhaiBBQ: lol wat
02:08  Lumpio-: Doubt that's doable
02:08  Lumpio-: Not with the standard <select> element
02:09  Vorspire: Would it not, in theory, be possible if you trigger the click event on it?
02:09  Lumpio-: You could make your lists just normal scrolly lists instead of selects
02:09  snover: And it shouldn’t be
02:09  joshsmith: how do you check if a value is not null?
02:09  Lumpio-: Vorspire: I suspect few browsers would support that
02:09  snover: JoshA: !== null
02:09  Vorspire: yea
02:09  Lumpio-: ...if any
02:09  Vorspire: "in theory" :)
02:10  danheberden: omg you guys are still talking about that?

02:16  OhaiBBQ: lol if you pass a jQuery object into jQuery it returns the set of dom elements

02:19  Lumpio-: ew
02:19  Lumpio-: Why would you want to imitate the window style of some random OS on a web page D:
02:20  Vorspire: Ahh the dektop-design theory, evidentially useless
02:20  Lumpio-: And that one doesn't even work properly!
02:20  Lumpio-: I made an online desktop thing once ¬__¬
02:20  Lumpio-: It was quite useless
02:20  Vorspire: I tried too, it was useless xD
02:20  Lumpio-: It even had a server-side filesystem and all
02:20  j0hng4lt: Does anyone know why jQuery doesn't have namespacing of any kind? Is there a theoretical reason for it? I find that there's no need for namespaces in the core, but plugins could benefit from them.
02:20  Vorspire: did it, then I foundno use for it
02:20  Lumpio-: Me neither
02:21  Lumpio-: Or well, I once used it to view multiple web pages in one window...
02:21  Lumpio-: It has an application called Useless Explorer which was essentially an iframe
02:21  Lumpio-: had*
02:21  Vorspire: rofl
02:21  j0hng4lt: I find $(this).dialog('close') a bit awkward
02:21  danheberden: j0hng4lt: namespacing should be a consideration outside of jquery
02:22  Lumpio-: You'd rather do $(this).dialog.close() ?
02:22  hugleo: I need only have a beautiful resized iframe
02:22  Lumpio-: I think it'd have to be $(this).dialog().close() at the very least, for it to work at all
02:22  Vorspire: isn't it: $(this).dialog({ close: true }); ?
02:22  Lumpio-: hugleo: The resizable thing in jQuery UI doesn't work?
02:23  danheberden: that kinda goes against the style of jq
02:23  Lumpio-: Vorspire: gah, that's even more verbose
02:23  Vorspire: i know lol
02:23  j0hng4lt: Lumpio-: I was thinking more of the latter
02:23  Lumpio-: dialog().close() ?
02:23  Lumpio-: OR
02:23  Lumpio-: Or?*
02:23  danheberden: but dialog should just return the collection again
02:24  j0hng4lt: Yes
02:24  danheberden: you're breaking the entire flow of jq if you go that way
02:24  Vorspire: ?end
02:24  coldhead: collection are awesome
02:24  hugleo: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
02:24  Vorspire: isn't .end() there to continue the flow?
02:24  hugleo: I did'nt found a Iframe example
02:25  danheberden: Vorspire: it just reverse to the previous stack
02:25  Lumpio-: hugleo: Did you try improvising?
02:25  danheberden: *Reverts
02:25  Lumpio-: hugleo: Protip: programming is so much more than just copy-pasting examples
02:25  Vorspire: Yea, the original selection
02:25  hugleo: Lumpio-, heh
02:26  Lumpio-: But yeah, dialog().close() would break teh flow.
02:26  j0hng4lt: You could technically implement this as a pattern. .dialog() would return an object whose end() method would return the orihinal jQuery object
02:26  danheberden: Lumpio-: what?! WHEN WAS THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MADE?!
02:26  Hopsy: does anyone know that site with great google chrome demo javascript things
02:26  danheberden: j0hng4lt: you're right, but you can see how that would add confusion
02:26  Lumpio-: johan_bouveng: That's cumbersome.
02:26  j0hng4lt: Thereby allowing you to continue the chain

02:30  Hopsy: waiitt i am playing pong
02:31  Vorspire: haha looking back now, pong could be coded with jQuery... amazing how far things have come lol
02:32  Lumpio-: ...it could be coded in pretty much anything that allows realtime execution and visual output
02:32  Vorspire: well yea, but generalizing it to jQuery is on topic heh
02:33  Lumpio-: ¬_¬
02:33  Vorspire: do it with a batch file if you wanted
02:33  Lumpio-: ew
02:34  Lumpio-: If you're talking Windows's awful shell thing, I'll take Bash over that any time
02:34  Lumpio-: Even though I don't particularly like shell scripts either.
02:34  Vorspire: agreed
02:34  Hopsy: i won! :P
02:34  Vorspire: lul
02:34  Hopsy: pardon me :O
02:34  Vorspire: grats, you bet the very first AI ever developed xD
02:35  Vorspire: beat*
02:35  j0hng4lt: Making intellisense work for arbitrary strings is complicated... And I don't see a reason to use a magic string for a method call if the methods are finite and can be known in advance - other than not having to call .end()
02:35  Lumpio-: Well
02:35  danheberden: breaking the entire flow and style of a library seems like a great reason
02:35  danheberden: or not breaking, rather
02:36  Lumpio-: If you really really wanted you could kind of do $(this).dialog.foo()
02:36  Lumpio-: But it would be seriously meh
02:36  Hopsy: ?translate lul @ Vorspire
02:36  bot-t: Vorspire, Translation (Dutch -> English) - dick
02:36  Vorspire: lmfao
02:36  Vorspire: note to self, don't say lul
02:37  Hopsy: lol i was in shock
02:37  Vorspire: isowwy
02:38  Vorspire: Ik verontschuldig me
02:38  Lumpio-: I am outraged by your indignifying language
02:38  j0hng4lt: Not every method in jQuery returns jQuery. .attr() returns a string. And I don't see how it would break the style anymore than the introduction of lambdas breaks the style of php or c#
02:38  danheberden: j0hng4lt: a getter is diferent than setting properties
02:39  danheberden: attr('whatever', true).keepOnChaininBuddy(
02:39  Lumpio-: Stuff like .attr aren't followed by more jQuery stuff
02:39  danheberden: getting finite data is different
02:39  Lumpio-: However it makes sense to follow dialog actions with more
02:39  luistar15: great support, I did it myself although is not jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/ZAhfz/4/
02:39  Lumpio-: Also is ?translate an actual translator? ¬_¬
02:39  j0hng4lt: At the same time, end() is a valid concern because I've met developers who never knew it existed
02:39  Lumpio-: luistar15: You ignored all my instructions for you
02:39  Lumpio-: Not my fault
02:40  Vorspire: hmm if a jQuery getter is called andthen chained, does the second function call not call end() on the previous getter to find the previous selection?
02:40  danheberden: j0hng4lt: most don't understand the stack
02:40  danheberden: i've been writing a post on it
02:40  Lumpio-: Vorspire: How do you chain after a getter ¬_¬
02:40  Lumpio-: attr() returns a string
02:40  Lumpio-: You can only chain... string methods with it.
02:40  Vorspire: yea, just in underlying code, the getter could still store the selection stack
02:40  Vorspire: ahh nevermind
02:41  Vorspire: the theory is more than i thought out
02:41  Vorspire: it would involve caching and overhead
02:42  danheberden: that's just the thing - while the string to close the dialog or whatever may suite itself, in that application, better as a method of an object - the overall methodology of the library would suffer
02:42  danheberden: and in the end, that methodology is pretty sweet
02:42  danheberden: and really, you're splitting hairs worrying about how dialog works - my best is the application calling dialog is what needs that thought and convern
02:42  snover: I’m sorry, is someone trying to advocate chaining *getters*?
02:43  danheberden: e.g. javascriptmvc or backbone
02:43  l4rk: get("ho").get("ho").make("money").fuck("bitches")
02:43  addyosmani: lol
02:43  Vorspire: snover; step outside the box for a moment and consider the possiblities
02:43  Lumpio-: .yo()
02:43  danheberden: jquery.myGetThingy(uh..the second one i got?);
02:43  l4rk: oh whoops i'm in #jquery
02:43  l4rk: pardon my language
02:44  danheberden: ffs
02:44  j0hng4lt: If dialog() returned an object, and all methods in that object except getters and .end() returned the same object, it would work fine, and it would give you intellisense.... But I do agree that relying on .end(), which many don't understand, can be problematic
02:44  snover: Vorspire: There are no possibilities, dude. You can’t GET a different thing and then continue changing the original thing you got it from
02:44  l4rk: lol combining the accessor and mutator
02:44  danheberden: snover, did you not see my idea?
02:44  danheberden: jeez man, think outside the box
02:44  Vorspire: you can if the function chained straight after can access a cache for the selection the getter ws called on
02:44  snover: What????
02:44  l4rk: duh dude
02:45  Vorspire: you wouldn't understand
02:45  l4rk: why did nt u think of that
02:45  danheberden: </sarcasm>
02:45  snover: Those words in that order don’t make any sense
02:45  hugleo: http://www.cottonbarn.info/qscroller/test.htm
02:45  Vorspire: [] -< the box, you should stepo outside of it.
02:45  Lumpio-: I like my box
02:45  Lumpio-: It makes me feel comfortable
02:45  snover: Vorspire: A different occupation, you should find one.
02:45  l4rk: Vorspire: you are challenging fundamental programming ideas, shaking up the pot
02:45  l4rk: i like it
02:46  l4rk: i need someone like you on my team
02:46  Vorspire: snover; tell me again what you think my occupation actually is?
02:46  l4rk: team enterprise
02:46  coldhead: vice president of sales?
02:46  Lumpio-: Patty flipping technician?
02:46  coldhead: junior executive vice president of sales "stay off the east side"
02:47  Lumpio-: Now, Vorspire, even if you could chain stuff after a getter
02:47  Lumpio-: ...where would the getter store its value?
02:47  Vorspire: meh, not my problem if you guys can't think outside the normal parameters that are passed to your eyes
02:47  Lumpio-: Let's try a real life example
02:47  j0hng4lt: I once tried designing an HTML/XML markup library that made it next to impossible to produce something that's not well-formed (exception through a specially designated method. It was using the same stack model. And I ran into the same problem. No one understood the stack and the end() method
02:47  aaroninfidel: is there a way I can attach to an object and have it tell me what its a descendent of? like window, document, etc...?
02:47  j0hng4lt: The library was in php (not jQuery)
02:47  Lumpio-: Say I want to get two attributes from an element
02:48  Vorspire: Hell, I'm going to write this one up to see if it's possible, and btw, snover, tard, if you didn't step into the convo half way through you'd realise it was a theory not a statement
02:48  Lumpio-: How would I do that by chaining getters?
02:48  erichynds: lawl
02:48  Lumpio-: You /could/ theoretically do something silly like
02:48  TF22Raptor: Hi guys what is it called, when you scroll down a page and the viewable content area expands down (becomes visable) as you scroll??? Its a jquery thing, anyone know??
02:48  Lumpio-: var values = $("derp").attr("foo").attr("bar").actuallyGet();
02:48  danheberden: ya'll are still talking about that?
02:48  Lumpio-: Where the attrs would add the fetched values to the jQuery object passed around and actuallyGet would extract the two values as an array
02:48  snover: aaroninfidel: attach?
02:49  Lumpio-: But that would be confusing as hell and would add no value.
02:49  j0hng4lt: How about .yesreallygetforsure()?
02:49  Hopsy: :O
02:49  Lumpio-: TF22Raptor: It's called the thing where the viewable content area expands when you scroll down
02:49  Hopsy: awesome stuff http://www.andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/walking/
02:50  danheberden: and then instead of calling any function, we could have a function dispatcher, FunctionDispatcher.getReady().sure?().jQuery(document).ready(
02:50  Lumpio-: And it's not really "a jQuery thing", but quite doable with jQuery
02:50  aaroninfidel: snover: basically something that would work like this somevar.descendentOf and then it would return something like window, document, etc.
02:50  danheberden: and instead of a 'getter' we could store some big stack of variables and get them with secret phrases and codes
02:51  snover: aaroninfidel: what are you trying to do?
02:51  aaroninfidel: snover: build a visually impressive debugger :D
02:51  snover: danheberden: If only stupid JavaScript let us, we could pass pointers to memory addresses and let the getter populate that way :(((
02:51  snover: aaroninfidel: uh, wut?
02:51  danheberden: snover - omg, could you imaging
02:51  Lumpio-: http://www.andrew-hoyer.com/
02:51  Lumpio-: gah
02:51  danheberden: *imagine
02:51  Vorspire: aaroninfidel; he's capable of writing patches...
02:51  Lumpio-: That thing is full of syntax errors
02:51  danheberden: you think we get a lot of questions in here now...
02:51  Lumpio-: Missing comma, unescaped quotes
02:51  aaroninfidel: snover: well, not really a debugger...
02:52  aaroninfidel: I'll show you.
02:52  snover: aaroninfidel: please do :)
02:52  j0hng4lt: Pointers, eh? How about an asm keyword like in C?
02:52  TF22Raptor: Limpio- I guess I am trying to do this http://plugins.learningjquery.com/expander/demo/index.html but instead of a click to exapand the content, I just want to scroll and then have it expand?
02:53  Lumpio-: Objects can be used as pointers!
02:53  Lumpio-: var val1 = {}, val2 = {}; $("hurr").attr("durr", val1).attr("derp", val2);
02:53  Vorspire: snover; why is it that you attack me for being creative then when I respond you go all quiet?
02:53  Hopsy: Lumpio-: whats that site you posted there :P
02:53  Lumpio-: And you would get the results in val1.value and val2.value
02:53  j0hng4lt: Or execMachineCode(10000111010000011...)
02:53  Lumpio-: Hopsy: You posted it first o__O
02:53  snover: Vorspire: Sorry, what did I fail to respond to?
02:53  Lumpio-: Oh no... it's machine code!
02:54  Lumpio-: Vorspire: There's a difference between creating useful things and creating stupid things.
02:54  Hopsy: ?eval execMachineCode(10000111010000011);
02:54  bot-t: Hopsy: ReferenceError: execMachineCode is not defined
02:54  snover: Lumpio-: You could even use an array and it could push shit onto the array! Wow!
02:54  Lumpio-: I guess both count as creativity, but nothing good comes out of the latter.
02:54  Hopsy: its not defined yet
02:54  Lumpio-: snover: oooo
02:54  snover: I think we just reinvented C!
02:54  Vorspire: If someone didn't create a "stupid thing" IE Pong.. where would the gaming industry be right now? same for the internet.. they said it was stupid.. so where is your logic now?
02:54  aaroninfidel: snover: can I send a file to you via IRC I'm behind a pretty restrictive DNS at work...
02:54  snover: aaroninfidel: It won’t work even if you try :)
02:54  Lumpio-: Vorspire: I don't think Pong was stupid
02:55  Lumpio-: I think it was pretty cool.
02:55  Lumpio-: Or still is
02:55  Hopsy: so true Vorspire ;p
02:55  aaroninfidel: snover: yay!
02:55  snover: aaroninfidel: Is it pastebin-able?
02:55  snover: aaroninfidel: or gyazo-able?
02:55  aaroninfidel: it's a picture
02:55  snover: aaroninfidel: or jsfiddle-able?
02:55  aaroninfidel: snover: and I don't know of a site I can upload too
02:56  snover: tinypic? photobucket?
02:56  aaroninfidel: because open dns is blocking all file sharing sites it knows of.
02:56  Lumpio-: >openDNS
02:56  Lumpio-: Not very "open" now is it
02:56  Lumpio-: Switch to another DNS server
02:56  jonkri: why does not the function openPopup() (from popup.js) get called when i do this: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/282932/ ... if i uncomment the three jquery lines it works
02:56  Lumpio-: Also I think blocking websites is retarded
02:56  Vorspire: If a "thing" is "stupid" to soemone, then it's clearly a matter of opinion or a lac of understanding...
02:56  Lumpio-: If you can't trust your employeed not to waste too much time on them, maybe you should fire them :V
02:56  aaroninfidel: snover: got it

02:57  snover: aaroninfidel: Looks like you are trying to replace Developer Tools/Firebug/things that already exist.
02:57  Lumpio-: (And this is a company with tens, if not hundreds of thousands of employees, so it's not exactly a small one)
02:58  Vorspire: snover; if people didn't replace existing things, we would all be stuck wth IE right now
02:58  Hopsy: danheberden: how did you get the admin status :O
02:58  Lumpio-: (I mean the guy who e-mailed me was one of them)
02:58  Vorspire: infact, Netscape actually
02:58 @danheberden: hax
02:58  aaroninfidel: snover: I'm looking to make a mobile debug kit for safari.
02:58  Lumpio-: Netscape wasn't the first browser ¬_¬
02:58  aaroninfidel: snover: iphone*
02:58  Lumpio-: Good luck
02:58  snover: Vorspire: Go ahead and tell me how your mind-bogglingly brilliant idea involving fucking up the way accessors work is going to provide a paradigm shift in computing. Please.
02:58  Lumpio-: Apple doesn't want you messing with their stuff
02:58  erichynds: snover, step back, he knows 10 programming languages
02:58  MatthewG: aaroninfidel: mobile debug kit for safari? That'd be awesome, some of us in #mobile-webdev would love that :)
02:59  Vorspire: snover; how about you try to understand it without the need for abusive language, then we'll talk when you grow some pubes?
02:59  aaroninfidel: MatthewG: I'm already using that channel.
02:59  snover: Vorspire: It’s kinda hard to legitimately take the high road when you tell someone to “grow some pubes”, after you got done calling them a “tard”
02:59  MatthewG: aaroninfidel: nice :) let me know when it's done and we can get it in the topic for testing or something
02:59  aaroninfidel: snover: so... any ideas?
03:00 @danheberden: or even take that person seriously
03:00  snover: aaroninfidel: As far as I am aware there is no way to inspect the current scope from within JS

04:33  beeradb: so I've got a situation where I'm binding double click events to some images which are linked — is there a way I can cancel the single click when the double click event happens? what is happening right now is that the double click fires, but the user still follows the link
04:39  disappearedng_: Hey anyone here uses the jixedbar

04:39  renat_rafikov: beeradb: $("#link").click(function(){return false}).dblclick(function(){alert("")});
04:40  beeradb: renat_rafikov: hmm, the issue is that will disable the link entirely, I just want two different behaviors between single clicking and double clicking
04:42  beeradb: I get the feeling am I going to have to do something like a set_timeout in the click method, and unsetting it in the double click? but perhaps there is a better way?
04:46  Vorspire: beeradb; use a local variable outside of the event handlers that changes from true to false depending on the click or double-click, put checks inside both click and couble-click handers that check that state
04:47  snover: Vorspire: that still requires a timeout.

05:22  conee: hey, is there any way to pass a variable to the selector?  i have a set of radio buttons with different dynamic values (pulled from the backend) and i create a set of hidden divs that correspond to each radio button.  i want to show each div upon clicking the corresponding radio button (divs are tagged with classes that are the same as the radio button values). my current attempt was to grab
05:22  conee: the value of the button, store it as a variable, and pass that onto another function that calls a $(".class").show() on it, but i'm uncertain as to how to have the selector accept a variable.  is the way i'm approaching this the best way, or is there an easier way to do it?
05:23 @coldhead: $('.' + someVar)
05:23 @coldhead: the selector can be a string
05:23  snover: conee: the same way any string can be concatenated with another string stored in a variable
05:23 @coldhead: so build the string however you like
05:23 * coldhead shutsup
05:23  rmurphey: conee: if there's a clear dom relationship between the radio button and the div, you could also do it that way

06:04  kiriban: hello, i've got a question regarding selectors. i am in a forEach loop and have a domNode which is stored in a variable called "node".  i want to have a jquery query selector return the img tags below the node. hence, i am attempting $(node "img") but that is failing

06:06  ajpiano: ?concatobj @ kiriban
06:06  bot-t: kiriban, You cannot concatenate an object to a string, which is what you're trying to do with $(this + " selector"). If you want to use an element reference as the context for a search, use $(this).find("elem") or $("elem",this).

06:18  Vorspire: or does that only work with jQuery objects
06:18  progrock: I have a feeling uaing jquery is liekly not the fastest way

06:22 @coldhead: implemented*

06:23  Vorspire: excuse me coldhead, i sneezed and suddenly my e key became an i key :)
06:23  Vorspire: maybe i shouldn't have pulled them off the keyboard and changed them over...
06:24  progrock: I kinda wanna get this mouse object workin, have a possible implementation commented out.. but I'm trying to figure out a better way to speed it up
06:25  Vorspire: well mousemove is fired on every single pixel change, so you're going to have to sacrifice smoothness for performance :/
06:25  progrock: Well I already throttled that
06:26  Vorspire: It's only slightly laggy, but it's pretty good the way it is :D

06:31  Vorspire: progrock; you're seriously gonna drop that effect? :P
06:32  progrock: yup, jsut do css change, no need to animate it
06:32  Vorspire: ohh I see
06:33  Vorspire: I thought you meant, drop the effect all together
06:33  Vorspire: leave it static
06:33 --- willd[a]yble is now known as willdayble
06:34  progrock: haha, nevermind.. looks horrible without the animation
06:35  Vorspire: aww that's a shame
06:36  Vorspire: hmm, i noticed you split the whole thing into 3 or more sections, does each section have it's own mouseover event attached, or did you superceed all sections with one event?
06:37  progrock: I jsut made a box aroudn the top rigth to follow the mosue
06:37  progrock: otherwise go to default position
06:38  progrock: might do some stupid little additionsliek make the default position based on the tome of day.. ad maybe change the backgroudn image coloring based on time as well
06:38  progrock: time*
06:38  Vorspire: that would be neat
06:39  progrock: yeah, would only take a minute or two, and won;t hurt performance at all I figure
06:39 --- willdayble is now known as willd[a]yble
06:40  Vorspire: what would be nice is a function to find Pixels Per Second - mouse speed from mousemove :P
06:41  Vorspire: you could have little quirks taht run by mouse speed too then
06:41  progrock: Vorspire: taht would take a few seconds to impleemnt the way I am doign it
06:42  Vorspire: :)
06:42  progrock: I also did it originally all with polar values (degree and distance)... so got a few ideas for stuid little games and such
06:42  Vorspire: i'm interested to see your final result
06:42  progrock: but, thats when i have actual time to spare, not jsut procrastinating
06:42  Vorspire: haha :D
06:42  Vorspire: you said you want paidwrk, i bet you could fill your boots at http://scriptlance.com

06:47  progrock: haha... currently gett 75 ;)
06:47  progrock: just not enough hours a year
06:47  Vorspire: ^^
06:48  progrock: will be much nicer geting paid for 40 hours a week.. tho imight shot myself doing 9-5
06:48  progrock: shoot*
06:48  Vorspire: but as a private contract, dev to dev, $20 is reasonable :P
06:48  Vorspire: yeah 9-5 is the bomb
06:49  Vorspire: how much would you charge for a web-based game UI design, the graphics, but not the code?
06:49  progrock: yeah.. honestly if I was doing somethign I had fun with, people usually end out getting the better deal with me
06:50  progrock: I'm really nott hat strong with graphics.. took too much time off
06:50  Vorspire: hehe, I fail miserably at design :/

06:54  joshsmith: oh, so I can just set var data = $('#some-random-id').load(url, data); ?
06:54  joshsmith: and then use the data that way?

07:49  tes1: Hi,  i am trying to create drop-down menus, soo i found and checked this tutorial: http://www.queness.com/post/966/jquery-drop-down-menu-for-rss-subscription-tutorial this is all fine, but i would like to have more than 1 menu on the same page. Menus will be generated from array soo i don't know how i should setup css and *.js file. Current problem is, because all have the same class and id tag, when i select first one all menus are ex
07:54  rhizmoe: are two sortable ul's ok? i'm getting weird update requests from my second one on the page.
07:54  Aristata: I am having an impossible time hooking this animate stuff up to a link
07:55  rhizmoe: accordion
07:55  Aristata: I have tried binding it, on clicking it, making the href go to javascript:animateLeft();
07:55  Aristata: I have put the function in and outside of document load
07:56  Aristata: What's the accepted way of binding a link to a js function?
07:56  Aristata: And I am not getting errors either… When I just put the code in the console it works...

07:57  rhizmoe: i do something like $("#foo").click(function(){...
07:57  Aristata: This is what my link looks like: <a href="#" id="left-scroll-large"></a>
07:57  Aristata: And my js:
07:58  Aristata: $("a#right-scroll-large").click(function () {});
07:58  Vorspire: $('#left-scroll-large').click(function(e){ /*your code*/ });
07:58  Aristata: e huh
07:58  Aristata: oops
07:58  Vorspire: e is optional
07:58  Aristata: well I shouldn't need the event should i
07:58  Vorspire: its event data
07:58  Aristata: Yeah
07:59  Aristata: So I am befoozled
07:59  Aristata: Should it be in our out of document ready?
07:59  Vorspire: inside ready
07:59  Aristata: in correct?
07:59  Aristata: yeah
07:59  Vorspire: yea
07:59  Vorspire: try it without the 's' in the selector
07:59  Vorspire: 'a'*
07:59  Aristata: ...
08:00  Aristata: Something just gave
08:00  Aristata: Working now
08:00  Aristata: It's too late
08:00  Vorspire: hehe
08:00  Aristata: Thanks guys, this works perfect
08:00  Vorspire: since the ID is already an a tag, you don't need to specify the a-tag in the selector
08:05  Northwoods: to store data with an element with custom attribute , can i use <input type='button' data='myData' >
08:05  Vorspire: data-attr
08:05  Vorspire: where attr is the name you want to use

08:30  triyo: I need some help with this selector please: find("span[style*='border: black']") .. It doesn't seem to work in firefox, I;'m testing on 3.6
08:31  triyo: Why is this the case. And how would I go about this to make it cross-browser compliant?
08:31  triyo: any direction on I'd greatly appreciate.
08:32  triyo: *on this
08:34  VladDrac: does the tag actually have this style literally?
08:34  VladDrac: (in stead of through css)
08:35  Vorspire: yea the style tag will contain that
08:35  triyo: <span style="position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:240px; top:221px; width:84px; height:0px;"></span>
08:35  Vorspire: black or #000000
08:35  VladDrac: right, so you expect more like a substring match. Not sure if that will work
08:35  Vorspire: triyo, does firefox translate literal colors to RGB hex?
08:35  Northwoods: Vorspire: $(this).attr('data-filter') , worked :)
08:36  triyo: Good question :)
08:36  Vorspire: Northwoods; grats :D
08:36  triyo: I can test that quick
08:38  Northwoods: any way to check if an array is empty or not ?
08:38  triyo: .length
08:39  Vorspire: find("span[style*='border']").filter(function(){ return ($(this).css('border') === 'black'); ) });
08:39  Vorspire: may work for you triyo
08:39  Northwoods: sorry , that was stupid question sort of  , since we use !empty() in php
08:39  triyo: Vorspire: thanks, I'll give that a quick go
08:39  Vorspire: empty returns false if a php variable is set to 0, bad when you need it to actually be 0 :P
08:40  Northwoods: Vorspire: for php arrays
08:40  Northwoods: yes , empty is pretty powerful
08:40  Northwoods: for values coming from db in php
08:40  Vorspire: if(isset( $arr ) && !empty( $arr ) ) ?
08:40  Northwoods: most of them are detected by empty
08:41  Vorspire: you could also do if( sizeof( $arr ) == 0 )
08:41  Vorspire: or count( $arr )
08:41  Vorspire: xD
08:41  triyo: Vorspire: find("span[style*='border']").length == 0 in firefox .... and == 120 in chrome :(
08:42  Vorspire: triyo, that's odd aint it :D
08:42  triyo: bug? :)
08:42  Vorspire: possibly
08:42  Vorspire: hmm
08:43  triyo: Hehe, I'm on 1.4.2, maybe by some luck 1.4.3 works
08:43  Vorspire: find("span").filter(function(index){ return ($(this).css('border') === 'black'); ) });
08:43  Vorspire: of course!
08:43  Vorspire: thats it!
08:43  Vorspire: :P
08:43  Vorspire: that will reduce the selection to all spans with a black border
08:44  Vorspire: hmm i think FireFox may use border-color by default
08:44  Aristata: Ok guys, I have a div in a div, the outer being larger than the inner. I want a mouseout function on the larger, but it is being called as I move into the inner div, which in my mind should not trigger mouseout… Is there a way to get around this?
08:44  Aristata: Short of hacking jquery that is
08:44  Vorspire: why oh why can't they just merge the awesomeness of chrome with the features of firefox and kill off IE and we can all be happy with a hybrid :D
08:44  Aristata: amen
08:45  ajpiano: Aristata, use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout
08:45  Aristata: ok!
08:45  Vorspire: Aristata; think you may need e.stopPropogation
08:45  Vorspire: *may* need
08:46  triyo: Vorspire: I tried find("span[style*='border-color']").length
08:46  marlun: If I want to create a jquery plugin which needs to kepe state and I want a class like object where I've got functions and can access "object variables" using this.var or self.var in the functions, how should I do it? Anyone know of a tutorial showing something like that?
08:46  triyo: nothing changed.
08:46  Vorspire: triyo, this should work; find("span").filter(function(index){ return ($(this).css('border') === 'black'); ) });
08:46  triyo: Oh I see
08:46  Aristata: How on earth do I do the propogation thing? The mouseleave is creating more problems of a different sort.
08:47  Aristata: wait
08:47  Aristata: google
08:47  Vorspire: Aritista; say you have .click(function(e){ e.stopPropogation(); })
08:47  Vorspire: for example
08:47  Vorspire: but it still may not be what you need :P
08:49  dinosaadeh: guys, is there a way when i fadeOut('fast', function() { $(anotherobject).fadeIn() }); to have an effect of both happening at the same time? I mean like one image is disappearing while the other is blending in and showing up
08:49  Vorspire: triyo; i think i added an extra ) by accident to that code snippet :)
08:49  Aristata: I don't think it is, now the mouseout just plain isn't doing anything
08:49  Aristata: I think I have an idea though
08:49  triyo: Vorspire: no problem thanks I saw it
08:49  Vorspire: dinosaadeh; yes, don't call the fadeIn from the fadeOut callback, instead, just call it after
08:50  triyo: Vorspire: length == 0 on all browsers, strange
08:50  Vorspire: triyo; i'm gonna try a jsfiddle with this possible bug :S
08:51  triyo: Vorspire: ok I just tried find("span").filter(function(index){ return ($(this).css('border-color') === 'black'); }).length and got the right value in Chrome and Firefox returned 0!!
08:52  Northwoods: $("#hint").val(""); to reset its value to blank , input type='text' id='hint'
08:52  triyo: this must be a bug
08:52  Northwoods: ?
08:52  Vorspire: Northwoods, should work :)
08:53  Northwoods: yes , something with cache , now worked
08:55  triyo: Vorspire: wow, I just upgraded to 1.4.3 and reran "find("span").filter(function(index){ return ($(this).css('border-color') === 'black'); }).length and got the right value in Chrome and Firefox returned 0!!" -> and now both Chrome and FireFox return 0
08:56  berttrand: how do I use the attribute selector to have the criteria *between* two values... e.g. select all inputs where the value is greater than 2 but less than 5
08:56  Vorspire: triyo; i'm confused xD
08:56  triyo: makes two of us
08:56  Aristata: Drat my idea isnt going to work
08:57  Vorspire: bertrand; you'd have to write a filter function :)
08:57 --- frigginAsleep is now known as frigginWork
08:57  berttrand: ok, Vorspire, thats what I thought but was hoping for off-the-shelf
08:58  Aristata: Oh nevermind it did
08:58  Aristata: So, on fadeOut's call back, shouldn't that only happen after the thing has completely faded out?
08:59  dingding: Hi I would like to know if there are any jquery plugins that can simulate similar effects when a link is shared on facebook?
08:59  dingding: Does anyone have an idea?
08:59  Aristata: dingding:  I don't quite follow
09:00  Aristata: Although I have never been the social networker so I have no idea what happens when you click that stuff.
09:00  anli_: Is it possible using jquery to obtain non-selectable text on a webpage?
09:01  dingding: Aristata: eg when you wish to share links in facebook, you get a preview of the 1st paragraph of the text on the webpage, as well as thumbnail previews of images on the webpage
09:01  Aristata: probably just have an iframe or something get displayed?
09:03  anli_: triyo: maybe its not black but #000000
09:04  triyo: anli_: tried it, no luck
09:06  anli_: triyo: Maybe you can use classes instead?
09:06  triyo: Vorspire: ok this is really funny. find("span").filter(function(index){ console.log($(this).attr("style")); return ($(this).css('border-color') === '#000000'); }) -> prints the whole style as expected
09:06  anli_: === seems to be overkill btw
09:06  triyo: find("span").filter(function(index){ console.log($(this).css("border-color")); return ($(this).css('border-color') === '#000000'); } returns blank
09:07  triyo: so does find("span").filter(function(index){ console.log($(this).attr("style")); return ($(this).css('border') === '#000000'); }
09:07  triyo: I mean ... find("span").filter(function(index){ console.log($(this).css("border")); return ($(this).css('border') === '#000000'); }
09:07  anli_: Maybe you can have a certain class on those spans? What makes spans with black text color interesting?
09:07  triyo: note the console log part
09:07  anli_: border color, I meant
09:07  triyo: print blank for all except attr("style") one
09:09  triyo: anli_: unfortunately I don't have control over the "generated" html by pdf tool
09:09  triyo: I am looking to just apply style to it at runtime
09:10  anli_: What do you intend to do with the spans with black border color?
09:10  Vorspire: triyo; http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/8mB7A/
09:11 --- SphynXz_b is now known as SphynXz
09:11  anli_: Aha, maybe Vorspire has an answer
09:12  triyo: Vorspire: hahah exactly what I had in mind to try :)... I could do regex on attr("style")
09:12  Vorspire: triyo, yeah, that code could be safer though :P
09:13  triyo: Vorspire: got it ;-)
09:13  triyo: works
09:14  triyo: doesnt .css return computed style? :)
09:14  triyo: So then going the attr("style") is by far safer and doable route
09:14  schu: hello there
09:14  Cork: no it returns the same as element.style
09:15  Vorspire: triyo, i've never used .filter before, but from the console.log it only seems to pass 'this' as the element but not a jQuery object, it's confusing
09:15  Cork: Vorspire: thats normal just do $(this)
09:16  triyo: right wrap element in JQuery function
09:16  Vorspire: I did console.log($(this)) and got [<span style='blah'></span>]
09:16  schu: can anyone point me at a solution to the following problem: i've got an unordered list with LI elements. now i want to encapsulate pairs of two with </UL><UL>, but the problem is that when i use after() or some wrap, jquery adds <UL></UL> and thus renders my code useless
09:16  triyo: Vorspire: hmm, thats odd
09:18  Vorspire: triyo; this code is safer, because it won't overrun into the next possible property; http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/8mB7A/
09:18  Vorspire: but as you said, you could use regex, but regex may be slower
09:21  sean`: triyo, why use the style attribute
09:21  sean`: serously makes no sense
09:22  Vorspire: ahh sean` :) why does .filter behaviour differ from something like .each when assigning 'this'? in console.log($(this)) i got '[<span style="blah"></span>]' is this proper behaviour?
09:22  sean`: dude
09:23  sean`: that's a jquery object
09:23  sean`: you're not logging this, you're logging a jquery object
09:23  triyo: sean`: generated html from pdf library. no control over generated html
09:23  Vorspire: usually when i do log($(this)) i get Object ->
09:23  triyo: hence stuck with inlined style attributes
09:23  sean`: Vorspire, perhaps you've got an updated version of your console
09:23  sean`: triyo, doesn't mean you need to use them
09:25  Vorspire: sean` - i think you might be right, Chrome did do an update last time i re-opened it :/ but this console update kinda suck because it won't output all of the members of the jquery object.. or is there a reason for that?
09:25  Vorspire: sean`; because even $(this).css when used with .filter, doesn't seem to work
09:26  snover: sean`: He means “▸ Object”

09:52  triyo: and it does in Chrome but not in my FF again :)
09:52  Vorspire: lol
09:52  Vorspire: typical
09:52  triyo: its been a really crappy morning so far
09:53  snover: triyo: document.activeElement
09:54  triyo: snover: thanks. No need for fallbacks? Will property always exist?
09:54  snover: triyo: no, and yes, in that order
09:55  triyo: great, thanks
09:56  Northwoods: Vorspire: if i run an ajax request with jquery , and user submits the page , will the php script continue to run or halt ?
09:56  triyo: So this var focusedEl = $(document.activeElement); instead of $("input:focus" seems to work well)
09:58  Vorspire: Northwoods, the php script will continue I guess, until success
09:58  snover: Northwoods: Depends on if you have called ignore_user_abort in PHP or not
10:01  Northwoods: snover: if set to true , will work without being affected , even if source page has been swtiched to some other page
10:01  Northwoods: ?
10:02  snover: Northwoods: it won’t abort. obviously you can’t send anything back tough.
10:02  snover: though*

10:05  vak: .load() assumes the url leads to usual HTML. In my case the URL leads to JSON and the html content is a data value of the JSON field "html". How to .load() it? :-/
10:05  Vorspire: dataType: 'json'
10:06  vak: Vorspire: and how to pass the field name?..
10:07  snover: vak: .load is not the correct method for you.
10:07  vak: snover: OK. Which one is right?
10:07  Vorspire: getJSON
10:07  snover: $.ajax, $.get, $.getJSON, take your pick
10:08  vak: Vorspire: snover: OK, i try it, thanks!

10:13  openprotocol: I'm wondering what the correct method to create a toggle such that when you click it shows 1 div in a class and hides all others?
10:14  openprotocol: i understand how to have a toggle that shows all, or hides all
10:14  openprotocol: but i cant figure out how to get it to just show the one i want and hide others

Menus will be generated from array soo i don't know how i should setup css and *.js file. Current problem is, because all have the same class and id tag, when i select 
10:19  tes1: any help would be appreciated :)

10:20  seutje: ☺
10:20  Vorspire: ^^
10:20  seutje: I feel nasty when doing that :(
10:21  Vorspire: but it's more dynamic to make target === '#my_div' incase target could also be a class
10:21  Vorspire: depends on the context :P
10:21  Vorspire: seutje; everyone is entitled to their say ^^
10:22  feisar: Thanks for the help guys. I am aware of fadeIn(). what would be the best way to add fadein to this? $( 'li.navli a[href="' + path + '"]' ).parent( ).addClass( 'navliact' );
10:22  Vorspire: .fadeIn(); on the end?
10:23  Vorspire: you want to fade the parent or the original selection?
10:23  ablemike: ahhh it's just a simple string
10:23  ablemike: duh
10:23  feisar: Vorspire: oh right, that simple thanks. I want to fade in the class that is added to the li element
10:24  tes1: anyone? :/
10:24  seutje: u want to fade a class?
10:24  seutje: u can only fade elements :x
10:24  feisar: the class I add using jquery adds a border. Is there a way of fading that in?

10:26  Vorspire: var selection = $( 'li.navli a[href="' + path + '"]' ); selection.parent().addClass('navliact').fadeIn(); //seperated vars for future accessibility
10:26  feisar: thank you
10:26  tes1: markj: that was ment for me toggleClass?
10:26  Vorspire: tes1; review the original question you askd, it was cut off half way xD
10:27  tes1: hmm, well i ended it by moment...   <-- here u mean?
10:28  Vorspire: "when i select" - then it cuts off
10:28  markj: its actually not much good for anyone, i mean the jquery ui addclass I think, was aimed at feisar though
10:28  tes1: lol =)
10:29  tes1: well, when i select one element to show drop-down menu, all menus are expanded (which is ofc correct, since all share the same id and class), i could ofc add every one different id, but then i dont know how to add some style from css to each one of them
10:29  sd: Hi, I want to refrehs the content of a divbox, not the whole page. How can I accomplish that?
10:31  tes1: and then how to register hover element function to each genericly generated id...
10:31  neeon: Hi!
10:31  Vorspire: tes1; are you giving 2 different elements the same id attribute value? because that's a no-no :)
10:31  Vorspire: 2 or more, for that matter
10:32  feisar: Vorspire: thanks, but I got a little confused there. Is that code you gave me to work without having to use jquery-ui?
10:32  Vorspire: without jQueryUI? good luck :D
10:32  thyphus: i am searching for a editable select/input with autocompletition. however, all/multiple inputs should access one database/table!
10:32  tes1: Vorspire: i know its a no-no =)  but currently yes...   because i have no idea how to make css style for ids like #test1 #test2 #test3...
10:32  neeon: I'm trying to do something when the mouse moves over a page..but not when it's over an spesified DIV. how do i get the dom name of that div?
10:32  seutje: RobW: heh, how does that work, does it grab the styles applied to that class (figuring out the specificity shit and all) and then tries to animate those?
10:33  seutje: emphasis on "tries"
10:33  feisar: Vorspire: so I need jqueryUI to fade in the adding of a class?
10:33  markj: tes1 #foo,#foo1,#foo2 ?
10:33  seutje: seems mighty efficient :|
10:34  Vorspire: tes1; imagine you have a <div> that has only <a> inside it, a few of them... you do $('div > a').each(function(){ $(this).css({ 'color': '#000000' }); });
10:34  Vorspire: just as example
10:34  tes1: markj: and what if there is 100000 of those elements...? =)  elements would be dynamically generated (and it could have sequential id)
10:34  markj: then you wrap them with a parent container and style its children
10:34  seutje: tes1: when generating them, u can't just add a class?
10:35  neeon: This is my code.. and it dont work.. :( http://pastie.org/1257498
10:36  markj: is there a bot command to tell someone to explain their problem and not say it just doesnt work?

10:53  j0rd: nothing =(
10:53  RobW: do you have code anywhere else that could be 'intercepting' the submit?
10:53  j0rd: it's a wordpress install, so perhaps there's some conflicting code in there
10:53  j0rd: or via a plugin
10:53  Vorspire: does submit need a return true/false?
10:54  RobW: j0rd: perhaps there could be a 'generic' $("form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); code
10:54  j0rd: Vorspire: perhaps...but you should be able to call it blank
10:54  Cork: Vorspire: you mean the submit event?
10:54  RobW: which would be stupid
10:54  j0rd: RobW: hmm perhaps. I'll debug a little bit in ffirebug

10:57  j0rd: .catch-var = undefined. Does that mean anything to anyone?
10:59  j0rd: TypeError: Property 'submit' of object #<an HTMLFormElement> is not a function
10:59  RobW: burg: getData.php is sending a 404 header, why?
10:59  j0rd: hmm
11:00  burg: RobW, i just added this line: header('Content-type: application/json'); - one minute to try again
11:01  burg: RobW, i don`t know why
11:02  j0rd: "I didn't realize that I named the submit button as 'submit' and that why javascript is failing."
11:02  RobW: burg: any weird rewrite rules that could be causing this?
11:02  burg: still the same problem. i have no idea why it is sending 404 header
11:02  j0rd: can not name submit button submit :)
11:02  j0rd: jeez
11:02  j0rd: obscure
11:02  burg: RobW, i don`t have .htaccess in that folder, only in a subfolder
11:03  j0rd: My submit problem: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18090
11:03  RobW: burg: can you paste the code?
11:03  j0rd: i change the name from submit to something else and now it works
11:04  burg: RobW, http://codepad.org/wkK9ohLA
11:04  burg: that`s the whole code from getData.php
11:05  RobW: heh that's strange
11:05  RobW: but perhaps
11:05  RobW: try this: http://codepad.org/SF1E1JMl
11:05  RobW: without all the opening/closing tags
11:05  RobW: and omit the closing tag
11:06  RobW: for osme reason though, I still see the content type as text/html
11:06  Vorspire: burg, the path ./wordpress/ is definitely in the same folder as getData.php?
11:06  RobW: Vorspire: yes, it is
11:06  RobW: otherwise he'd get nothing from WP on http://tiernanssf.com/getData.php?pname=about-us
11:06  Vorspire: ahh didn't see that
11:07  Vorspire: but still, shouldn't have to send a header
11:07  RobW: his script is sending a 404 for some reason lol
11:07  coolguy4: what ways do people here serialise data (an array) when POSTing from javascript to PHP? I'm trying to use JSON but json_decode doesn't seem to work.
11:07  RobW: coolguy4: serialize()
11:08  coolguy4: RobW: ah, thanks :)
11:08  RobW: $("form").submit(function() { $.post("script.php", $(this).serialize(), function(data) { alert(data); }, "json"); }); perhaps
11:08  burg: RobW, changed to your code. but that didn`t fix it
11:09  RobW: burg: did you upload it?
11:10  burg: yes
11:10  RobW: are you sure?
11:10  RobW: I'm still seeing it as text/html
11:10  burg: yes, me too, and i don`t know why. i am shure
11:11  RobW: is that the default wp-blog-header file
11:12  Vorspire: i don't think the header really matters as long as the plaintext conforms to JSON
11:12  sean`: TRUFF
11:12 --- cbibler_ is now known as cbibler
11:12  RobW: i just find it odd that he set the header, yet browser still reports it as text/html which would lead me to believe that elsewhere more headers are being set

11:16  Vorspire: :D

11:16  RobW: burg: I can't even see the page uploaded
11:17  Vorspire: CTRL+F5 for hard-refresh + flush cache
11:17  RobW: j0rd: I mean, are you using $.post or $.get for the submit?
11:18  j0rd: RobW: nothing.I dont want this to be ajax. I just want the form to submit and refresh the page
11:18  RobW: burg: remove the json header
11:18  RobW: burg: or comment it out for now
11:18  burg: RobW, i disabled permalinks in wordpress - it seems that this was the problem
11:18  RobW: j0rd: you just want the form to submit and that's it with nothing JS-side?
11:18  RobW: burg: try the code I pasted but without the json header()
11:19  j0rd: burg: I know why your stuff isn't working
11:19  RobW: j0rd: $("form").submit(function() { return true; }); perhaps?
11:19  RobW: or put it on a listener
11:19  burg: j0rd, why?
11:19  jomofcw: A "sementic" question please ^^. I append to a div some image. I want this image to be "clickable"... I have better to bind directly the click event of the image, or have I to wrap the image in a A element and bind the click event of this A element ?
11:20  j0rd: burg: you are not posting to the right place. You need to be posting to wp-admin/ajax-admin.php . you are probably using ajaxurl in your JS right? That's probably not set. Otherwise you are posting to ajax-admin.php (but not under the wp-admin/ folder)
11:20  jomofcw: semAntic
11:20  j0rd: burg: i would assume
11:20  Vorspire: jomofcw; you don't needthe <a>
11:20  RobW: jomofcw: $("img").click(function() { /* do stuff */ });
11:20  Vorspire: just bind it to the image :)
11:20  j0rd: burg: the wordpress documentation sucks
11:20  Vorspire: applications are usually as good as the documentation that comes withthem
11:21  Vorspire: hence why jQuery is uber godlike
11:21  j0rd: burg: should look like this `jQuery.post('/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php', data, function(response) {}, 'json');
11:21  RobW: burg: what'd you change?
11:21  burg: nevermind, it works now since i disabled permalinks in wordpress. it seems that its .htaccess caused it
11:21  RobW: ah
11:21  j0rd: or get the ajaxurl setup probably in your code

14:23  mushin_: the div (id middle_layer z-index 5) is positioned under div (id draggable3 z-index 6) and the problem is to get the child of draggable3 (id bottom_layer z-index 4) to appear underneath middle_layer. the reason we want to keep draggable3 on top so we can use jquery to drag its contents horisontally over the screen

15:50  eirikb: Hello. Anyone added subtitles to VideoJS?
15:51  eirikb: I tried adding http://plugins.jquery.com/node/11465 (jQuery Subtitles) to it, and this works. But any existing implementation or appending to the default VideoJS would be better
15:56  oodavid: eirikb: I effing love subtitles, but not used VideoJS :(

15:56  onomi: hello, i know its not about jquery but, knows somebody anything like this in flash, for example? http://www.subirimagenes.com/imagen-component-5430264.html
15:56  eirikb: oodavid: Ok. So you would recommend the plugin I have chosen?
15:57  oodavid: just taking a peek now
15:57  oodavid: looks pretty basic, but solid
16:02  pea[0]: hello, i need lots of .toggleslide's but i need to only use one instance of it. how would i 'get' the id so jquery knows which div to slide? http://omgpaste.com/d/nn3fk0/paste.js
16:03  robtarr: Has anybody here used the datalink plugin? I was able to easily add it to a form and gets the values in my object updated, but updating the values in the object don't update the form fields...
16:05  oodavid: jQueer
16:05  oodavid: ooh actually
16:06  oodavid: it's almost time for jBeery

16:18  Today: Hey folks, I have a problem with my select boxes and jeditable. I want extra data from the page submitted whenever the user makes a change to an edit-in-place field. So I use the submitdata: {} params to tell it to send my php page a few extra bits of data along with the new value. (Select box choices in this case)
16:18  pea[0]: i need to do something like this: $("#link\\.entry\\[*]") so when i click link.entry[2] it hides div.entry[2]
16:18  Today: http://pastebin.ca/1976357 is my pastebin to give you an idea of how I submitted it.
16:19  Today: The problem is that it submits the PREVIOUS choices for the select boxes
16:19  Today: Not the current.
16:19  pea[0]: ergh how can a channel with 700 people be so dead
16:19  Today: I select for instance, Bananas and Apples from each dropdown box...and it submits Grapes and Oranges from yesterday when I used it last
16:20  Today: Using firebug...I checked the hidden field I created to see if the new dropdown value was being thrown in there, and it is. So how on earth does the previous selection get submitted instead?
16:20  Today: I tried two ways of getting the select boxes value, neither worked
16:21  Today: I'd always get the PREVIOUS selection.
16:22  DogWater: Are there any good jquery plugins or toolkits for making forms that have various live elements depending on what the user selects?
16:22  Fichte: someon know a browsercompatible way to scroll smoothy to the top of the website?

16:26  Fichte: i am doing it with html, body
16:26  Fichte: working fine
16:27  Fichte: why do u create an if in there?
16:27  oodavid: Fichte: Opera will go a bit akka
16:27  oodavid: you need the fix
16:27  Fichte: cant i just use 'html, body'?
16:27  oodavid: you can
16:27  oodavid: but Opera doesn't like it
16:27  efphe: hello
16:27  Fichte: k

16:28  Fichte: works  fine   thx
16:28  oodavid: np
16:29  Fichte: if u want to append it to somewhere cant u just user clone?

20:05  eTiger13: bartzy: if you really really really need to inject something with php relating to javascript (which you most likely can accomplish some other way) then have a separate script for that
20:05  paul_irish: so fantastic.

20:07  initself: or ids for a particular element have to be unique?
20:07  eTiger13: jrockjiggz:  http://jsfiddle.net/PDDDG/1/ although its not as global as you think. look into namespaces

20:10  eTiger13: who doesnt know who robocop is? thats blasphemous
20:10  initself: SO WHICH IS IT!?
20:10  eTiger13: initself: IDs are unique per page. Classes can be reused as many times on as many elements as you want
20:11  eTiger13: initself: and tizag is NNOOTT the w3c
20:11  initself: true, true
20:12  eTiger13: if you had read even the rest of that page you would have seen (saw? i always get those confused) "Use IDs when there is only one occurence per page. Use classes when there are one or more occurences per page"

20:13  initself: i did read the rest of the page.  I even quoted it to you!
20:14  eTiger13: jrockjiggz:  like i said, look into namespaces. defining the var in the ready statement does not make it global
20:14  jrockjiggz: eTiger13: ok
20:15  eTiger13: silo: you want an accordion
20:15  bubbafoley: stanmancan, try putting that function on the click event for the submit button instead of form submit
20:15  silo: accordion eh, ill look into it :)
20:15  silo: thanks
20:15  eTiger13: stanmancan:  the preventDefault isnt needed in that case, nor is the .submit part
20:16  silo: hrmm no not an accordian i dont think...
20:17  stanmancan: eTiger13: I tried that but it doesn't finish the function I'm calling before submitting the forum, so it doens't complete
20:18  eTiger13: stanmancan:  what is that function doing?

20:22  thepacmanfan: *minified
20:23  eTiger13: tristan_: that selector is all wrong. you should not have multiple hero-overlay ids. this is to reuse code on multiple pages right?

20:27  jrockjiggz: js is evil
20:28  thepacmanfan: eTiger13: it's a simple matter of the merge/minify function in Magento. if it's enabled (the jquery.cycle is being processed this way) the Presentation Cycle script does not work. when i disable the merge/minify function, it works fine.
20:28  thepacmanfan: i know this is very vague. it appears like it is not being loaded, correct.
20:28  eTiger13: thepacmanfan: um ok. so ask in the magento room as it sounds like a magento problem. by chance, have you ran that script through jslint?
20:28  thepacmanfan: Firebug shows that the jquery.cycle code is in the merged file, though.
20:28 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 92 seconds
20:29  thepacmanfan: eTiger13: except that this is the only script that i've had problems with when merging/minifying.
20:29  thepacmanfan: and no i have not.
20:30  thepacmanfan: i'm getting ready to try the non-min version of jquery.cycle... maybe it doesn't like being minified twice :P
20:30  eTiger13:  i thought you said jquery.cycle was fine and its the presentation file
20:30  thepacmanfan: if i said that, i was mixed up.
20:31  thedelchop: anybody?  Json with ui-tabs?
20:31  thepacmanfan: but i AM mixed up... running JSLint now.
20:32  jrockjiggz: :( http://jsfiddle.net/PDDDG/2/ - does anyone know how to get varialbe to show val and not function?

20:34  bot-t: jrockjiggz, http://jsfiddle.net/PDDDG/4/
20:35  jrockjiggz: hmm ok
20:36  eTiger13: yeah perhaps i should have specified the alert in mine wont work as it will be called before the load callback is finished most likely
20:36 +serio_: the code that bot-t posted gives a better idea, see how it alerts once, then again after the ajax request?
20:36 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
20:37  jrockjiggz: yes, the one after is undefined, which is really the one that can be used elsewhere
20:38  jrockjiggz: the problem is i would use $.ajax but it does not support loading portion of file (as .load('file #id') does.)
20:38  sh_sh: hi folks. what is such jquery code about: ';(function($) {...})'
20:38  sh_sh: some semicolon function?
20:38 +serio_: load is just a wrapper that uses $.ajax
20:39  eTiger13: sh_sh:  the semicolon makes sure any js before it is closed and then the function passes in $ to be used with jquery
20:40  jrockjiggz: +serio_: $.ajax({ url: 'index.php #div', success: function(data) { alert(data); }); //returns whole file, not the portion...
20:41  eTiger13: jrockjiggz:  ok then just parse it in the success callback since thats what load does pretty much
20:41 +serio_: this is the wrong way to do ajax btw
20:42 +serio_: the idea is to load less data, not the same amount as a full page request.
20:43  jrockjiggz: +serio_: index.php example is actually only returning data, data is an email template that i'm trying to break apart
20:44  jrockjiggz: to parse data, is it $(data).find('...'); ?
20:45  sh_sh: eTiger13: so when the function is called, what will be passed as '$'?
20:46  sh_sh: like the main jquery object or something like that?
20:46 +serio_: jrockjiggz, I'm still lost on why you're returning data that needs to be parsed
20:46 +serio_: it should be ready to use.

21:01  hdon: hi all :) if i use $('#x .y').click(myHandler) and the set of '#x .y' elements changes, will the new elements have the click handler? if i remove the "y" class from a child element of "#x" will they lose the click handler?
21:01  hdon: i suspect the answer is no but i'm hoping it comes with a "but here's how you get that effect" :)
21:01  Cork[home]: hdon: no see ?.live
21:01  bot-t: hdon, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
21:01  ManxPower: thank you both.  That was helpful
21:01  eTiger13: bot is a bot
21:02  hdon: Cork[home], merci beaucoup
21:02  Cork[home]: hdon: so your second line is correct :D
21:02  jorn: heyho, does anyone have a tip for me how to wait until no visual effect is in process anymore? I know about the callbacks but want to see if there's another way.
21:03  jorn: my client side logic has several states which change... each with a onEnter and onExit method, would be nice to fadout something in a state's onExit and fade something else in in the next states onEnter method
21:05  jorn: if I use callbacks the whole design will get even more complicated... so is there something like a "blocking" .fadeOut call?
21:05 +serio_: callback is the only way
21:06 +serio_: or, you could write a plugin to do what you're describbing, something that keeps track of all animations and when they stop etc.
21:06  Cork[home]: you could try using queue though
21:06  Cork[home]: but you would still have to call it in the callback
21:07  Cork[home]: (queue it where ever you do that, and dequeue it in the callback
21:07  Cork[home]: )
21:07 +serio_: man, this is awesome: http://mrdoob.com/128/IE6_HTML5
21:08  Brodingo: hehe
21:08  Brodingo: like old times
21:08  jorn: Cork[home]: well the problem is that these state changes are triggered from the outside, so at some point it would be nice to just say "state.change(newState)"... state.change then calls oldstate.onExit(), deletes old state and calls newState.onEnter().
21:09  Cork[home]: jorn: there is nothing like that
21:10  eTiger13: paul_irish:  you still around?
21:10  paul_irish: no
21:10  jorn: but now some of these states might loop, so they're faded out (onExit), some vars shall be changed (onEnter) and faded in (onEnter)... but I end up with an empty guy cause the effects are concurrent
21:10  thepacmanfan: alright, i'm finally getting this merged/minified script thing narrowed down... this only happens when the presentationCycle and jquery.cycle script are done together.
21:10  jorn: Cork[home]: ok, thanks for your thoughts though
21:10  thepacmanfan: if one is merged/minified and the other is included standalone, it works fine.
21:10  eTiger13: paul_irish:  how much say do you have in chrome dev? any at all? i think the little box at the bottom that shows the site url should move on the opposite side of the mouse instead of the same side
21:11  emanu: I have a page with a excel-style grid on it. I want to use ajax to render that grid on-the-fly as I add columns and sort rows to it. What terms should I be using to learn how to do all the javascript stuff this requires? Rendering ajax partials is giving me mediocre results. Can somebody throw me a bone as to how I could pull this off?
21:14  paul_irish: eTiger13: it does it in dev channel.
