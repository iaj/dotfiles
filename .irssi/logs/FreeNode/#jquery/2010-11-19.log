12:15 @coldhead: i have never had this problem
12:15  maestrojed: so I guess this is a js question not jquery. I am using js to load jquery so js needs to say wait.

12:22  Yuval: Hello, is there anyway I can bind an customized attribute (for example a "flag" boolean) to an element?
12:23  Yuval: I would like to create my own toggle() function with a flag to an element since I need to use .live() and it is not possible with the built in toggle() function
12:23 @coldhead: ?data @ Yuval

12:23  Yuval: awesome
12:24  Xotix: i work with datatables, plugin. i have  a json with 10 entries but i just need to show 1 in my table. do i have to make a table width 10 columns and then hide them or can i say just use the first?
12:24  Yuval: and is there anyway to init this .data() to all elements of a certain kind? (e.g., all <LI>s)
12:24  Xotix: entry
12:25  sean`: yo yo
12:25  sean`: Yuval, ?
12:25  Yuval: ?
12:25  sean`: Yuval, you've got a problem
12:26  Yuval: what
12:26  sean`: Yuval, COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE?
12:26  sean`: Is that better :p
12:26  sean`: You want to init .data?
12:28  Yuval: I create <LI>s dynamically with the jQuery. I want every element that I create to have a default key value of false, i.e. ($currentElem.data('toggleFlag','false);)
12:28  Yuval: Instead of giving them the value everytime, can I have a default value for that key?

12:29  SugaSlide: what would be the best way to turn a <select> into a json string?
12:29  JSM87: This isnt working, any ideas why        $(this).closest('span').text() //// the html is <li><img src="image.jgb"><span>1</span></li> /// $(this) represents img
12:29  SugaSlide: making a jquery tmpl out of select menus lol.. so it would turn select menus to li's
12:30  SugaSlide: JSM87 closest goes UP the dom
12:30  SugaSlide: .find
12:30  JSM87: ok
12:30  SugaSlide: goes down
12:30  JSM87: i'll try find
12:30  SugaSlide: wait..
12:30  SugaSlide: you gonna need
12:30  SugaSlide: $(this).next("span")
12:30  SugaSlide: i think
12:31  SugaSlide: since .find looks inside the tag
12:31  adac: I wAnt to dsable one or more buttons like that: http://pastie.org/1310703 Now firebug complains that val seems to be empty. however alert(val) does show me the string, do its not empty. Any ideas how to solve this?
12:31  SugaSlide: you could go $(this).parent().find("span")
12:31  SugaSlide: but its messy
12:31  JSM87: SugaSlide: .find didnt work
12:32  swe_ET: .closest()
12:32  JSM87: SugaSlide: $(this).parent().find("span") worked
12:32  SugaSlide: JSM87 ?.next
12:32  JSM87: why is it messy?

12:33  chip_r: Hi! I have this plugin $.fn.monthpicker how can I code locale files (monthpicker-en.js, ...) for this plugin?
12:35  Kingsy: anyone in here used tabs.js before? a jquery script for a tab system?
12:35  chip_r: Here the link of the plugin http://www.phpmedia.de/jquery/jquery-plugin-monthpicker/
12:36 @coldhead: hey Kingsy
12:36 @coldhead: most people use the jquery UI tabs
12:36 @coldhead: Kingsy: were you working on a golf supply site?
12:37  Kingsy: coldhead - a long while back, we couldnt find a supplier so it fell through for now
12:38  Kingsy: correction, we couldnt find a reputable supplier :P
12:38 @coldhead: aw nuts
12:39  Kingsy: yup
12:39 @coldhead: i could have had something for you
12:39 @coldhead: what are you working on now?
12:40  Kingsy: coldhead - in the way of a supplier? or something on the technichal side?
12:41 @coldhead: neither, i just could have sent some customers your way
12:41  Kingsy: ah :D, well cheers for thinkin man, I appriciate it
12:41  SugaSlide: is it a way to turn .map into json?
12:41  chip_r: How can i overwrite the defaults options of a plugin?
12:41 @coldhead: chip_r: depends on the plugin
12:42  chip_r: is a $.fn.myfunction plugin
12:42  chip_r: I have found this plugin http://www.phpmedia.de/jquery/jquery-plugin-monthpicker/
12:42 @coldhead: chip_r: the plugin needs to be designed to allow the user to override things
12:42 @coldhead: chip_r: yes, i was just looking at that site but i don't read german
12:42  chip_r: and now  I want to write locale files
12:43 @coldhead: chip_r: could you use jquery UI datepicker instead?
12:43 @coldhead: that probably has better support for localisation
12:43  chip_r: no, I need only the month and year.
12:44 @coldhead: chip_r: i think datepicker is customisable enough to let you do that
12:45  chip_r: yes datepicker is very cool, but for my needs is monthpicker good enough
12:45  Kingsy: looks like I am using a 3rd party script rather than jquery-ui for my tab system.. EEK..

12:49  mathi: hi
12:50  chip_r: coldhead, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/293485/
12:50  mathi: for each request on a specific page, I want to load an external URL. I do this via an iFrame. I am not sure if it is better to add the iFrame dynamically using jQuery after e.g. 2 seconds (the time that the page loads), or to add it immediately in the HTML
12:51  beevi7: hey guys. problem: i have an ajax response with a html document inside
12:52  mathi: can anyone advice ?
12:52  beevi7: success: function(data) {} // data = html
12:52  chip_r: coldhead, but how can i code month-picker-de.js
12:52  beevi7: no i can perfectly get all images using $('img', data);
12:52  chip_r: *monthpicker-de.js
12:52  beevi7: alert($('img', data).length);
12:52  beevi7: says "3"
12:53  beevi7: but $('body', data).length is "0"
12:53  beevi7: although my document definately has a <body>
12:53  beevi7: any idea why√ü
12:53 @coldhead: chip_r: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/293486/
12:54 @coldhead: does that make sense to you?
12:54  mathi: coldhead, can you advice
12:54 @coldhead: mathi: i don't know anything about iframes i am sorry
12:54 @coldhead: its my first day using jquery
12:55  mathi: I thought I saw you here before
12:55  beevi7: is it a bug or is it a feature?
12:55 @coldhead: it has been a long day mathi
12:55  chip_r: coldhead, yes
12:56  mathi: don't lie to me buddy
12:56  Ashfame: I am trying to check two checkboxes if they are checked by this if ( $('legalcheck1').is(':checked') && $('legalcheck2').is(':checked') )
12:56  Ashfame: it always get to the else part
12:56  beevi7: jquery seems to strip out the html, head and body element
12:57  beevi7: weird
12:57 @coldhead: chip_r: it might be better to do $.extend(window.monthpickerlocale, myOpts)
12:57  chip_r: coldhead, here is my code of monthpicker-de.js. But this don't work http://paste.pocoo.org/show/293488/  why???
12:57 @coldhead: so that your options aren't overridden
12:58 @coldhead: you can't access .defaults, chip_r
12:58 @coldhead: its local to the function in the plugin
12:58  chip_r: aha
12:58 @coldhead: you have to do it the way i wrote it
12:58  JSM87: if I have an <li> with 10 images in it, is it possible to get the number of the child (img) I click on using something like eq()
12:58  chip_r: I am very newbie in jquery
12:58  JSM87: so if I clicked the 6th image jquery will return 6
12:58 @coldhead: you'll do fine, chip_r
12:58 @coldhead: i am new too
12:59 @coldhead: ?index @ JSM87
12:59  bot-t: JSM87, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
12:59 @coldhead: ignore the description, index() does what you want in recent jquery versions, JSM87
12:59  chip_r: can I change the plugin itself? So that accepts ah locale
12:59 @coldhead: go ahead, chip_r
13:00 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
13:00  chip_r: for example ui-multiselect has a nice locale file
13:00  JSM87: coldhead: so would this return the number  ... $(this).index() with  this being img
13:01  chip_r: ?
13:01 @coldhead: actually, JSM87
13:01 @coldhead: if the img is in an li
13:01 @coldhead: you probably want $(this).parent().index()
13:01  JSM87: coldhead: it is in an li
13:01 @coldhead: but yet
13:01 @coldhead: yes*
13:01 @coldhead: it works on siblings
13:01 @coldhead: so it will give you 3 for the 4th li
13:02  JSM87: coldhead: it just returns -1
13:02 @coldhead: ?p @ JSM87
13:02  bot-t: JSM87, Paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net , http://paste.pocoo.org/+js , or http://fixee.org
13:02 @coldhead: chip_r: you should copy that then, and send it to the authors!
13:02 @coldhead: they would probably be glad to make their plugin multilingual
13:02  JSM87: coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/FNdVF/
13:03 @coldhead: JSM87: can you paste the html?
13:04  JSM87: coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/FNdVF/1/
13:05 @coldhead: JSM87: http://jsfiddle.net/FNdVF/2/
13:05 @coldhead: you see it works there
13:05 @coldhead: JSM87: where the fuck is the li?
13:05  JSM87: oh sorry its not an li
13:05 @coldhead: if you just want the index of the img, just use $(this).index()
13:06  JSM87: It was on another page ah
13:06 @coldhead: and if you're trying to get the index of something that spans multiple branches of the dom
13:06  JSM87: How can it be done with <div> and <img>
13:06 @coldhead: good luck with that :)
13:06 @coldhead: $(this).index() will give you the index of the image
13:06 @coldhead: so 2 for /static/images/design/plans-green-postit.jpg
13:06 @coldhead: capiche?
13:07  JSM87: coldhead: it just gives -1
13:07 @coldhead: what jquery version are you using?
13:07 @coldhead: did you see my example where it works?
13:08 @coldhead: JSM87: the old way to do it, without index, is $(this).prevAll().length
13:08 @coldhead: but if you do it that way you have to put a shoutout comment to temp01 and redsquare
13:08  JSM87: coldhead: $(this).prevAll().length worked
13:08 @coldhead: or you'll be cursed
13:09  JSM87: Im assuming to get the actual number you have to do +1 ?
13:09  JSM87: is that the correct way tpo do it
13:09 @coldhead: yes
13:09  JSM87: ok
13:09 @coldhead: it counts from 0
13:09  JSM87: cheers
13:09 @coldhead: you better add // Thanks temp01 and redsquare!!
13:09 @coldhead: i mean it!
13:09 @coldhead: a terrible gypsy curse
13:10  chip_r: coldhead, yuuuuppppppyyyy I have found the solution
13:11  JSM87: coldhead: where are they
13:11 @coldhead: JSM87: they invented the prevAll() hack
13:11  blindchild: can you give a variable name a php value?
13:11 @coldhead: chip_r: good going!
13:11  denysonique: blindchild, ?
13:12 @coldhead: blindchild: you can if your JS is generated by PHP
13:12  blindchild: hi...umm...
13:12 @coldhead: var x = <?= $phpvar ?>;
13:12 @coldhead: or um var <?= $trololol ?> = 7;
13:12 @coldhead: if that's what you meant
13:12 @coldhead: you weirdo
13:12  blindchild: yahs the second one...
13:12  blindchild: ha
13:12  denysonique: blindchild, as long as the file is .php
13:13  blindchild: so var <?= $trololol ?> = 7; will work?
13:13  blindchild: ok im on it!
13:13  blindchild: it wasnt working so maybe i am doing something wrong...
13:13 @coldhead: it won't work in a .js file
13:13  denysonique: blindchild, it will echo $troltrol to js
13:13  denysonique: anyway
13:13  blindchild: eh?
13:13 @coldhead: it will work if you have <script> etc <? ?> in your .php
13:13  denysonique: let him test, he will learn this way
13:13 @coldhead: amen denysonique
13:14  blindchild: pieces of cake be with you
13:14  denysonique: and also with you.
13:14  blindchild: actually sorry one last mini question
13:14  blindchild: is the php value is a number...
13:15 @coldhead: no can has
13:15  denysonique: rotfl
13:15  blindchild: how can i get something like var x_37 = 273
13:15 @coldhead: js vars can't start with a digit
13:15 @coldhead: that would be okay
13:15  chip_r: coldhead,  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/293493/
13:15 @coldhead: it sounds like you're doing something terrible blindchild
13:15 @coldhead: good luck with that
13:16  blindchild: how do i do a combo name... just var x_<?= $trololol ?> = 7;
13:16 @coldhead: that's really nice, chip_r
13:16 @coldhead: good work
13:16 @coldhead: be sure to send that to the plugin authors!
13:16  blindchild: i have no idea what im doing...im doing it anywyas...as long as it works...
13:16  denysonique: blindchild, instead of var x_foo you could use arrays or objects
13:16  fmathews: question: is it by intention that something like $(obj).closest('div img') would fail where using a function in closest to filter would work? curious if this is a bug or intended behaviour. docs don't seem to cover it
13:17  denysonique: blindchild, e.g. variable.<?=$trololol?> = 7
13:17  blindchild: denysonique i see i see, ok i will try that also...
13:17 @coldhead: can you do a testcase, fmathews?
13:17 @coldhead: sounds juicy
13:17  blindchild: imma have a play...
13:17 @coldhead: people will wanna see
13:17  Kingsy: does jsfiddle.net have ui has a framework to select?
13:18 @coldhead: Kingsy: i believe so
13:18  Kingsy: hmm I cant see it
13:18 @coldhead: my friends, it is time for me to slip into unconsciousness. i bid you all happy hacking and goodnight
13:18  fmathews: I suppose I can, I've just never had closest() work with a cascading selector

13:26  philk_: how do I replace a tbody in a table? I have a fixed thead that should not be changed, but want to exchange the whole tbody at once
13:27  philk_: is there something like .replaceOrAppend('tbody')?
13:28  JSM87: I have this which returns a number // $(this).prevAll().length // the problem is if I add +1 after it it will turn 0 into 01 for instance, 1 into 11. Ive tried wrapping it around parsInt would that didnt work
13:31  MukkeLazy: i do a $.getJSON like every sec to update some data, but sometimes the previous requst is like 700ms while the next is 200ms, so first i will show the 2nd request data and then the slower data which is older
13:31  MukkeLazy: i can set timeout on like 500ms but not sure if that is the best solution
13:31  nlogax: Kingsy: select jquery, then check the box that says UI something
13:32  Kingsy: ah yea got it
13:32  MukkeLazy: or should i set the setTimeout  in the callback function ?
13:32  Kingsy: nlogax - if I am creating a tab system using jquery ui, and I don't want the theming that comes with it, how do I specify in the $("#tabs").tabs(); call not to theme the tabs?
13:33  Kingsy: can you give tabs() a parameter for that?
13:33  nlogax: Kingsy: just don't include the CSS, or customize it
13:33  owzzz: Hi guys im using fancy box to load images and videos.. the title has a link on each of the images..

14:11  Kingsy: does anyone have an indented version of jquery ui?
14:12  Cork: Kingsy: "intented version"?
14:12  Cork: you mean an uncompressed version?
14:12  Kingsy: heh yea, or I need two seperate js files, one for tabs unthemed and one for price slider themed
14:13  Kingsy: Cork: is it possible to get those rom somewhere?
14:13  Kingsy: from*
14:13  Cork: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/11/jquery-ui-1-8-6/
14:16  Kingsy: just curious, why are jquery libs compressed anyway? what is the point? it doesnt effect execution time having spaces
14:16  sander_m_: Kingsy: It affects download time
14:16  mkc: file transfer time. You want the files to be as small as possible
14:17  Jarda: sander_m_: just start using it

14:17  sander_m_: Jarda: But if I use $(document).ready it will override the existing window.onload, right?
14:17  Jarda: sander_m_: it won't, afaik
14:18  sander_m_: Jarda: Great. That's news to me.
14:18  Jarda: I'm not 100% certain
14:18  Jarda: but most likely it won't
14:18  sander_m_: Kingsy: Just compare the file sizes of the compressed and uncompressen version
14:18  sander_m_: Jarda: I'll try then.
14:19  mkc: so for every 1GB or bandwidth you can be using 100MB. If you have all unique users accessing the side
14:19  mkc: site
14:20  mkc: granted you have like a billion users or whatever
14:21  Do``: i'm looking for a way to efficiently "watch" an entire html document for changes. short of adding a livequery to *, does anybody have any ideas?
14:22  Do``: perhaps some event that gets called by the browser?
14:25  sean`: fuck
14:25  sean`: I need to validate a piece of a form, but not send it
14:28  mkc: Do``: i found this. Not sure if this helps. http://www.vsisystems.com/websitechangemonitor.htm
14:28  Do``: mkc: i was thinking about javascript. this would be used in a jquery plugin
14:28  Do``: not about an rss feed :)
14:29  Kingsy: ok this is impossible to stop the theming by hand.. its really hacky. is it possible to get two min.js ui files? one for the slider themed. one for the tabs unthemed?
14:29  mkc: yea. that is a nice problem to know an answer to. The only other option that comes to mind is to traverse the dom and check for changes, but that seems pretty performance intensive
14:30  Woet: Is there an easy way to disable the selection of history in the datepicker?
14:30  Woet: E.g, only allow the 20th of november and onwards
14:33  Do``: mkc: that's precisely what i meant by "livequery to *"
14:36  mkc: did you look at DOMSubtreeModified
14:37  Danny_Joris: Hi all, I tried to fix this the entire evening, but I can't get the accordion to work on in the left sidebar: http://infopuntbrugge-staging.dotprojects.be/communities
14:39  Danny_Joris: I believe all the correct js files are loaded . jquery, jquery ui and the accordion file
14:39  Danny_Joris: I have the same structure as explained here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#default
14:39  Danny_Joris: it adds some spans and classes, but not much more than that...
14:40  Kingsy: oh ffs, the difference between a themed and non-themed jquery ui lib is that the css isnt included
14:41  Kingsy: what happens if you don't want jquery to litter the classnames like it does?
14:43  joelmccracken: is there an easy way to change one element type to another, e.g. convert an <a> to a <span> ?

14:49  joelmccracken: hmm. that may work
14:49  jxpx777: joelmccracken: note that the matched set can be a new HTML string
14:50  joelmccracken: i was ideally looking for just replacing the element type, e.g. i want to save the attributes
14:50  joelmccracken: but w/e, this should work

15:01  snoy_ms: Hey there. I have a question about how the better way to solve a fullscreen gallery. At first two Example:
15:01  snoy_ms: http://www.thisiscollate.com/ (they used scrollto)
15:01  snoy_ms: http://www.mavic.com/de they used simple animation
15:02  snoy_ms: whats the better way ?
15:02  snoy_ms: the question is. Better scroll the "view" or animate the content ?
15:04  Zeu5: hi there, i want to get everything inside this div http://jsfiddle.net/26x2J/ including the <script ... i used .html() which only retrieved the html portion but not the script portion. please advise

15:10  peterPan-: Hey, I need some debugging help. I got these to versions: http://dotnet.johanneshiemer.de/dp-withjqval.htm and http://dotnet.johanneshiemer.de/dp-withoutjqval.htm one, with jquery.validate.js included and the other not. as you can see, when you select a date, the formatting is corrupted. How do I get the source of the problem?
15:11  mr_mustard: could someone take a look: http://pastebin.com/HWNCCMh2
15:11  Zeu5: mekwall: how do i retrieve everything including the script portion?
15:12  mekwall: Zeu5, rename the script tag to something else? :)
15:12  Zeu5: mekwall: what do you mean by rename the script tag to something else?
15:12  mekwall: Zeu5, but really... you shouldn't send javascript like that
15:13  mekwall: Zeu5, put the js inside a div-tag instead and then change it into a script once you've loaded it
15:13  Zeu5: mekwall: i am not sending. i jus want to use jquery to take the script and change the id and use it for another element
15:14  mekwall: Zeu5, oh... sry, I misunderstood :P
15:14  joelmccracken: hey guys, is anyone here using jasmine for javascript bdd?
15:14  Zeu5: mekwall: its all right. :) any suggestions?
15:14  mekwall: Zeu5, but now I'm wondering... why aren't you making that into a function?
15:14  mekwall: so you can call it again, with another id?
15:14  Zeu5: i see your point. let me go try
15:14  ragefuljoe: morning
15:15  ragefuljoe: anyone awake
15:15  philk_: why does $hide_result_editor[0].disabled = true; works and disables the style element but $hide_result_editor.attr('disabled', 'true'); does not disable the style element?
15:15  mekwall: Zeu5, even better is if you use a class and then just use the bind on all the elements with that class
15:16  sean`: guys

15:16  diamonds: but it's packaged with 1.1.2
15:16  diamonds: does anyone know this "jquery css dock menu" project and whether anyone has followed up on it?  I searched github to no avail...
15:17  ragefuljoe: can anyone recommend the best method to implement a simple dictionary?
15:17  mekwall: sean`, that's just wonderful!

15:19  diamonds: I'll keep looking
15:19  erichynds: plus it's not really CSS when it relies on jquery for its functionality
15:20  Xotix: how can i set the value of a div with jquery??
15:20  diamonds: erichynds: I agree :) I am also vexed by people calling stuff "css3" when it's javascript

15:21  Xotix: isnt there something like $("#hiddenInput").value = xzy?
15:21  erichynds: .val()
15:21  erichynds: but you want text() or html() for a div
15:22  Xotix: yctually its an input and val doesnt work for setting it. same workds with plain js.
15:23  erichynds: then ur doin it wrong
15:23  erichynds: $("input").val("foo")

15:40  wip: hi everyone, i am trying to use jquery-ui autocomplete but i need the remote data to be filter not only with the input text but also depending on another droplist to narrow the results?
15:40  rufus2021: but he actually paid for love in that movie
15:40  rufus2021: you just proved doonie's point
15:40  doonie: serio actually seen it, still nothin heh
15:41  doonie: also its just a moooovie
15:41  doonie: having money gives you time to love each other, no money gives you time to worry about not having money ;>
15:41  adoven: wip: you need to override the filter function for autocomplete
15:41  rufus2021: now this is a movie - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097790/
15:42  doonie: heh
15:42  wip: adoven: oh ok, will read about it
15:42  doonie: or pretty woman ;P
15:43  adoven: wip: if you look at the autocomplete source, theres a part thats like $.extend( $.ui.autocomplete, { escapeREgex: function, filter: function }
15:43  wip: adoven: have you ever implement this, if yes do you have a link?
15:43  doonie: well time to call it for today. off to lie down and think about money ;p later folks
15:43  mekwall: doonie, worrying about money is stupid...

15:44 * wip is lucky today :)
15:44  Brodingo: he has to go worry, you heard him
15:44  cambazz: why this does not work: -> $.each(target.children(), function(i,v) { v.remove(); });
15:45  cambazz: i want to iterate the children of an element, then remove them, selectively of course. the above example is over simplified.
15:45  wip: adoven: oh a bit complex :)

16:06  owzzz: when I tab through the top nav it drops down..
16:06  owzzz: but when I tab again to go through the links in that drop down.. it closes..
16:07  rimantas: Xotix, which version of jQuery are you using?
16:07  Xotix: 1.4.2
16:08  rimantas: get 1.4.4, it deals with width of hidden elements correctly
16:08  Zeu5: can i bind a newly created element to a click function in jquery?
16:08  Zeu5: i seem not to be able to do it.
16:09  owzzz: how can I check if an element is inside another element?
16:09  rufus2021: yes, you can use .live()
16:10  Xotix: okay
16:10  jxpx777: owzzz: you mean if it has a parent or if it's parent is a particular element?
16:11  rimantas: Xotix, from releae notes for 1.4.4: (Enh) .width() and .height() now report the width and height of hidden elements (#7225)
16:11  Xotix: ok thanks
16:14 --- gregglind_away is now known as gregglind
16:14  Xotix: hmm seems its me whose failing ^^
16:14  gregglind: me: planning to use jQuery.ui, themeroller, would like some suggestions about good plugins for forms. any consensus choices?

16:29  henrikkok: martinchristov: you can only use the selectors if you have some valid DOM
16:29  JSM87: fmathews: whats is <![CDATA
16:29  JSM87: Ive seen it but what is its purpose

16:46  ririto: hi guys
16:46  Hopsy: does javascript uses enum?
16:46  jxpx777: owzzz: Right. So, you need to $('#mainnav').find(this) or something like that.
16:47  Hopsy: i cant see an example at wikipedia
16:47  jxpx777: Hopsy: enum like in C?
16:47  owzzz: o.k..
16:47  owzzz: will try it thanls
16:47  Hopsy: jxpx777: yes i think
16:47  Hoe``: no enums, but you can make a namespace style object
16:47  Hopsy: do we have more enums =p
16:47  Brodingo: ugh

16:50  jxpx777: lol
16:50  Hopsy: jxpx777: so an enum is a repeat thing?
16:50  Hopsy: a for loop?
16:50  jxpx777: Hopsy: No, enum != enumeration. That's what I was trying to clarify from your question

16:54  gregglind: so, no thoughts on really good form plugins, or ones people here use regularly?
16:54  jxpx777: Hopsy: enum is indeed an enumerated type, but enumeration is the process of iterating over a collection
16:54  Xotix: http://programming.top54u.com/Samples/Javascript/Javascript-Basics/JavaScript-Enum/Default.aspx
16:54  Hopsy: wikipedia gives this example
16:54  serio: gregglind, just use ?see ajaxForm
16:54  Hopsy: For example, the four suits in a deck of playing cards may be four enumerators named CLUB, DIAMOND, HEART, SPADE, belonging to an enumerated type named suit

16:55  philk_: how can I find out the index() of en element among like this elem.index('[data-reinspection]') ? there are 3 such elements and I would expect it return 1 instead of -1
16:56  jxpx777: Hopsy: Xotix's link is good. So, enum is not a type in js, but you can easily mimic it
16:56  gregglind: All right, thanks serio, bot-t. do people like Validate for validation?  (this is non-mission critical, fun, so there is no 'server backend' really)
16:56  serio: you should always validate on the backend
16:56  serio: ALWAYS
16:57  Hopsy: isnt that the same as, var card = {'first':'club', 'second': 'diamond', 'third': 'heart', 'fourth':'spade'};
16:57  gregglind: serio, I appreciate the solidity, doesn't apply here, *really*, trust me.
16:57  Hopsy: owh
16:57  jxpx777: gregglind: Depending on your needs, HTML5 elements might supply enough validation like for email types
16:57  serio: I'm not sure what the best front-end form validation script is.
16:57  serio: I'm sure there are several.
16:57  Hopsy: :O was the same example
16:57  Hopsy: well done Xotix
16:58  jxpx777: Hopsy: Well, then that wouldn't be an enum. enum members equate to integer values
16:58  gregglind: I will look into them, and keep the advice about validating on *both sides* in mind :)

19:07  denysonique: Cork[home], not every site uses https?
19:07  denysonique: s/\?//
19:07  denysonique: Cork[home], btw an https CDN should work
19:07  ajpiano: denysonique: you know that that is an unanswerable question
19:07  Cork[home]: ya, sure, but they might use a framework that is built to handle it
19:08  ajpiano: some people prefer knowing they have control of all the assets on the server
19:08  ajpiano: other people probably don't know about the CDN

19:12  philk__: ajpiano: according to this site http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2009/05/7/jquery-edge-versatile-index you created the new index function for 1.4.4 :) So you should have some insight about it. Maybe it does not work with a attribute selector?
19:12  Edler: i just want to know which one is the best to use
19:12  Cork[home]: ragefuljoe: the word in the list should slide left?
19:12  Cork[home]: thats alot harder...

19:42  sonoprontosonoqu: i need to find the textnode, and edit it

19:42  sonoprontosonoqu: tried with contents().eq(0).wrap('<p />')
19:42  sonoprontosonoqu: but i'm not very familiar with jquery
19:42  sonoprontosonoqu: the text to be added is the letter of a keystroke

19:42  sac: sonoprontosonoqu, not really an answer for your question, but it's usually simple solution to put that text in a span
19:42  sac: but that's an answer to your question :)
19:42  topher: how can i add an additional selection onto a set? e.g. i have $("div#main form") but i really need $("div#main form input"), except i have to add that last input selector later, so to speak. i think this is a basic question
19:42  ben_alman: ajpiano is replaceText the most-recommended plugin in here?

19:43  ragefuljoe: hmm.
19:43  danheberden: i'd put bbq as the top, ben_alman
19:43  ragefuljoe: when I try to use .toggle(200)
19:43  ragefuljoe: it doesnt toggle
19:43  ragefuljoe: but .toggle() works fine
19:44  ajpiano: sonoprontosonoqu: writing a little less html to save bandwidth and then adding lots of client side processing
19:44  ajpiano: isn't...
19:44  ajpiano: the best idea
19:44  danheberden: sonoprontosonoqu: might want to add some html and get rid of, like half of that js
19:44  sonoprontosonoqu: i'm a newbie :)
19:44  jacobolus: and also, how do I get at the value of a jQuery UI slider from outside it?
19:45  sonoprontosonoqu: ajpiano, danh, you're probably right
19:45  sonoprontosonoqu: will do that
19:45  ajpiano: jacobolus, call the value method
19:45  ajpiano: $("#elem").slider("value")
19:45  sonoprontosonoqu: thought there was an easy way of handling textnodes with selectors
19:45  ajpiano: nope
19:45  jacobolus: ajpiano: even if I already had called .slider() to create it?
19:45  jacobolus: ajpiano: okay
19:46  jacobolus: ajpiano: and how do I trigger the slide event?
19:46  danheberden: sonoprontosonoqu: contents is the only way, but then issues of what browsers consider text nodes and ya, it's messy
19:46  ajpiano: you don't need to trigger the slide event to get the value
19:46  jacobolus: I know
19:46  jacobolus: I want to trigger a slide event also though
19:46  sonoprontosonoqu: dan: thx for the tip
19:46  danheberden: .trigger('slide')
19:46  jacobolus: thanks!
19:46  danheberden: its on the help docs
19:47  danheberden: (the names of the events)

19:50  rundumbdog: $.post( '/url/', poststr, function(data){ $('#div').html(data) }); --> ajax page has $(this).html('Change it back!');

19:54  jacobolus: that'll trigger slide?
19:54  delinquentme: ok BETTER question ... is there a more effective way to toggle between two CSS values than what ive done in line 20 of http://pastie.org/1311525
19:54  danheberden: jacobolus: slidechange
19:54  danheberden: or should, if memeory serves me right
19:54  danheberden: or change the val, then trigger slide

19:55  ben_alman: delinquentme jQuery.fn.moveCarousel - you're not doing this right
19:55  bbtech: Does url look for the file in the root or current directory? $.ajax({url: "file.php",...
19:56  ben_alman: man i really need to make my idiomatic jquery talk into an article.
19:56  serio: haha
19:56  serio: yes, you do
19:57  danheberden: bbtech: just like a href - a relative url based from where you are
19:57  delinquentme: ben_alman, teach me!
19:57  danheberden: '/folder/whatever.php' is your html root
19:57  danheberden: 'folder/whatever.php' is relative to where you are
19:58  delinquentme: ben_alman, the toggle is structured correctly though .. maybe?
19:58  ben_alman: yeah the toggle itself is ok
19:58  ben_alman: but your jQuery.fn.whatever method isn't chainable
19:58  jacobolus: danheberden: okay, supposedly changing the value programmatically triggers 'slidechange'
19:59  sonoprontosonoqu: same with './folder/whatever.php' (dot at the beginning)
19:59  rundumbdog: whats the other one.. setinterval
19:59  jacobolus: danheberden: so to do that I want elem.slider('value', newval) ?
19:59  ben_alman: replace "$(this)" with "return this"
19:59  rundumbdog: not clearinval
19:59  rundumbdog: but the other interval set
19:59  rundumbdog: settimeout
19:59  ajpiano: setTimeout ?
19:59  bbtech: danheberden: ok, thanks!
20:00  ben_alman: delinquentme why not put all those elements into a single container, and then just toggle the container?
20:00  rundumbdog: setTimeout(window.location.reload(true), 20)0;
20:00  rundumbdog: ^ incorrect
20:00  ben_alman: or add a class to the parent, and then based on that class, hide the necessary elements via CSS
20:00  delinquentme: ben_alman, im a little short of a jquery hacker .. so whichever method you think is more effective ..?
20:01  ben_alman: delinquentme for simple toggling, i'd literally toggle by doing: $(parentelement).toggleClass( "whatever" );
20:01  ben_alman: and then in your CSS to all that hiding / showing / positioning based on that class existing or not
20:01  ben_alman: it'll be super fast
20:01  JenniferB2: ben_alman: what are your trying do... i just got a bit curious
20:01  ben_alman: and easy
20:02  ben_alman: because all you need to do is change one single class on one single element
20:02  delinquentme: the toggleClass has me confused
20:02  ben_alman: and the CSS will do all the display stuff
20:02  ben_alman: ? toggleClass @ delinquentme
20:02  bot-t: delinquentme, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
20:02  delinquentme: is .toggleClass a jquery definied function?
20:02  delinquentme:  oh!
20:03  delinquentme: hmm though straight up .toggle() has the hide show integrated .. which keeps the css clean
20:04  delinquentme: ben_alman,  what was that "return_this" technique u were talking about?  .. was this inside the function .. or in the function call?
20:06  jacobolus: hmm this still isn't working; I can't actually get any events triggering from outside the slider
20:07  ben_alman: delinquentme http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/DZD2d/
20:07  ben_alman: click the link
20:07  ben_alman: see how simple the javascript is, and what the CSS is doing?
20:07  ben_alman: super-simple = awesome
20:07  jacobolus: if I do $('#element').trigger('slide') or if I do $('#element').trigger('change') I get the jQuery object returned, but the events don't seem to fire
20:07  ajpiano: ben_alman, i'm gonna need to step up and disagree w/ you there

21:40  ragefuljoe: is this correct> $words.find('div').not(this).hide()
21:40  ajpiano: dilvie: i donno
21:41  ragefuljoe: and nope
21:41  ajpiano: it just feels silly to me
21:41  ragefuljoe: lol
21:41  ajpiano: like, the first time that was pointed out to me i was like, that is definitely not somehting i ever want to do again
21:41  ajpiano: is all
21:41  erichynds: ragefuljoe, prolly not
21:41  ragefuljoe: lol
21:41  erichynds: what is "this"
21:41  erichynds: what is $words
21:41  ragefuljoe: words is var holding all the <li> <div> pairs
21:41  Guest89897: please people
21:42  Guest89897: http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/7499/sanstitredem.png
21:42  ragefuljoe: and the click function is called on <li>
21:42 --- Lindrian is now known as notLindrian
21:42  ragefuljoe: so in this instance this would be the calling li
21:42  Guest89897: how can i take that responst and use it ?
21:42  ajpiano: ?jQuery.parseJSON @ Guest89897
21:42  bot-t: Guest89897, jQuery.parseJSON(json): [New in v1.4.1] Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
21:42  ajpiano: Guest89897, we all appreciate the amount of effort you put into looking this up on the internet before coming here to ask
21:42  ajpiano: it really shows
21:42  ajpiano: that you did your due diligence
21:42  erichynds: lawl
21:42  dilvie: ajpiano: Definitely worth thinking about. =)
21:42  ajpiano: and respect everyone's time

21:43  serio: this is sarcasm right?
21:43  ajpiano: serio, no man, i'm bein really earnest
21:43  serio: OK, wasn't sure.
21:44  Guest89897: doesn't parseJSON do the opposite ?
21:44  erichynds: ragefuljoe, is .words the li?
21:44  Guest89897: take a JS object and write it into json ?
21:44  ajpiano: nope
21:44  serio: Guest15399, no sir
21:44  ajpiano: that's what see ?stringify does
21:44  bot-t: JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (http://json.org/json2.js) to provide a fallback. jQuery does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
21:44  serio: converts your js into a usable js object :)
21:44 --- notLindrian is now known as Lindrian
21:44  serio: er, json, rather
21:44  erichynds: ragefuljoe, pastie an html structure to go along with that

21:50  ragefuljoe: im looking at inspector
21:51  Muimi: when you go back into the div, it's like you're click-holding the slider?

21:52  serio: and your imaginary problem is solved.
21:52 --- ilpoldo_ is now known as ilpoldo
21:53  jsprty__: when using <label>'s with corresponding radio buttons, I noticed when clicking on a label, the corresponding radio button is selected after the click event--is there a way to register the selection within the click event?
21:54  jsprty__: if that makes sense...
21:57  Woelfle: hey guys, I'm moving a <div> in the DOM tree with .append() and right now I'm trying to animate this very aciton
21:57 --- ilpoldo_ is now known as ilpoldo
21:58  Woelfle: it would've been quite easy if I could work with absolute positions, but I can't, because both the old and the new parent element have position: relative
21:58  erichynds: jsprty__, that's a browser thing
21:59  jsprty__: oh yeah?
21:59  jsprty__: damn
21:59  Muimi: serio, I didn't think it was a problem really.  I just wondered why it was made that way.
21:59  Muimi: Maybe an issue.  I guess it could be a problem for someone, sometime, somehow.
21:59  jsprty__: well, my goal here is to submit the form upon clicking of the radio's corresponding <label>
22:00  jsprty__: and my approach was to attach a click handler to the label, which in turn submits the form
22:00  erichynds: jsprty__, in the link's click handler, $(this.form).submit()
22:00  jsprty__: yes, the submission part works, however, the radio button are not updated until after the click handler
22:01  jsprty__: if you know what I mean
22:01  jsprty__: (which you said was a browser thing?)
22:01  erichynds: um
22:01  erichynds: i think i opened a bug for that actually lol
22:01  erichynds: 1 sec
22:01  Danny_Joris: Hi all, I need to check if the next tag next to the h3 is a div or not. How can I do this? if ($('#accordion h3').next() ){
22:02  jsprty__: e.g., (o)Option1   ( )Option2   <--- upon clicking Option2, inside the click fn, the form sends Option1 as being selected  (so we're on the same page here?)
22:05  erichynds: jsprty__, works here http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/UzJ4X/
22:06  erichynds: jsprty__, you could also try changing your click event to a mouseup event
22:06  ragefuljoe: wtf now toggle() isnt working at all
22:06  jsprty__: ok, thanks, let me try a couple of ideas there
22:07  danheberden: ragefuljoe: there has been a national .toggle outage today
22:08  ragefuljoe: werd
22:08  ragefuljoe: at least not a pr0n outage
22:08  ragefuljoe: there would be chaos

22:15 --- Channel #jquery was synced in 84 seconds
22:15  jsprty__: erichynds: that works because the click event is on the radio input itself; but I want the click event to be on the text label, and when clicking <labels>, the update occurs after the click, apparently
22:16  erichynds: mstef, nothing that is widely supported
22:16  mstef: erichynds: ah..got anything that isn't widely supported?
22:16  erichynds: jsprty__, but clicking the label fires the radio's click event
22:16  erichynds: mstef, livequery i guess
22:16  jsprty__: ohh, I gotcha
22:17  ronnie_vd_c: Update, included the Bool initiator: http://pastebin.com/KFsfFnSR
22:18  mstef: erichynds: basically there's another JS script that inserts a dialog inside the DOM whenever X happens..i want another jquery script to alter some of the content inside there
22:18  erichynds: mstef, alter the content at the point where X happens
22:18  erichynds: in that event handler
22:18  erichynds: whereever it may be
22:19 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
22:19  mstef: erichynds: it's a click on a certain button..i can attach to it but i don't think the loaded dialog will be ready the second it's clicked
22:19  erichynds: are you using ajax?
22:19  Bjornet: I try again, I wonder if you could help me out on this one:
22:19  Bjornet: http://pastebin.com/qTdh2g7s
22:20  dabear: ?g dom manipulatio events @ erichynds
22:20  bot-t: erichynds, Manipulation ‚Äì jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
22:20  erichynds: ?
22:20  mstef: erichynds: it's a ckeditor plugin
22:20  mstef: but i can't alter it directly
22:20  dabear: @mstef sry
22:20  Bjornet: I cant figure out how to fire of a simple .css() after that the preloader is done..
22:21  erichynds: mstef, is the content being loaded via ajax though?  or just DOM manipulation?
22:21  mstef: erichynds: i believe it's just DOM manipulation
22:22  mstef: erichynds: maybe i can try to attach to the button click...i don't know the order or execution in jquery though
22:22  erichynds: mstef, does the plugin have a callback you can hook into?
22:22  mstef: erichynds: unfortuntately..no
22:22  erichynds: bummer.

22:23  pif: what is the ie detection function in jq?
22:24  dabear: DOMNodeInserted, mstef
22:24  Danny_Joris: How can you negate this if statement? if ($(this).next().is('h3')) $(this).addClass('noheader');
22:24  mstef: dabear: that's an event?
22:24  dabear: ?jquery browser @ pif
22:24  bot-t: pif, jQuery.browser: We recommend against using this property, please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support).

22:24  Danny_Joris: this .is should work as .is not
22:24  dabear: mstef: yeah
22:24  dabear: but don't use it
22:24  mstef: dabear: hah why
22:24  erichynds: lol...
22:24  dabear: not widely supported
22:24  mstef: ah
22:24  mstef: that sucks
22:24  erichynds: livequery if you must, mstef
22:24  dabear: slows down document
22:25  mstef: let me see what i can do...thanks erichynds dabear
22:26  ronnie_vd_c: Bjornet: i think this will work (not tested) http://pastebin.com/bW1pgidy
22:28  erichynds: i think domnodeinserted is deprecated anyway
22:30 --- jrphelps is now known as jxpx777
22:31  Bjornet: ronnie_vd_c: img.onload is not a function firebug gives me..
22:31  dabear: erichynds: that is true
22:31  dabear: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-mutationevents
22:31  topher: is there an or operator in the selector? e.g. $("div#main form (input OR select)") ?
22:31  dabear: but deprecating sometihng before the replacement is finished, is silly :/
22:31  dabear: topher: nope
22:32  topher: dabear: i should just run jquery twice and keep separate results?
22:32  dabear: $("#main form").find("input, select")
22:32  topher: ah
22:32  dabear: $("#main form input, #main form select")
22:32  topher: oh right
22:32  topher: i shouldve known that last one
22:32  dabear: choose one
22:32  topher: dabear: thank you
22:32  Bjornet: When I look at the script you wrote it looks logical to me. But Im much to much a newbe to understand firebug and what it mean
22:34  GarryFre: The letters T and G are very close to each other on a keyboard. This recently became all too apparent to me and consequently I will never be ending a work email with the phrase "Regards" again.

22:35  dabear: GarryFre: you retard
22:35  linelevel: What's the best way to bind an event to a button in a jQuery UI dialog? I tried doing it in $(document).ready() but it didn't work because (I believe) the dialog isn't present in the DOM until I open it.
22:35  jsprty__: erichynds: I've got it working nicely now, thanks for helping me "see the light" :)
22:35  erichynds: cool
22:35  dabear: linelevel: see ?delegate

22:35  erichynds: jsprty__, how did you fix?
22:35  dabear: or see ?live
22:35  bot-t: .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
22:36  jsprty__: I attached the form submission in the click event to the radio input, not the click event of the label
22:36  jsprty__: and like you mentioned, clicking the label fires off the input's click event
22:37  ronnie_vd_c: Bjornet: hmm strange. thought that img.onload was right. maybe there is an $ alternative?
22:37  Bjornet: hmm maby
22:37  mstef: is there a better way to print out a JS object other than firebug?
22:37  Bjornet: so you thought that img.onload was a pure javaScript function?
22:37  jxpx777: mstef: alert()?
22:37  jxpx777: :P
22:37  mstef: haha no this is gigantic
22:38  Bjornet: well tnx anyway
22:38  erichynds: you can try webkit inspector
22:38  erichynds: although i prefer firebug
22:39  gnarf: mstef: JSON.stringify() ?
22:40  dabear: mstef: console.dir(yourObj) is great
22:40  gnarf: although console.dir() from FB is prolly the best
22:40  ronnie_vd_c: Bjornet: have a look at this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images
22:40  mstef: dabear: i'll try that thanks
22:40 --- sodhi is now known as Guest14060
22:40  ronnie_vd_c: i have not much time to solve the puzzle myself atm
22:41  gnarf: if you want something for non-Firebug situations, stringify / append to a div works pretty well
22:41  erichynds: only if you're leet, alert($.param(obj));
22:41  erichynds: a JS obj isn't json

22:44  Hopsy: jeremyw: SugaSlide asked me to ask you if you was a virgin
22:44  Hopsy: omg
22:44  thepacmanfan: erichynds: like $("#slider-parent #slider-child")
22:44  Hopsy: jeremyw: so whats your answer ?
22:45  erichynds: thepacmanfan, if it's an ID there's no point in specifying a cascade
22:45  Hopsy: [22:44:46] <SugaSlide> im slightly wasted
22:46  thepacmanfan: erichynds: i know what you're saying, but i have bad practice elsewhere, thus it could be a problem anyway.
22:46  erichynds: thepacmanfan, well, that's how you do a cascade - jquery accepts CSS selectors
22:46  thepacmanfan: erichynds: not on the same page, but i only want this code to run on one page of the site.
22:46  thepacmanfan: ok, thanks!
22:47  jeremyw: Wow...
22:48  thepacmanfan: so, are you? :D
22:48  ckb: if I have a jQuery object with 10 elements in it, how can I randomly execute a function on each of them subsequently but not repeat?
22:48  SugaSlide: hmmmmmmmmmmm
22:48  SugaSlide: not me
22:48  jeremyw: No, I've got two kids.  I just never expected being asked here...maybe in ##mac.
22:48  erichynds: randomly execute sequentially?
22:49  SugaSlide: i didnt do it
22:49  ckb: erichynds: it would be easier if I showed you an example with source
22:49  SugaSlide: i think
22:49  ckb: so give me 2 seconds
22:49  SugaSlide: hopsy wtf's goin on?
22:49  Hopsy: whut?
22:49  thepacmanfan: jeremyw: that doesn't mean you're not a virgin. *shifty eyes*
