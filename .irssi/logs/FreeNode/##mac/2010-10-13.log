09:24  richardcavell: Is there a program for Mac that will allow me to record my voice start and stop, like a dictaphone?
09:38  richardcavell: I'll answer my own question: ExpressDictate for Mac at download.com

10:36  A_SN: hi, I'd like to find out which line '0x0000bce1 my_function + 332' matches to, how do I do that?
10:43  Branes: Programming questions to #macosxdev please
10:45  A_SN: oops, my bad, wrong channel
10:45  DarkStar1: Help. I ned a good (and free) voice recording program for the AMc
10:45  DarkStar1: MAC*
10:46  richardcavell: I asked that myself an hour ago
10:46  richardcavell: download.com -> ExpressDictate
10:46  richardcavell: works perfectly
10:46  Branes: It's "Mac" short for "Macintosh", an MAC can be found in the ethernet interface of your windows machine :)
10:47  DarkStar1: Thanks BRANES. Good to see you have a sense of humour :P
10:48  Branes: Well, we're fussy about such things :)
10:48  LSD`: Branes: Not just on Windows ;)
10:49  DarkStar1: You correcting a Brane?? How dare you ^_^
10:50  Branes: If toothbrushes had an MAC, linux tweakers would try to put their OS on it :)
10:55  DarkStar1: gtg
10:55  manda_moore: beachball of doom!
10:57  stix: Hi guys. I am considering buying a SSD for my MB Pro. But what's up with this Trim-function - is that only supported on windows systems? And do I really need it to feel the difference?
10:58  LSD`: TRIM stops the drive from slowing down over time due to it having to completely erase previously used cells before writing new data to them. Linux and Windows support it, but OS X doesn't as yet. Drives based on the Sandforce controller chips handle something approximating it in hardware, but it's not as good as full TRIM support
10:59  stix: LSD`, okay thank you - so is it a bad idea to invest in a SSD?
11:02  Branes: stix: It's a good idea if you want speed *and* have a ruthless backup regime.
11:03  stix: okay, I should just go for an SSD based on the Sandforce controller
11:04  Branes: It'll still not last as long under OSX.
11:04  LSD`: Cnsider sacrificing your optical drive in favour of a second HDD tray as well
11:05  stix: hmm
11:05  Branes: OSX is *brutal* on hard disk use, thanks to its uncontrollable swap system, insistence on indexing everything, and its woefully non-prioritising defragmentation system.
11:06  stix: It sounds like I should wait for OS X will support TRIM then
11:06  stix: if they'll ever do that
11:06  LSD`: TRIM support won't fixe the problems Branes is talking about
11:07  LSD`: SSDs of reasonable enough capacity to be considered as replacements for the platter drive in single bay setup are frighteningly expensive, not to mention not everything has to be on the SSD and you'll want some place to keep your data for when the thing inevitably goes tits up
11:07  Branes: Hence the need for a ruthless backup system.
11:08  LSD`: You should have that in place anyway, but having a large platter drive for data and applications that don't need to be on the SSD is still a good idea
11:08  stix: I thought SSD's would live much longer than mechanical drives
11:08  LSD`: stix: they don't
11:08  Branes: Admittedly Apple's own choice in SSDs are very average, but just going on what I've had to repair about half of the machines shipped with an SSD need to come back for a warranty exchange on the SSD module after 6-9 months.
11:09  richardcavell: well that's no good
11:09  richardcavell: if you're looking for reliability
11:09  stix: that's very bad
11:09  Branes: Yeah, its a shocking return rate.
11:09  richardcavell: I used to have a 7200 rpm external drive, but I dropped it all the time and it had a lot of gyroscopic inertia.  It was unreliable.  So I bought a 5400 rpm external drive.  As slow as all hell but it works 100.0000% of the time.
11:09  LSD`: Even outside of OS X, reliability is still a problem. Intel, who make some of the best SSDs on the market (they were the best before the Sandforce-based drives hit), can't escape it
11:10  richardcavell: I have two, actually.  One for Time Machine and one for Carbon Copy Cloner.
11:10  stix: well if I cant even expect the drive to run for a year, I won't invest that much money in it
11:10  Branes: Apple not only need to support TRIM and spread-cell management, they also need to reign in their own software, and let the advanced user specify a volume or location for swap.
11:11  LSD`: wear levelling is handled by the controllers on the drives
11:11  Psixerces: richardcavell:  You dropped it all the time and your surprised its unreliable within a year?
11:11  richardcavell: No I wasn't surprised
11:12  richardcavell: See, when it was running, if I moved it at all, the gyroscopic forces would work against me
11:12  richardcavell: difficult to describe
11:12  LSD`: It's why they make the drives in capacities like 30, 60 or 120GB, the excess cells are reserved for wer levelling and on the fly remapping
11:13  Branes: richardcavell: irrespective of size or capacity, you're not meant to move a hard drive that is in operation.
11:13  richardcavell: Yeah I know
11:14  richardcavell: Well that drive ended up in the bin
11:14  richardcavell: I'm very solemn about my backups now
11:14  richardcavell: I do it religiously
11:14  Psixerces: Thats why I bought a NAS, and clone to an image on the NAS
11:15  richardcavell: isn't that deprecated?
11:15  LSD`: (maintaining a stock of spares isn't something unique to SSDs, platter drives do it to, it's just no one has ever had any need to notice because magnetic cells don't tend to self-destruct after about 100,000 uses)
11:15  richardcavell: Cos if one part of the image corrupts, the whole thing corrupts
11:15  Psixerces: Well I don't use a single image.
11:16  Psixerces: I rotate the image files I use.
11:16  richardcavell: You can use a sparsebundle as a TM image but I've been told that's a really bad idea
11:16  Psixerces: I don't use time machine myself.   Doesn't work with File Vault well.
11:17  Psixerces: Full CCC Clone - Incremental Sparse Image - at the moment I have the space to do a full backup every 6 months and maintain those with incrememntals
11:17  Psixerces: Helps that my Home Dir is independent of the Sys Drive.
11:17  richardcavell: ok
11:17  richardcavell: Branes: What's your take on FileVault?  I've heard of people losing all their data
11:17  richardcavell: I tried to turn it on on my puter but it gives me an error every time and won't complete
11:18  Branes: It can be problematic; I'm not a fan of encyption at the best of times.
11:18  Psixerces: I wouldn't convert a profile myself.   I only encrypt my Home Dir because its a laptop - I don't do so for my home machine.
11:18  LSD`: things like filevault are for the kinds of people who wear hats made of aluminium to keep the CIA from hearing their thoughts
11:19  Psixerces: But I store music / pics outside of the vault itself via symlinks - causes a problem or two with some apps that can't handle symlinks though, but iTunes, iPhoto, Aperture work fine.
11:20  Psixerces: LSD` Or those that deal with confidential data that they work on.  (Which could be client databases, banking records, contact details etc)
11:21  richardcavell: well what bothers me about FileVault is that once you're logged in, the contents of the disk are readily accessible
11:21  richardcavell: I wish OS X had whole-disk encryption
11:21  LSD`: Psixerces: Data like that should never be allowed to wind up in a situation where it needs to be encrypted, to be frank
11:22  Psixerces: So you would save your banking records, documents for tax purposes unencrypted on a laptop that could be stolen would you?
11:23  Psixerces: The main reason I deal with client databases/contact details etc, is usually converting it from one system to another, and then I usually delete the files.
11:23  Psixerces: and yes I could store that inside a temporary encrypted disk image, but that just means creating a new one each time
11:29  Branes: The other big problem with FileVault is that it wants the same amount of free space as you have in your home directory, plus 5%.
11:32  richardcavell: you mean just when it's encrypting?
11:35  Branes: No, all the time.
11:36  Branes: As you've said, when you're logged in you're working with a live unencrypted copy of your ~/. When you log out it updates the stripes that have changed in the encrypted invisible copy.
11:39  richardcavell: So what happens to your unencrypted copy when you log out?
11:39  LSD`: Psixerces: I'm not important enough to be the victim of a targetd theft, anyone who stole or found my laptop most likely won't care about the data on it. If I was part of an organisation like MI5 though, I wouldn't let sensitive data out on employee laptops, that's for damn sure
11:40  Psixerces: if its a targeted theft - they will get into it regardless.    Using file vault prevents someone that knows how to boot a computer from another disk and getting access to all your data.
11:41  Psixerces: when you manage computers and do data recovery for a living, you don't trust "my computer has a password so my data is secure"
11:42  LSD`: I'm more like "My computer has a password so the kinds of people most likely to steal it will be more likely to simply reformat it than ferret around for worthless data"
11:43  richardcavell: If you have FileVault turned on, what about your Time Machine backups or clones?  Are they encrypted too?
11:44  Branes: Time Machine and FileVault don't work together very well, because the only thing TIme Machine will archive is the encrypted, full version of your home. You get no benefits of auto-backups happening with FileVault active.
11:45  Branes: You might have TM set to back things up once every ten minutes, but that will only apply to items outside your home -- that will never be backed up until you are logged out, and the non-live encrypted copy is updated.
11:46  Angostura: Yes, silly that
11:46  Angostura: Well not silly, because that implies 'trivially easy to fix'
11:46  Branes: Hence why I say encryption is pointless, and often causes more problems than it purports to cure -- if you have data of any kind you don't want someone else seeing, you don't keep it on the computer, nor on anything else that is easily stolen.
11:46  Angostura: But very disapointing
11:47  Angostura: Branes: That's daft because it implies you keep all your data in your head
11:47  LSD`: It just adds more overhead for little to no tangible benefit
11:48  Angostura: It doesn't  cause more problems than it purports to cure. It just causes problems, which may or may not be worth the benefits to you
11:48  Psixerces: Tangible benefit is an arbitary value - who's value depends on the person perceiving the value of said function.
11:48  Angostura: For you, the benefits aren't sufficient
11:48  Angostura: Psixerces: Exactly
11:49  Psixerces: For key documents, I use forever save to go back in versions, which means a backup is more valuable if its an entire backup, rather then an hour by hour.
11:49  Angostura: It also depends on circumstance. I don't habitually use Time Machine on my desktop...
11:49  bassliner: thing is, when you indeed encrypt all your data you sleep better.
11:49  Angostura: s/Time Machine/Filevault/
11:49  Angostura: However if I take it into a repair shop, I will enable FV
11:49  bassliner: and i would probably want to use aes or twofish for that.
11:49  Branes: No it doesn't, ango, it means it's kept somewhere safe. if I have private or security-critical data I need with me, I keep it on a device which has its own encryption engine and protection.
11:50  Angostura: Branes: This proving that encryption isn't pointless
11:50  Branes: Heck, keeping your birth certificate and bank account details on cloud storage is safer and more secure than relying on local disk encryption.
11:51  LSD`: bassliner: I'm mentally stable enough that I sleep just fine without disk encryption :P
11:51  Psixerces: Assuming you trust the cloud
11:52  LSD`: Paranoia is often a symptom of mental illness ;)
11:52  bassliner: LSD`: mentally stable you say uh, well, i'm an lsd user at heart but i know that security paranoia pays off in the end of it all. :)
11:53  Psixerces: tell me LSD` - Do you run an AV at all?
11:53  bassliner: LSD`: and i don't use disk encryption on any of the 3 notebooks i have right now and i'm attempting to change that so i know i don't have to care about what i take with me that much.
11:53 --- Hatrix is now known as Rubarb
11:54  bassliner: LSD`: i mean it has almost no caveats or something. on a todays machine you probably won't notice it being slower.
11:54  Angostura: I think it's fair not to 'trust' the cloud.
11:54  Rubarb: Does any know if the rumours of a touch iMac in early 2011 are likely to be ture?
11:55  Angostura: I use Mozy for backups, but I don't rely on it. I've heard too many restore nightmares
11:55  Psixerces: Security it about layering your defense, so it pisses off those who don't want to put the effort into getting into your system.  If someone a 90/10 situation, you can block 90% of the people with 10% of the effort - but blocking the last 10% requires 90% of the effort.
11:55  Angostura: Rubarb: sjobs, maybe about 10 other people
11:56  LSD`: Psixerces: defending yourself is one thing, but going to outrageous extremes for stupid reasons is another entirely
11:56  Rubarb: lool so it's not going to happen?
11:56  Branes: Closer to forty, Ango, but they're all inner-inner-circle staff.
11:56  Psixerces: how is file vault outrageous?   Its a tickbox when you set it up, or in my case - when I logged in, my system automatically created the file vault and sync'd my home directory from my server.
11:57  LSD`: having played with HPs attempts at the form factor, I sincerely hope Apple don't release a touch iMac
11:57  Psixerces: in terms of system use - the only time I have any issues with file vault, are when I try to use quicktime X to record a movie.
11:57  Branes: I sincerely hope they *do*, but it'll resemble an iPad more than the current iMac.'
11:58  Branes: The screen needs to be where the hands normally rest; that's just obvious ergonomics.
11:58  Psixerces: they should design it so the screen both tilts and swivels at least 90 deg.
11:58  Rubarb: Ah okay, and will  27" remain the top-end model?
11:59  Branes: What's more likely, I think, is they'll make use of that three-year-old patent where they have an iMac formfactor acting as a large dock for a portable computing device.
11:59  Psixerces: think of the use of a touch screen iMac as a kiosk, or manipulating data in a photostudio.
11:59  LSD`: Thing is, it just doesn't work unless you build teh UI from teh ground up to support it. Simply bolting touch functionality to a UI that wasn't designed for it is the mistake Microsft have been making for twenty years.
12:00  Branes: Wrong.
12:00  Branes: Microsoft never considered the correct paradigm for interaction when they mutated MacOS' GUI enough so that SteveCo would get off their backs.
12:01  Angostura: The interesting thing (perhaps) is that Apple has spent a lot of time working out how to use multi-touch trackpads with the OS X UI, so that work may be applicable to multitouch screens
12:01  Branes: By then, it'd become almost impossible to properly shift the one-finger-pointing paradigm Apple had maintained, so trying to do touch with Windows was just farcicle.
12:01  Psixerces: there is no reason why a multi-touch trackpad, keyboard and imac sides touch screen couldn't all be used at once.
12:02  Angostura: indeed
12:02  Psixerces: think off all the apps you use where you move contents that could be done by touch.
12:02  Psixerces: sorting photos, movie clips...
12:02  Psixerces: and lets not forget solitare
12:02  Branes: That's one reason why MacOS-as-we-know-it has a short shelf-life, iOS is coming to the desktop.
12:02  Angostura: Personally i have little interest in a multitouch Mac, but I wouldn't put it past them to come up with something compelling
12:03  Angostura: yeh, yeh
12:03  Psixerces: iOS has a long way to go before it will be used in bulk deployments.
12:03  Branes: Oh, absolutely.
12:03  Psixerces: even something as simple as content restriction via the iPhone Config Utility doesn't work.
12:03  LSD`: Branes: iOS gets it right because it forgoes most of the existing WIMP paradigm entirely in favour of something more suited to touch input. Simply putting a touch panel on a standard OS X UI won't work, for the same reasons it fails on Windows
12:04  Angostura: iOS coming to the desktop would be the same category of error as pointing full OS X to the iPhone
12:04  Psixerces: there is no capability for setting proxy settings via the utility either.
12:04  Branes: Springboard needs a major work-over, as will many of the new frameworks, and they're still to add the bulk of functionality OSX currently enjoys. But give them time, give them time :)
12:04  Angostura: By the time they have done all that it won't be iOS
12:05  Branes: You don't know Steve very well :)
12:05  Psixerces: I think what you might end up with is a dual interface..    The underlying OS upgraded from what we have now, but a touch layer that operates like iOS.
12:05 * Branes shakes his head
12:05  Angostura: Psixerces: AKA Dashboard
12:05  Psixerces: the underlying OS would give more bulk management then the iOS supports.
12:05  Branes: Nuh-uh. Remember the target market, and then stop thinking like a geek.
12:05  Branes: Interface first.
12:05  LSD`: Ultimately, we'll probably end up with a real-life version of teh LCARS-style interface in Star Trek TNG
12:05  Psixerces: yes - and then try and deal with a bulk deployment of 100+ 1:1 iPads.
12:06  Angostura: oh god
12:06  Branes: Close. More like Ufflinger's work than Okuda's.
12:06  Angostura: who Branes ?
12:06  Branes: John Ufflinger.
12:07  Branes: He designed the UI for the movie "Minority Report"
12:07  Angostura: Google says " No results found for "John Ufflinger"."
12:08  Branes: Gah, have I mis-remembered his surname spelling again? :)
12:08  LSD`: I liked teh way the UIs worked in avatar. Holographic displays that gave you a 360 degree panorama that shifted as you rotated teh chair, being able to connect a tablet device, throw somethign scross to it and walk away with it, that sort of thing
12:08  Branes: Underfokkler
12:08  Branes: ga!
12:08  Branes: John Underkoffler
12:08  Branes: http://www.ted.com/talks/john_underkoffler_drive_3d_data_with_a_gesture.html
12:09  Angostura: How could forget? :-)
12:09  Branes: rong names be rong
12:09  LSD`: heh, now who needs to be sent back to 4chan XD
12:10  Branes: That predates 4chan by decades, junior :)
12:10  Psixerces: well I could ask a question about a Magic Triangle and Kerberos with Augmented User Records if you don't want 4chan
12:11  Branes: Meh, you just keep working on writing backend, we'll stick to interface that you can bolt code to :)
12:11  LSD`: "I can understand some regressions for an lts release, it is going to be supported for 3 years, some kind of sacrifices may need to be made in the name of stability." <- Why Linux is forever doomed to failure on teh desktop, i na single sentence :P
12:12  Psixerces: lol, the only reason I am looking into Augmented User Records - is because our POS ISP not handling the mail.   Want to setup a cheap inhouse mail server, without the need to setup another user database.
12:13  Psixerces: or correction - the iPads repeatedly sending email to a bad address and getting our IP blacklisted temporarily.
12:19  Psixerces: now this would be an interesting desk to have - http://steampunkworkshop.com/organ-cockpit-desk
14:10  ichdertom: is there any way to disable the keyboard?
14:11  klumpy: Unplug it.
14:12  thelostpatrol: ichdertom, please give context
14:12  LaraX: do you want to use on screen keyboard instead?
14:14  Branes: ichdertom: If you are asking about disabling the built-in keyboard of a MacBook, that is not possible.

15:09  sgfgdf: hello guys, i have a problem with my wireless reciever. when i try to join some network in school it is very very slow, and the strength (bars) of the netowrk is very poor. i also asked some of my colleagues and their connections seemed to be good. i'm using macbook pro, model - late 2008. any suggestions?
15:09  fargiolas: hi, I'm new to osx (coming from years of linux only), do you know if is there a videoplayer for osx that autodownloads subtitles?
15:10  crilly: fargiolas: Is there one in Linux?
15:10  sgfgdf: fargiolas: what does "autodownload subtitles" mean?
15:11  fargiolas: crilly: totem has a plugin for downloading subtitles from opensubtitles.org, smplayer has one too
15:12  fargiolas: sgfgdf: I mean looking up in some subtitle website for the filename (and maybe file checksum) and download a subtitle file for it
15:12  sgfgdf: fargiolas: that's new to me. do you specify a language you prefer?
15:13  fargiolas: sgfgdf: yep
15:15  fargiolas: (usually the website is opensubtitles.org as it provides a public xmlrpc api for that specific purpose)
15:15  sgfgdf: fargiolas: probably you should look for if there is version for mac os of smplayer.  really don't know and can't help you. it was just nterested in your question.
15:17  sgfgdf: there are mplayer GUI integrations, so i hope the smplayer has integrations too.
15:18  fargiolas: sgfgdf: apparently smplayer comes for windows and linux only and I believe the opensubtitle feature comes from the "S" frontend and not from mplayer itself
15:19  fargiolas: need to investigate more, but it seems that vuze integrated video player has something like that http://wiki.vuze.com/w/FAQ_HD_Player
15:20  sgfgdf: fargiolas: probably you are right, but i would go to choose my video player at firt place if it supports "autodownload sub.." or not and then see if the player is playing video at all.
15:21  greatbuy: i smac gay?
15:21  greatbuy: mac
15:21  greatbuy: is mac gay?
15:21  sgfgdf: that's the question of the day!
15:22  greatbuy: u mean of the decade?
15:23  crilly: fargiolas: Maybe VLC player can do it?
15:23  sgfgdf: greatbuy: so you suggest to tell you the secret of the decade so easy?
15:23  Branes: If MacOS is gay, then Windows is bestiality and linux is necrophilia
15:23  greatbuy: huh?
15:23  fargiolas: crilly: I'm looking into it right now, it seems there is some user provide exstension
15:23 * fargiolas reboots into osx to test
15:24  greatbuy: windows is hetrosxual

15:24  Branes: ... gee, realy? 8-)
15:25  sgfgdf: Branes: there is nothing bad with linux, even we talk for it as a desktop os.
15:26  crilly: It's not really that good as a desktop OS unless you're a more advanced computer user. It's a fantastic server OS though.
15:28  sgfgdf: crilly: yes if we compare it with mac os as a dekstop all we know what will happen. but nowadays there are very user friendly linux distributions, that amazed me.
15:28  crilly: Ubuntu is good
15:30  Kasm279|Away: [07:23:31] <Branes> If MacOS is gay, then Windows is bestiality and linux is necrophilia

15:35  crilly: Re-post it.
15:35  Kasm279|Away: repost
15:35  sgfgdf: hello guys, i have a problem with my wireless reciever. when i try to join some network in school it is very very slow, and the strength (bars) of the netowrk is very poor. i also asked  some of my colleagues and their connections seemed to be good. i'm using macbook pro, model - late 2008. any suggestions?
15:36  Kasm279|Away: sgfgdf: do you have this problem with any other wireless networks?
15:37  sgfgdf: Kasm279|Away: there was a few networks that i can join in school and none of them was good. i've tried all of them.
15:38  crilly: what about networks at outside of school? WHat security does the school have in place on their network?
15:38  sgfgdf: i have wi-fi at home, but it this case the router is one step close to me. so it could not be relevant.
15:39  sgfgdf: crilly: they are free to join.
15:39  crilly: that doesn't mean there isn't any security.
15:39  crilly: what about othe networks, like at friend's houses etc?
15:41  sgfgdf: crilly: i tried to join some wi-fi networks at cofffee shop etc. and i haven't had problems.
15:43  sgfgdf: crilly: the strange things is that all my collegues didn't have a problem with the same network.
15:43  sgfgdf: *thing
15:43  fargiolas: uhm, still me, apparently vlc on osx doesn't support extensions or I'm too newbie to understand how to enable them
15:43  crilly: fargiolas: #videolan
15:43  crilly: sgfgdf: Hmm. What wireless protocols does the school network use? G/N?
15:43  sgfgdf: i think if there wasn't a know bug in the AirPort or something.
15:43  sgfgdf: g
15:44  crilly: So you get a route to the public Internet, but it's really slow?
15:45  sgfgdf: crilly: i try to ping some dns and the time ping returns was way bigger than the normal i get. besides i get a large drops (timeouts).
15:46  sgfgdf: i don't think the problem is was in the network at all, but in the strength. i have only one bar.
15:46  crilly: And the signal you're getting is really poor? What signal strength do your colleagues get?
15:47  sgfgdf: not full, but something like from 70% to 80%.
15:47  crilly: Interesting.
15:49  sgfgdf: now i remember that i tried to join some wi-fi network at the past which was my frind's one and i could get signal, but my sister connects somehow.
15:51  sgfgdf: anybody knows how to i check what firmware version uses my  AirPort?
15:51  crilly: I would connect to a weak network and do some networking traces on packets etc, and then do the same again on a string network connection
15:51  crilly: system profiler
15:52  crilly: sgfgdf: http://cl.ly/2ov4
15:53  sgfgdf: AirPort Utility: 5.5.1 (551.19). what should be the current one?
15:54  sgfgdf: ops
15:54  crilly:   Firmware Version:	Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.91.27)
15:54  crilly: That's mine, but are we on the same model/year MBP?
15:56  sgfgdf: macbook pro late 2008.
15:56  sgfgdf: i buy it and after some months they released the new one :)
15:56  crilly: Might be the same as mine. Mine is id-2009 I think
15:56  crilly: oh
15:57  sgfgdf: is this applyable for me http://support.apple.com/downloads/AirPort_Extreme_Firmware_Update_5_7_for_Mac_OS_X ?
15:58  crilly: I have no idea. I would assume the Software Updater would find the latest version for your system.
15:59  sgfgdf: doh, this is for the device AirPort Extreme.
16:00  crilly: hehe that'sa router
16:02  sgfgdf: it is indeed a router :). silly me.
16:03  sgfgdf: anyway have to go. thank you all for the suggestions. will continue to explore the problem.

22:16  PigFlu: what happens if i type "idle" in terminal?
22:17  Branes: the processor glances distractedly around the inside of the case, twiddles its thumbs and breaks out into a synthesized rendition of "Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"?
22:18  Angostura: I think that's only on the early 2005 iMacs, branes
22:18  Angostura: possibly the Minis too
22:19  PigFlu: let me guess. none of you have any idea, you just know macs look shiny and cute?
22:20  PigFlu: jesus, you apple people are completely hopeless
22:20  sr0z: hhaha
22:20  b3ny0-: what happened?
22:20  ChrisAM: PigFlu ... http://www.fpaste.org/gC9G/
22:21  b3ny0-: jesus, you are quick to cast the first stone
22:21  sr0z: can't wait more than four minutes for a response
22:22  Angostura: PigFlu:  I think I assumed that you were pissing about
22:25  ChrisAM: PigFlu ... if I type idle with no parameters, it just opens a python shell.
22:26  barathron: Apple broke $300 a share today O.O 
22:28  PigFlu: Why isnt there a "new file" option when i right click in finder?
22:29  zer0her0: PigFlu: ?!
22:29  zer0her0: what kind of file are you creating?
22:29  PigFlu: usually a text file. or a jsp file
22:29  jeremyw: Open up <insert app for creating your type of file>, File > Save As
22:29  ChrisAM: Windows has that feature... and you can customize the file types in the "New" list.
22:30  jeremyw: Or...open Terminal.app: touch PATH_TO_NEW_FILE
22:30  Angostura: PigFlu: Because Finder doesn't provide one natively, however
22:30  PigFlu: i know windows has that feature.
22:30  jeremyw: There are many, many, many ways to do this.
22:30  PigFlu: Mac doesnt.
22:30  zer0her0: and this isn't windows?
22:30  jeremyw: OS X isn't Windows.
22:30  Angostura: You can create a Service to do it using Automator if you want
22:30  jeremyw: Hard to believe, I know.
22:30  zer0her0: jeremyw: windows has a start menu in the bottom left corner, where do i find that on my mac?
22:30  PigFlu: jeremyw, i dont want to open up some app each time.
22:30  jeremyw: Let me check.
22:31  PigFlu: i want to make a new file somewhere.
22:31  Angostura: PigFlu: You saw my earlier answer
22:31  jeremyw: PigFlu: Why do you want to randomly create files places...at some point, you'll need to edit it so do it all at once.  Or listen to Angostura.
22:31  PigFlu: Angostura, i tried that, its shit.
22:31  PigFlu: you have to right click an already existing file for it to work
22:31  Angostura: aaaand, you're on ignore. Bye
22:31  PigFlu: which.. makes the whole idea pointless
22:32  Angostura: Come back when you're not being a twat
22:32  jeremyw: haha
22:32  PigFlu: im not being a twat.
22:32  PigFlu: im just telling you your solution does not suffice
22:32  zer0her0: i don't see how it's even a problem
22:33  jeremyw: PigFlu: Listen...Finder doesn't do what you want.  Cope with it, work around it or just create the file when you need to use it with whatever tool/editor you choose.  It's not hard to get past this.
22:33  jeremyw: That's the answer.
22:33  zer0her0: you inevitably need to open this file yes? why not just create in in said app
22:33  jeremyw: That's what I said.
22:33  ChrisAM: or open terminal and type "touch file.ext"
22:33  PigFlu: also, jeremyw, its way faster to create a new file when im working in or around some folder, than to go open the app, write the file, then find the folder im working in and save as
22:33  zer0her0: or use a script to programatically creat the files
22:33  jeremyw: ChrisAM: Suggested already...
22:33  ChrisAM: don't mind me
22:33  zer0her0: PigFlu: you do realize you can create folders in the app
22:33  PigFlu: i love how "you cant do that in apple. deal with it" is the answer to everything
22:34  jeremyw: ChrisAM: That wasn't a knock on you, just that you're probably wasting your time like the rest of us.
22:34  zer0her0: PigFlu: we gave you suggestions
22:34  jeremyw: PigFlu: We've given you answers on how to do this, just not with Finder.  Finder != Windows Explorer...what other answer should we give you?
22:34  zer0her0: you want windows...go use windows
22:34  zer0her0: haha
22:35  zer0her0: reminds me of my friends grandfather refusing to drive my friends car one day cause the shifter wasn't on the stearing column like he was used to.
22:35  jeremyw: PigFlu: http://lifehacker.com/247149/mimic-windows-create-new-file-with-quicksilver
22:35  jeremyw: You can install QuickSilver and quickly create files without opening an app.
22:36  jeremyw: Since using the other options don't help you, try that.
22:36  jeremyw: If even that doesn't help, I'll try to help further.
22:37  ChrisAM: PigFlu ... http://growlichat.com/NuFile.php
22:38  PigFlu: tried nufile, doesnt work.
22:40  Angostura: ChrisAM: That looks rather nifty
22:41  Branes: mmm, AAPL still sitting on $300.14 per. Not bad.
22:42  Angostura: It's that 'Back to Mac' invite wot done it
22:43  Angostura: That and the fact that Steve announced today that the company was going to revert its name back to 'Apple Computer'
22:43  Angostura: bit of a surprise that one
22:43  thelostpatrol: he did?
22:43  thelostpatrol: i need a source for that
22:44  Angostura: No, just indulging in some obvious trolling
22:44  Angostura: apologies
22:44  thelostpatrol: hehe
22:44  Angostura: Well, I can dream, can't I?
22:45  PigFlu: If apple started making cars, there would be only 1 pedal.
22:45  PigFlu: ie, you wouldnt be able to use it. at all
22:45  sr0z: Done yet?
22:45  b3ny0-: blabla.. platform wars
22:46  b3ny0-: zzzz
22:46  b3ny0-: use whatever fits you
22:46  PigFlu: yea..
22:46  b3ny0-: I use both win and osx because I think both have their uses
22:46  PigFlu: i just dont see why someone would buy a car they couldnt use.. but watever
22:46  sr0z: bad analogy. see, i am using a mac.. RIGHT NOW. 
22:46  b3ny0-: well yeah
22:46  b3ny0-: except that you CAN use a mac
22:46  b3ny0-: ;)
22:47  PigFlu: you cant make it do what you want, though.
22:47  zer0her0: PigFlu: i can
22:47  sr0z: really?
22:47  PigFlu: i mean, i can use a rock too.
22:47  PigFlu: doesnt mean i can make it fly
22:47  b3ny0-: and they DO have a right-click now, its disguised as the "secondary button" :P

22:48  PigFlu: ill stfu now. ill probably have some questions for later
22:48 @zer0her0: PigFlu: no i'm just tired of your complaining
22:48  b3ny0-: some amounts of the bashing are justified
22:48 @zer0her0: i use Mac OS X, Win XP, Win 7, and various Linux machines just fine
22:49  sr0z: You just sit here and talk crap. Just complaining.
22:49  b3ny0-: use OS X for most things nowadays, I power on the windows desktop when I want to play games
22:49  PigFlu: im just frustrated because ive had a mac for 6 weeks, and im still raging pretty hard each time i have to do something more complicated than check my mail
22:49  b3ny0-: I was afraid it was going to be that way when I switched
22:50  sr0z: Then find other ways to deal with the frustrations.
22:50  b3ny0-: but except for some minor frustrations its mostly gone well
22:50 @zer0her0: PigFlu: you have some anger issues i think ;)
22:50  barathron: PigFlu: what are you having so much trouble with?
22:50  PigFlu: the biggest concern is my non-english keyboard, which hides a few vital keys
22:50  PigFlu: for instance, there is no [ or { key
22:50  b3ny0-: for instance, it sucks that apple refuses to officially implement flac support
22:50  PigFlu: i have to press a combination of like 3 keys to get those
22:51  PigFlu: sucks when doing java
22:51 @zer0her0: b3ny0-: they have ALAC, so it aint gonna happen.
22:51  b3ny0-: yes I know
22:51  b3ny0-: but who uses apple lossless
22:51  b3ny0-: but yes, that's their reason
22:51 @zer0her0: i know several people.
22:51  b3ny0-: I haven't met a single one
22:51  b3ny0-: I know loads of people who use flac though
22:52 @zer0her0: yea they're called pirates ;)
22:52 @zer0her0: j/k
22:52 --- zer0her0 sets modes [##mac -o zer0her0]
22:52  PigFlu: also, i hate how you cant click icons to minimize
22:52  b3ny0-: the codec itself is not piracy
22:52  b3ny0-: I ripped my entire CD collection to flac recently
22:52  b3ny0-: and itunes won't play it
22:52  b3ny0-: thanks a lot
22:53  Angostura: ChrisAM: FYI NuFile doesn't get along with Snow Leopard
22:53  zer0her0: b3ny0-: way to do research
22:53  PigFlu: you have to go up and click the little yellow button, and the entire window goes into that other space and jesus christ i want to smash someones face
22:53  b3ny0-: fluke sucked pretty hard
22:53  b3ny0-: zer0her0: well I've been a pc user for the last 16 years
22:53  b3ny0-: and I wasn't really planning on getting a mac at the time
22:54  PigFlu: Angostura, why does it not
22:54  PigFlu: i want nufile
22:54  zer0her0: b3ny0-: you said recently?
22:54  b3ny0-: probably 6-8 months ago
22:54  b3ny0-: I don't keep track all that well :)
22:54  PigFlu: also, WHY CANT YOU CUT FILES

22:55  barathron: http://www.simplehelp.net/2008/06/12/how-to-play-flac-files-in-itunes/
22:55  b3ny0-: what I miss the most from windows is foobar2k
22:55  PigFlu: seriously, how do you move a file from one place to another?
22:55  zer0her0: eh, flac is supported on so few things, i just stick w/ good ol .mp3 format for the foreseeable future
22:55  b3ny0-: drag it
22:55  PigFlu: uhm, no
22:55  b3ny0-: mp3 is lossy
22:55  PigFlu: that takes 10 years
22:55  Branes: bara, that fix 'broke' with iTunes 9 & 10
22:55  PigFlu: also, that copies it
22:55  barathron: PigFlu: you're kidding right? YOu can make it on IRC but you can move a file?
22:55  zer0her0: PigFlu: hold down option while dragging
22:55  zer0her0: b3ny0-: yes i know
22:55  PigFlu: ...
22:56  barathron: ah bummer branes
22:56  barathron: I care not myself about flac
22:56 * Branes sticks to AIF personally
22:56  PigFlu: why cant you cut files?
22:56  zer0her0: heh
22:56  PigFlu: cmd+x ?
22:56  barathron: AIF is way bulky :(
22:57  Branes: Because Apple consider it a security risk.
22:57  b3ny0-: okay, perhaps its close to impossible to notice any difference between MP3 320 and FLAC
22:57  PigFlu: DUDE
22:57  b3ny0-: but I like the reassurance that I have a backup where nothing has been lost
22:57  zer0her0: PigFlu: breathe
22:57  PigFlu: its not up to apple to decide what i should and shouldnt do ffs
22:57  Colloguy: where does the file go once it's cut?
22:57  Branes: Steve thinks otherwise.
22:57  zer0her0: b3ny0-: you said you ripped your collection? there's your backup?
22:57  PigFlu: maybe i shouldnt even use the mac for anything because its a security risk?
22:57  bassliner: PigFlu: then you will most likely want to use a linux system.
22:57  b3ny0-: well yeah
22:57  zer0her0: PigFlu: or you're incable of change
22:57  b3ny0-: you make multiple copies
22:57  Branes: barathron: bulk isn't an issue, AIFs are just backups of the real vinyl & CD media.
22:58  PigFlu: you can cut text cant you? isnt losing text a risk?
22:58  Colloguy: but you want the file in hte filesystem to appear faded?
22:58  Colloguy: or to disappear, once you cut it?
22:58  PigFlu: ?
22:59  zer0her0: PigFlu: apple.com/feedback
22:59  PigFlu: i want to go to the clipboard or whatever is holding it
22:59  bassliner: PigFlu: there's most of the time a good way to do it the mac way and that way will very likely work proper, but if you want to do stuff the way YOU like, then you will notice there are times where you just want to stab steve with a giant rusty thing a few hundred times.
22:59  PigFlu: then go to where ever i paste it.
22:59  Colloguy: so it disappears from the Finder?
22:59  PigFlu: how is that relevant?
22:59  PigFlu: sure
22:59  zer0her0: how is what relevant?
22:59  jeremyw: Creating a file with QuickSilver...not intuitive but it works.  I just tried it.  Just in case.
22:59  bassliner: PigFlu: at least that's what i more and more notice.
22:59  Colloguy: Finder should probably be consistent with the filesystem it is supposed to show
22:59  b3ny0-: you expected total freedom from OS X?
23:00  bassliner: b3ny0-: i don't even expect "total freedom" from freebsd or linux.
23:00  Colloguy: a file that you cut, disappears in Finder, yet is still on disk exactly where it once was
23:00  eightfold: anybody know a free text editor with code completion for css/html?
23:00  PigFlu: i dont really expect ANYTHING from os x
23:00  Colloguy: wierd dissonance
23:00  bassliner: b3ny0-: because you won't even get close to the possibilities it gives you.
23:00  eightfold: textwrangler doesn't seem to have it
23:00  eightfold: i've been using fraise now
23:00  eightfold: but i'm missing code completion
23:00  b3ny0-: no, its too complicated to alter drastically for most users
23:01  Colloguy: if the file you cut disappears in Finder, then what happens if you rename a file to the name of the file you cut?
23:01  PigFlu: Colloguy, what are you babbling about?
23:01  bassliner: b3ny0-: the thing is that those kind of discussion occurs in mac channels every damn evening and they don't occur in linux or bsd channels for exactly one reason: you actually CAN change things and customize the machine to your needs if you NEED to, but you don't HAVE to.
23:01  zer0her0: Colloguy: don't riddle PigFlu's poor mind w/ actual usage instances
23:02  zer0her0: he just wants to dream
23:02  b3ny0-: yes
23:02  b3ny0-: wasn't really looking to start a discussion
23:02  bassliner: b3ny0-: i love my mac and i goddamn hate the fact i can't customize a few aspects of it. especially easing things too much is just a retarded aspect of macs.
23:03  bassliner: b3ny0-: best example is the pointer acceleration curve
23:03  bassliner: b3ny0-: you get ONE slider to define the pointer speed. i mean, wtf, srsly?
23:03  zer0her0: yea i need at least 4 sliders
23:03  b3ny0-: my main gripes is still with itunes
23:03  b3ny0-: :)
23:03  zer0her0: one for each dimension
23:03  bassliner: zer0her0: you need at least 2.
23:03  b3ny0-: I hated it on windows, don't like it on OS X either
23:04  b3ny0-: at least its not sloooooow the way it was on windows
23:04  zer0her0: bassliner: naw i need at least 4
23:04  bassliner: zer0her0: that's b/s.
23:04  zer0her0: it's TRUTH
23:04  b3ny0-: I haven't really thought of the mouse acceleration tbh
23:04  PigFlu: i love how you imply i have a poor mind. you great debater, you
23:04  b3ny0-: I know quite a few who has complaints about it
23:04  bassliner: b3ny0-: because you just got used to it.
23:04  b3ny0-: no I mean I didn't notice anything different from the start
23:04  bassliner: b3ny0-: it's possible to get used to it by all means. that's not the point.
23:05  zer0her0: PigFlu: i'm a witty one, you should watch out for mwe
23:05  b3ny0-: and I mean like nothing
23:05  PigFlu: ill just ignore you.
23:05  b3ny0-: not until I started tweaking it a bit 
23:05  bassliner: b3ny0-: http://darkbyte.org/pointer.jpg
23:05  b3ny0-: now I've found a good setting for my mouse though
23:05  Colloguy: if you cut a file, and then you duplicate the containing folder, does the new folder contain a copy of the file you cut?
23:06  PigFlu: why would it
23:06  CPng|N: if you haven't pasted it elsewhere, probably
23:06  Branes: If OSes were airlines, OSX Air would have an invisible cockpit, one class of ticket, all the seats would be two-tone white and grey velour, all the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same, and every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and please sit down and enjoy the movie.
23:06  bassliner: b3ny0-: the problem with this is that the curve raised not early enough and that you can't shape the curve but only modify the multiplication of it and nothing else.
23:06  zer0her0: heh, man i'm hurt, i think i'll go to the pub w/ some mates and toss darts and cry into my pint over that
23:06  zer0her0: cheers fella's have a good eve.
23:06  PigFlu: if you cut a hole in a piece of paper, and make a photocopy of it, will what you cut out be in the copy? hurr durr
23:06  Colloguy: so if you cut a file, then the file should be moved to a clipboard somewhere, I guess to a per-disk clipboard folder
23:06  b3ny0-: I know right
23:06  bassliner: b3ny0-: that's absolutely correct.
23:06  b3ny0-: reality bites
23:06  b3ny0-: ;)
23:07  bassliner: err
23:07  PigFlu: Colloguy, you're seriously being dumb.
23:07  bassliner: Branes: that's correct.
23:07  jonysiguel: hello everyone
23:07  Angostura: yo
23:07  jonysiguel: i use a locked internet connection, so i use a proxy
23:08  bassliner: Branes: tho the stewardesses would probably look very good, they probably had strabismus and would put the knife and spoon on the wrong side of the plate.
23:08  CPng|N: Cut isn't even available to me in Finder....   ??
23:08  PigFlu: and everyone would be gay.
23:08  bassliner: haha

23:08  PigFlu: dude common.
23:09  barathron: Branes: MS Air would have a cockpit taking up half the airplane, the seats would be barf blue, all the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents would stutter so badly as to be incomprehensible, any questions would be met with 130 answers, none of which are correct, and the engines would conk out when you need them the very most ;-)
23:09 <-- zer0her0 has kicked PigFlu from ##mac (watch this rock FLYYYY)
23:09  b3ny0-: barathron: but they would have games!
23:09  CPng|N: lol
23:09  bassliner: lol
23:09  Branes: Yes, bara! And the plane would explode in mid-air five minutes from its destination.
23:10  barathron: lol
23:10  CPng|N: and you could customize the barf-color in 12 similar yet different shades
23:10  bassliner: at least you can define if you get a window seat or not.
23:10  Angostura: And with Linux you would get a really cool workshop, a set of blueprints and a set of parts
23:10 --- zer0her0 sets modes [##mac -o zer0her0]
23:11  CPng|N: Linux Air would have no seats but be the most reliable package delivery service around
23:11  bassliner: i mean srsly, you can't even change the font, oh wait, not even the font size, on a mac, without any third party tools and without the toolkit getting completely &/)(&ed up.
23:11  b3ny0-: Linux Air would be a DIY airplane
23:11  bassliner: ok, that will probably get you in issues on a windows machine too...
23:11  Branes: Nah, Ango, you rock up for your flight, given a small box of what looks like airplane parts, three random sized screwdrivers, and you spend the next year on the tarmac arguing with your fellow passengers about what you're actually meant to be building.
23:12  PigFlu: OS Air wouldnt even take off, as it would pose a security risk.
23:12  bassliner: now we know why iphones have a flight mode.
23:13  barathron: Any Apple stock owners present? 
23:14  Angostura: Branes seems pretty excited by $300
23:14  barathron: I'm pleased too :) 
23:14  barathron: who wouldn't be? 
23:14  barathron: aside from MS ;-)
23:15  Angostura: Well, I'm not desperately excited
23:15  barathron: desperately excited would be a bit much
23:15  bassliner: the biggest problem i have with a mac is that i can't configure things.
23:15  barathron: bassliner: such as? 
23:16  barathron: Plenty of third party aps let you tweak 
23:16  eightfold: what does this keyboard symbol mean: http://i.imgur.com/qq1Gp.png ?
23:16  PigFlu: how can i close the lid without it going to sleep?
23:17  PigFlu: i want to be able to close the lid, yet keep the network active
23:17  eightfold: where can i find that keyboard key?
23:17  PigFlu: not even third party apps can do that
23:17  bassliner: barathron: oh tons of stuff. the pointer acceleration is on #1. followed by font sizes, the terminal scrollbar not being able to be turned off, some stuff you just can't disable. ok, then there's the probably most giant f*ckup ever: itunes 10, which determines gapless playback information or fetches covers and i can't goddamn disable it ffs.
23:18  bassliner: barathron: i just don't like someones workflow being forced on me.
23:18  bassliner: barathron: probably that's why i'm working as a unix admin.
23:18  Angostura: Well, there are 3rd party tweaks for mouse acceleration
23:19  PigFlu: coverflow is the most useless crap ever.
23:19  Angostura: so that's sorted
23:19  bassliner: Angostura: which don't work for trackpads and cost money. nice.
23:19  MrUnagi: My son will be here tomorrow :)
23:19  bassliner: Angostura: it is absolutely not sorted.
23:19  PigFlu: MrUnagi: wat
23:19  MrUnagi: My son will be here tomorrow :)
23:19  PigFlu: again. wat
23:19  Branes: PigFlu: Because Apple's laptops are a thermodynamic disaster internally, if you attempt to run them with the lid closed you stand a much higher risk of thermal damage.
23:20  barathron: PigFlu asked: "how can i close the lid without it going to sleep?"
23:20  barathron: http://download.cnet.com/InsomniaX/3000-2094_4-97713.html?tag=vtredir
23:20  PigFlu: oh great.
23:20  MrUnagi: What part are you having trouble with 
23:20  PigFlu: again, i cant make it do what i want
23:20  PigFlu: splendid
23:20  Branes: Welcome to Apple.
23:20  Angostura: bassliner: http://triq.net/software/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x
23:20  barathron: PigFlu: google knows all 
23:20  barathron: PigFlu: I don't vouch for that ap though, never used it myself
23:21  bassliner: Angostura: i tried exactly that and it comes in 2 different flavours. one that just completely disables acceleration at all and another one that, again, does not work for trackpads. the acceleration is hard coded in the mouse driver.
23:21  barathron: bassliner: what's the prob with font sizes?
23:21  Branes: PigFlu: have a look at the sides and base of your old laptop. Count the number of holes and vents. Now do the same to your spanky new Maccy. Notice anything? :)
23:21  bassliner: Angostura: if you read the page closely you will notice that the author of the software attempts to write a program that will let you specify those curves.
23:22  bassliner: barathron: you can't change them. the dpi on displays is not always the same. neither human eyes are.
23:22  barathron: You mean in the finder? 
23:22  bassliner: no. everywhere. fonts don't just appear in a finder.
23:23  barathron: bassliner: every ap has its own prefs though 
23:23  bassliner: barathron: and...?
23:23  barathron: well you can do it in the finder 
23:24  barathron: and if the ap lets you, there too 
23:24  bassliner: i know that there are 3rd party applications (again...) which will let you specify font sizes, but not all, especially not the menu bar, and you will get a mislooking toolkit that just does not work with different font sizes proper. it's not made for that.
23:24  barathron: bassliner: you want some global font adjustment for all open aps? 
23:24  bassliner: barathron: saying that you should specify font sizes in a hundred of apps installed is probably the most retarded thing i've ever heard about the font issue on macos.
23:25  barathron: bassliner: I'm not sure why you'd expect the OS to do it for each ap though
23:25  bassliner: barathron: of course. it has nothing to do with screen resolution and it's a thing of the toolkit and not the applications that use the toolkit.
23:25  jeremyw: Damn...the Quick Search Bar from Google is awesome.
23:25  bassliner: barathron: again, because it has nothing to with an app.
23:25  barathron: bassliner: do other OSs do that?
23:26  bassliner: barathron: of course.
23:26  barathron: Well use them ;-)
23:26  barathron: lol
23:26  bassliner: barathron: i do.
23:27  bassliner: i can't get why ppl being forced to work a way they didn't specify even try to force that way on others, too.
23:27  PigFlu: how exactly do i dual boot with windows 7?
23:27  Angostura: Apple have been going on about scalabilty and resolution independence for yonks
23:27  Branes: PigFlu: Boot Camp.
23:27  Angostura: we'll see....
23:27  PigFlu: do i pop in the disc and boot from disk? follow instructions?
23:27  Branes: Specifically, /Applications/Utilities/Boot Camp Assistant
23:27  bassliner: barathron: i mean i use a lof of operating systems, especially linux/unix flavors, macs, and even some windows machines.
23:28  barathron: bassliner: and what is the feature you seek called in other OSs?
23:28  bassliner: barathron: other than macs?
23:28  barathron: yes
23:28  barathron: obviously
23:28  barathron: since you said its not in OS X
23:28 * Branes is still happy to be able to use a Mac OS that is fully customisable before it got Steve'd.
23:28  jeremyw: haha
23:29  Branes: <3 MacOS 8.6
23:29  bassliner: barathron: what you mean by "seek called"? you mean stuff that i have on a mac but not on, say, linux?
23:29  barathron: I don't miss the Bomb one bit 
23:30  barathron: bassliner: you want some kind of global font manipulation right? You said other OSs have it right? What do they call it?
23:30  bassliner: barathron: font size?
23:30 * barathron rolls his eyes 
23:30  barathron: nm
23:31  bassliner: barathron: look at e.g. gtk2, they will let you specify it for a variety of desktop parts. window manager titles, buttons, lists, textboxes, tooltips and so on.
23:31  bassliner: barathron: which completely makes sense.
23:34  barathron: bassliner: try this --> http://download.cnet.com/TinkerTool/3000-18487_4-19260.html?tag=vtredir
23:34  Branes: bara, I haven't had a crash in 8.6 in *years*. I have to punch OSX in the guts at least once a month.
23:34  barathron: Branes: I don't miss pre OS X at all myself
23:35  CEnTR4L: http://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/13/apples-share-of-computer-sales-surpasses-10-in-u-s/
23:35  Angostura: bassliner: USB Overdrive doesn't do it for you?
23:36  PigFlu: boot camp is possible the only thing i like on the mac
23:36  barathron: hmm begs the question: Why own a mac then? 
23:36  bassliner: Angostura: it does not work for trackpads. for mouse purposes, it perfectly works and does the job.
23:37  bassliner: barathron: i also tried tinkertool, that's why i explicitly mentioned the menu bar font.
23:38  barathron: bassliner: oh well, guess you're screwed :(
23:38  bassliner: barathron: and again, it gets you into serious problems, as aspects of the gui toolkit use absolute positioning of elements, e.g. the whole aqua gui acts on the assumption that things have a specific size. if you break the rules of the game, things will get unproportional.
23:38  PigFlu: lol post more gore
23:38  bassliner: barathron: oh i'm not.
23:38  PigFlu: wrong window.
23:39  bassliner: barathron: i'm very thankful for all your help and attempts to get me satisfied and such.
23:39  barathron: bassliner: I tried hehe
23:39  bassliner: barathron: which is very good and friendly and i'm thankful for it.
23:39  CEnTR4L: PigFlu, so you're one of those douchebags who hang around in these opposite/compete OS channel/forum to piss off the other guys?
23:39  CEnTR4L: Get lost and get a freaking life.
23:40  barathron: bassliner: seems there should be some way to do it 
23:41  bassliner: barathron: i'm just saying i tried for days and days and there's stuff that you just can't change, even not with third party apps, and that's exactly what i hate about macos. apart from that i love it, i use it, especially to make music, but also as a proprietary unix workstation, tho it will never ever give me the speed of workflow a linux machine gives me - again, because i can't define some aspects.
23:41  bassliner: barathron: if you find one, i'd be thankful for /msg and i will probably post the solution on my blog.
23:43  PigFlu: CEnTR4L: not really. i am truly trying to learn how2mac
23:43  Angostura: God is Pigflu still in the house?
23:43  bassliner: .oOo0(and i'd probably sell the 2 macs i have if macports didn't exist.)
23:45  bassliner: verpoler: großartiger nick.
23:45  barathron: bassliner: should I run across a solution I'd let ya know 
23:45  verpoler: hallo bassliner, ja finde ich auch :)
23:46  bassliner: verpoler: tho this is an english speaking chan i reckon hehe
23:46  Branes: http://www.9to5mac.com/30326/apple-event-back-to-the-mac-october-20th-macbooks -- Apple is resembling Kenya; Tigers and Leopards, now Lions, oh my!
23:46  barathron: ZFS in lion I wonder? 
23:47  Branes: No.
23:47  barathron: wonder what useless feature will be in store for us 
23:47  barathron: "YYour voice is your password" 
23:47  barathron: whatever happened to that? lol
23:47  Branes: I'm not *that* anal, bara :)
23:48  Branes: setec astronomy my arse :)
23:48  barathron: branes any idea what may be in Lion? 
23:48  Branes: New UI frameworks.
23:49  Branes: Much greater use of resolution independence.
23:49  Branes: (at long bloody last!)
23:49  barathron: so define your own arbitrary resolution?
23:50  Branes: Pretty much. Akin to how you can scale your entire UI with the Win7 interface.
23:50  barathron: gotcha
23:50 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
23:51  barathron: my big wish is 64bit for the FCP Suite 
23:51  barathron: taking forever :(
23:55  Angostura: Let's have a guess as to how many new features Apple will tout
23:56  Angostura: do I hear 200?
23:56  Angostura: 300?
23:58  barathron: 400!
23:58  ahihi: the one feature I'd like to see apple copy from windows (vista and above) is application-specific volume control
23:58  barathron: gotta beat last time
23:59  barathron: ahihi: application-specific volume control is possible isn't it? I have some aps that do that on OS X
