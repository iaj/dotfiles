00:36  stu_: hi, I want to add some more memory to my ibook g4
00:36  stu_: will a PC2700 SO-DIMM do the trick
00:37  stu_: the 'net is a little undecided on which ibook models support which standards
00:37  stu_: thanks in advance :)
00:37  brandFU: stu_: check in system profiler which kind of ram is supported
00:37 +richardcavell: yeah the computer will tell you
00:37  stu_: it says i have 256 built in
00:38  stu_: 133MHz FSB
00:38  Angostura: stu_: I tend to use the Crucial Web site - they have a handy little wizard
00:38 +richardcavell: what does it say exactly?
00:38  stu_: richardcavell: Memory: 256Mb. Bus Speed: 133MHz
00:38 +richardcavell: stu_: On my About this Mac, it gives me: 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM
00:39 +richardcavell: What does yours say?
00:39  stu_: it literally says Memory:256Mb
00:39  stu_: does Mac have /usr/sbin/lshw?
00:39  stu_: or something like that?
00:40  Angostura: stu_: Click System Profiler
00:40  Angostura: on the About This Mac pane
00:40  stu_: yeah
00:40  stu_: i have that open
00:40  stu_: and all it tells me is Memory: 256Mb
00:40  stu_: Bus Speed: 133MHz
00:40  Angostura: clicking on RAM?
00:40  Angostura: Sorry - Memory
00:41  stu_: yep, clicking on memory
00:41  stu_: tells me in DIMM0 I have built in 256Mb
00:41  stu_: and DIMM1 is empty
00:41  brandFU: stu_: what is the exact model of your ibook g4? what processor speed?
00:42  stu_: It is an ibook g4
00:42  stu_: CPU type PPC G4 1.2GHz
00:42  stu_: 1 CPU
00:42  stu_: L2 Cache: 512Kb
00:42  stu_: memory: 256Mb (built in)
00:42  stu_: BUS: 133MHz
00:43  stu_: Boot ROM Version 4.8.7f1
00:43  stu_: it has an airport card, firewire, ATI Graphics (32MB)
00:43  brandFU: stu_: what year?
00:43  stu_: and a 12" screen
00:43  brandFU: early 2004?
00:43  stu_: brandFU: no idea
00:44  stu_: is there a way of finding out?
00:44  brandFU: yes there is a free software called mactracker
00:44  brandFU: i have it open now. hold
00:45  Angostura: stu_: http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/MacOS.aspx
00:45  Angostura: Just grab that
00:45  stu_: from the files in /User/me the first entry is May 2005
00:45  brandFU: 1 slot: PC-2100 DDR266 200-pin SO-DIMM (PC-2700 supported; however it will run at only 266 MHz)
00:46  stu_: that's the conclusion i came to without the scanner
00:46  brandFU: so pc-2700 works
00:46  stu_: I'll give it a run and see what it says
00:46  brandFU: yeah
00:46  stu_: Yeah, I knew it was PC2100, but wasn't sure if it could deal with the PC2700 and just clock it down
00:46  brandFU: stu_: grab this software: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/5968/mactracker
00:47  brandFU: it says it will clock down
00:47  stu_: brandFU: that mactracker won't work, this is OSX10.3x
00:48  brandFU: whoa upgrade to leopard
00:48  stu_: may do one day, i want some more RAM first i think
00:49  Angostura: Upgrade to 10.4 at least
00:50  stu_: is there some massive difference?
00:50  stu_: brandFU: yes, crucial confirms PC2700 support
00:50 --- mikeplus16 is now known as mikeplus64
00:52  brandFU: yeah 10.4 and 10.5 are much faster
00:56  stu_: any idea what height the RAM should have
00:57  Mikael: seventeen megahertz.
00:57  brandFU: it's an SO-DIMM. IIRC they don't have different heights
00:57  brandFU: what he said
00:58  stu_: SO-DIMMS come in a couple of different sizes actually
00:58  stu_: there is about 1mm in it
00:58  stu_: so i would presume that 17MHz~=1.75mm which is the difference in the possible heights
00:59  brandFU: ah learned something new
00:59  stu_: :)
00:59  stu_: i presume that the hole is large enough for either
01:02  stu_: anyway, I'll order it, its only £30
01:03  stu_: if it doesn't work, ebay!
01:03  stu_: thanks brandFU richardcavell Angostura

01:09 +ChrisAM: you might be able to whip something up with Automator.
01:10  brandFU: falcom: i saw an app for this on macupdate but can't recall the name. so yes such an app exists
01:13  brandFU: falcom: have you had a look at optimal layout? http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33629/optimal-layout
01:14  brandFU: there's also mercury mover: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26411/mercurymover
01:15  falcom: just checked optimal .. works :)
01:18  falcom: brandFU: mercury seem to be the app i really want. and ouch the price
01:18  brandFU: heh :D
01:19  falcom: are you familiar with osx app dev? do you know how much work to take to make a clone of it?
01:19  brandFU: no idea

08:01  Zambz: hey just, what's your favourite music player and video player on OSX?  Does everyone just use iTunes and Quicktime (with Perian) / VLC?  Really struggling to move from my foobar2000 and GOM Player on Windows which i much prefer to the Apple / VLC apps
08:03  tntc: Zambz: worst case, you might be able to get foobar2000 to run in Wine.
08:03  LSD`: I use iTunes for audio mostly because it was there, but also because of the iPhone and realising it can do a few things better than most everything else I've tried (in that order). As for video, mostly Front Row front-ending QuickTime+Perian with VLC being dragged out for when I can't be bothered loading that all up for one video or song
08:07  Zambz: tntc & LSD`: thanks guys
08:07  Zambz: my biggest gripes with iTunes are:
08:08  Zambz: - Inability to play some tunes without adding them to your library
08:08  Zambz: - The way playlists are implemented, should be possible to view your playlist and library at the same time and easily see what's going on
08:08  Zambz: :)
08:08  cryptics_: turn off the bloody awful organising
08:08  cryptics_: next
08:08  Zambz: any way aronud those?
08:08  LSD`: My single biggest gripe with iTunes, after whittling them all down, is its insistence on treating your main library as one giant playlist
08:08  Zambz: yeah that's true, but it still adds it to the library
08:09  cryptics_: double click the playlist and it will open in a new window
08:09  Zambz: LSD`: yep, exactly
08:09  Zambz: foobar2000 is way more easygoing, you have a "main" playlist and more if you want them
08:09  Zambz: and if you drag & drop into the playlist, it just plays them, no touching the library
08:09  Zambz: know what i mean?
08:09  Zambz: i just wish i could do those things in itunes :( it's way too restricted
08:10  tntc: Zambz: my gripes with iTunes are numerous, but my biggest annoyance lately has more to do with my iPod. Namely, that mp3s that played fine on my droid and in iTunes, and transferred fine, would not play on my iPod classic.
08:10  LSD`: I'd rather have a library and playlists treated seperately, and something akin to the app selection system for when you're checking songs to go onto your iPod or whatever
08:10  tntc: I had to convert them to AAC.
08:10  Zambz: tntc: very strange! :(
08:10  Zambz: tntc: i have an idea you can try, perhaps try removing all metadata in the files (tags) and see if that helps
08:11  Zambz: LSD`: precisely, that's what i want
08:11  tntc: Zambz: yeah, I ran the iTunes metadata fixer thinger on it, same deal
08:11  LSD`: Having to uncheck a bunch of songs because they won't fit on your iDevice means they won;t play in any kind of sequence through the main library at all. "So use playlists" you say, except when you only have a few dozen that won't fit (out of a couple of thousand), that's annoying
08:11  Zambz: LSD`: of course the ability to add library tunes to a playlist is all good, but playlists should be able to have tunes outside your library
08:11  tntc: I had to convert them to AAC.
08:11  Zambz: tntc: very strange, and that happens to all mp3s you have?
08:11  tntc: Zambz: nope. Random ones.
08:11  tntc: Zambz: they're all converted already.  Whole library. 
08:12  tntc: Took a while, but it wasn't too bad.
08:12  Zambz: tntc: hamn, because don't forget you'll lose quality when doing that
08:12  Zambz: be sure to keep the mp3s
08:12  Zambz: lose "further" quality i should say
08:12  tntc: Zambz: meh. Not enough to matter to me.  I compared several, and couldn't tell the difference.
08:12  Zambz: lol
08:12  Zambz: cool :)
08:12  LSD`: tntc: I've never had that happen that I recall. I've had iTunes reject certain files, but never the iPod. Hell, that's one of the reasons I grew to hate iTunes less: when iTunes supports something (like Unicode filenames or metadata), it's a safe bet iPods do too
08:13  Zambz: oh itunes is unicode compliant?
08:13  Zambz: that's neat
08:13  Zambz: i only have english tunes anyway so meh
08:13  Zambz: lol
08:13  tntc: LSD`: I was suprised, to say the leas.t  Maybe it was a weirdly encoded file or something.
08:14  Zambz: i think it might of been tntc, tags most likely i would of thought
08:14  LSD`: Zambz: A large chunk of my collection has japanese characters either in the filenames. Windows Media Player choked on them (at least under XP, haven't been game enough to see how they go on 7...), but iTunes handles them fine
08:14  LSD`: in the filenames or metadata*
08:15  Zambz: aaah interesting
08:15  Zambz: and so for video, i use gom player on windows, best thing about it are the shortcut keys and really easy playlist management
08:15  Zambz: i find quicktime incredibly bad in terms of shortcuts
08:15  Zambz: do you guys mainly rely on it or VLC? are there any other good alternative video players on mac?
08:16  Zambz: i tend to mainly play AVI files, DivX and whatnot
08:16  Kasm279: Zambz: grab Perian
08:16  Zambz: yeah i have mate
08:16  Zambz: but you still have to use Quicktime with the terrible shortcuts
08:16  Zambz: :(
08:17  LSD`: I just use Front Row since the only time I really watch video on my Mac (outside of inline video on websites) it's when I'm away and watching stuff in bed with the MacBook propped up on the side table. I seriously wish all this HTPC software would get over its allergy to sequential playback >_<
08:17  Zambz: e.g. in GOM Player, I use -> and <- to rewind and ffwd, + to zoom in, space to pause / play, enter to full screen, there are even shortcuts for fixing audio sync
08:17  Zambz: LSD`: aaah i see lol :) nice
08:18  Zambz: GOM Player also has the ability to play incomplete downloaded files, so i can watch while I download
08:18  Zambz: these are the main things keeping me from OSX  really, foobar2000, GOM Player and Exact Audio Copy, seems that OSX has onthing even close to them :(
08:18  LSD`: It can't seriously be that hard to check what the next file in a folder is and start playing it right off the bad when the first one finishes
08:19  Zambz: LSD`: I'm guessing you have a remote though?
08:20  LSD`: Yeah, but that requires hunting around for it, often in the dark, just to press two buttons. The PS3 can do this, I don't see why it's so hard for everyone else.
08:21  Zambz: ya
08:21  Zambz: i'm not a bed tv watching kinda dude, my brother is though
08:21  Zambz: i tend to just watch stuff on my pc
08:21  Zambz: pretty lame heheh :)
08:23  londonmet050: when ever I come out of sleep
08:24  londonmet050: my mbp shows artifacts on screen
08:24  londonmet050: but switching back to nvidia solves it
08:24  londonmet050: is it a way I can update intel drivers
08:25  LSD`: Under OS X? Not really.
08:25  londonmet050: so I have to go to mac genius
08:26  londonmet050: could be my on board card failure or is it snow leopard
08:26  londonmet050: I did run tech tools
08:26  londonmet050: no hard ware problems
08:26  BobbyJr: more likely a hardware issue, especially since switching to nvidia seems to solve it for you.
08:27  londonmet050: ok
08:27  londonmet050: I might visit one day apple store
08:27  londonmet050: if it gets worst
08:28  Zambz: oh guys, just one more question if i may
08:28  Zambz: what archiver do you use?
08:30  BobbyJr: I use the built in archiver for normal zip files etc, but rar's are usually handled by either StuffIt or UnrarX (because it also has par support)
08:31  Zambz: aaah yep
08:31  Zambz: any good apps to create RARs in OSX?
08:31  Zambz: i just find zip to be significantly inferior as a format and prefer not to use it
08:31  BobbyJr: StuffIt's full package can create them, as can packages like BetterZip
08:32  Zambz: nice one, i have tried Betterzip and thought that was decent
08:32  Zambz: I keep reading Stuffit is too bloated so i never tried it
08:32  Zambz: is it any good?
08:32  BobbyJr: Its ok, to be honest I only have it around just in case
08:32  Zambz: aah yea
08:32  BobbyJr: most of the time Im in UnrarX, the built in one or BetterZip on occasion if Im creating archives
08:33  Zambz: aah yeah, makes sense
08:33  BobbyJr: Im also a closet Winrar fan too :P
08:33  Zambz: here's the best OSX apps I found while playing with my brother's iMac for a few months (he let me borrow it)
08:33  Zambz: http://users.on.net/~djbros/macapps.txt
08:33  Zambz: yeah i bought WinRAR on PC, and really rRREALALLLLYY love it
08:33  Zambz: these are the sorts of apps that are making it impossible for me to switch :)
08:34  Zambz: ill brb mate, dinner time, have a read of that app list if you like, you might find some useful
08:34  Zambz: if you want to know what any of them do, just shout out, ill be back in about 15
08:34  Zambz: peace
08:34  Zambz: :D
08:34  BobbyJr: haha no no, I'd never go back to using Windows as a full time OS. OSX rules in every way I need. I keep Windows around for the odd gaming session or for the occasional tool that absolutely needs it.
08:35  BobbyJr: I'm having a read of it now :)
08:40  Fedayk1n: I just use unarchiver
08:40  Fedayk1n: works great

14:39  AntORG: hfs+ is a journaling filesystem, but that doesn't really has anything to do with fragmentation. it's about the integrity of the filesystem and the allocation of files
14:41  tehbaut: so is it possible that some files might be damaged or not really even there at all, yet still show up in the finder?
14:41  AntORG: that's not how it works
14:41  AntORG: let me make an simple example
14:42  AntORG: you write some files, operation is done, commit command follows the operation
14:42  AntORG: only if the commit command is issued the files are actually "there"
14:42  AntORG: at least for the file system
14:42  AntORG: a non-journaling file system, issues the commit command while it's writing the files to the drive
14:43  AntORG: so in case of a blackout, the commit might have already happened but the files aren't there
14:43  AntORG: =corrupt file system
14:43  tehbaut: ok, I'm with you there... but I guess that's not where I'm concerned here, so I'll explain a bit more detail
14:44  AntORG: k

14:49  AntORG: I'm not 100% sure but I think dd works block-for-block, so there are probably a lot of corrupted or partially copied files and unfortunately I don't think you can do anything about it.
14:50  tehbaut: but is there a way to locate or analyze which files are indeed corrupt?
14:51  AntORG: try fsck on linux
14:53  AntORG: it might even recover some partial files and put them in lost+found
14:54  tehbaut: I started to try that, but it gave me a message "volume is journaled" and stopped ...so I didn't want to take any chances destroying any data, though I do have a second backup just in case I were to mess something up... I just wanted to look into it further first
14:56  AntORG: never tried to mount hfs+ on linux, what driver do you use for that? is it reliable?
14:56  tehbaut: I had to install hfsprogs, but it seems to work alright normally
14:57  tehbaut: I can see what I believe might be all the original files when I mount the partial copy partition, but just not sure if the files are really all there or not
14:58  tehbaut: at least nothing appears to be missing in action

16:36  Lashknife: hi all
16:36  Lashknife: few days ago i joined about a mbp not being able to boot from dvd
16:37  Lashknife: read a bit and concluded that it refused booting a 10.6.0
16:37  Lashknife: actually it boots but then hangs on loading mkext stuff
16:37  Lashknife: 2 lines of dots and done
16:37  Lashknife: now i read that there could be issues if you install/boot from a version older version than the book came with
16:38  Lashknife: so i got me a 10.6.3
16:38  Lashknife: same thing
16:38  Lashknife: now when i insert a windows 7 (no bootcamp, straigth boot from dvd) that boots fine
16:38  Lashknife: the current osx installed works fine
16:38  Lashknife: but i wanted to clear that out factory level so...
16:38  Lashknife: any clues on how to fix this?
16:43  TheNavyBear: UGH! It snowed again!
16:43  Lashknife: omg omg omg
16:44  Lashknife: overlooked an update from apple itself that exactly describes this issue
16:44  Lashknife: roflmao
16:44  Lashknife: thank you mac
16:44  Lashknife: good thing i didnt format it with that win7 to check stuff

17:18  Zed`: ohai mac gais - got a new Air here - no MS Office products will run - they crash immediatly - they were working fine for weeks - I already deleted the plist files and reset parameter ram - I can't even run the MS installer or MS Update - My google foo is failing me - any ideas?
17:25  Al2O3: Anyone buying a MacBook Air is stupid.
17:26 +zer0her0: poor al203
17:27 +zer0her0: Zed`: i don't use any MSO stuff sorry
17:28  Zed`: Al2O3: no u
17:28  Zed`: wird stuff
17:28  Zed`: even created a new account
17:28 +zer0her0: which version of OS X?
17:28  Zed`: 10.5.6
17:29  adamfield: updating to 10.5.8 at the least might help
17:29  Zed`: user said she did not install any software at all
17:29  Zed`: hrm ok
17:29 +zer0her0: um you're running 10.5.6 on a new Air?
17:29 * zer0her0 blinks
17:30 * zer0her0 wonders if he went back in time in his sleep.
17:30  Zed`: software update says the machine is up to date
17:31  adamfield: O.o
17:33 +zer0her0: Zed`: it's a new 11/13" Air running 10.5.x?!?
17:34  S_SubZero: i dont think that would even properly install.
17:34  Zed`: yeah, weird I just ran software update again and it is showing the updates
17:34  adamfield: Zed`: if thats the case, take it to the apple store.
17:34  adamfield: oh wait. updates = good
17:34  adamfield: get snowkitty on there
17:34  Zed`: heh
17:34  Zed`: Yeah I am doing the updates now, l;et's see what happens
17:35  Zed`: who knows what the user did, she said "nothing's changed"
17:35  Zed`: thanks, tho gais
17:36 +zer0her0: haha
17:36 +zer0her0: i'm reading Apple's new white paper for IT about empowering users
17:36 +zer0her0: and this is EXACTLY what i'd fear
17:36 +ChrisAM: heh
17:36 +ChrisAM: I'm glad I don't deal with users anymore.
17:38 +zer0her0: ChrisAM: yea, i've finally got this dept under control
17:38 +zer0her0: only took 2.5 years
17:38 +ChrisAM: hehe
17:38  Zed`: we're not even a mac shop
17:38  Zed`: but of course lots of folks have them
17:38  Zed`: me included ;)
17:39 +zer0her0: yea technically we aren't either
17:39 +zer0her0: hence why i'm in charge of them and read all the white papers and such in regards to them
17:39 +ChrisAM: your company allows you to put your mac on their network?
17:39 * zer0her0 is technically a media artist
17:39 +ChrisAM: is that a step up from starving artist?
17:40 +zer0her0: 50k step up.
17:40 +ChrisAM: that's what... 3 months rent in NYC? :P
17:41 +zer0her0: haha
17:41 +zer0her0: when i was working in NYC i'd make 60k in 3 months, so yea that sounds about right
17:43  Zed`: so, 10.6.6 is not snowketteh?
17:43  Zed`: it won't upgrade past 10.6.6
17:43 +ChrisAM: 10.6.6 is the latest.
17:43  Zed`: ah, ok
17:43 +ChrisAM: You said 10.5.6 earlier
17:43 +zer0her0: ah
17:43  Zed`: right
17:44  Zed`: now it is 10.6.6
17:44 +zer0her0: typo, that makes more sense
17:44 +zer0her0: Zed`: there is no way you could have gone from 10.5.6 to 10.6.6 via software update
17:44  Zed`: agreed
17:44 +ChrisAM: It was magic!
17:44 +ChrisAM: don't question it
17:44  Zed`: well in any case the OS is patched to latest
17:45  Zed`: and no office products will run
17:45  Zed`: not even ms update
17:45  Zed`: :/
17:45  Zed`: or the 2008 installer
17:45 +ChrisAM: hmm
17:46 +ChrisAM: I've never attempted to install MS Office on my mac... sorry.
17:46  pgpkeys: morning ChrisAM (well morning for someone just waking up)
17:46 +zer0her0: Zed`: you remove all the stuff from /Library/Application Support/Microsoft
17:46 +ChrisAM: pgpkeys ... I've been up for 3 hours and I'm still waking up.
17:46  pgpkeys: ahh and zer0her0 
17:46  Zed`: I deleted the entire directory
17:46  pgpkeys: ChrisAM: hehe
17:47 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: allo
17:47  pgpkeys: o/
17:49  pgpkeys: ChrisAM: working the first cup of coffee of the day. waiting for macports to finish installing some stuff. I tried to get it to install to /usr/local and they have it hard coded not to allow that. told ya i was finding certain things difficult coming from linux and freebsd. thats where we install additional system software.
17:50  adamfield: pgpkeys: doesnt homebrew correct that?
17:51 +ChrisAM: yeah... /opt/local is a more common place on the mac for stuff like that.
17:51  pgpkeys: adamfield: yeah but there are FAR more packages available under macports than homebrew
17:51  pgpkeys: ChrisAM: yeah found that out the hard way hehe
17:51  adamfield: pgpkeys: i use macports, but devs i work with swear by brew
17:51  pgpkeys: adamfield: nothing wrong with either of them. just mentioning that there are far more packages with MP than HB is all
17:52  pgpkeys: i've used both
17:52 +ChrisAM: I stopped using MacPorts & the like.
17:52 +ChrisAM: Anything I need from them, I'll just SSH to one of my linux boxes and do it there.
17:52  pgpkeys: ChrisAM: any particular reason?
17:52  adamfield: i figure disk is cheap
17:52  adamfield: so why not just have the ports local
17:52 +ChrisAM: less crud on my mac that way.
17:52  pgpkeys: ahh. see i run ruby version manager (rvm) and multiple ruby versions so for me i need it
17:53  adamfield: i just upgraded my MBP to the 500GB momentus XT... i have no need for 500GB on my laptop
17:53  adamfield: so, why not fill it with crud!
17:53  pgpkeys: haha
17:53 +ChrisAM: I fill my 500GB disk with music
17:53 +ChrisAM: I have 22472 songs (105.13 GB in size) in my iTunes library.
17:53  adamfield: thats what the home media server is for
17:53  adamfield: any music i need with me, is ont he iphone
17:54 +ChrisAM: Can't take my home media server with me when I travel or go to work.
17:54  adamfield: rsync is a wonderful thing ;)
17:54  pgpkeys: due to my limited cash flow I'm ding a single upgrade a month for the next few months. next month is 4GB RAM, following month a new battery, and the next one after that a 500GB 7200rpm drive
17:54  pgpkeys: adamfield: can't live without my git and rsync :)
17:54  adamfield: pgpkeys: get the momentus XT
17:54  pgpkeys: adamfield: whats the damage?
17:54  adamfield: way faster than the 7200rpm i had
17:54  adamfield: 89$
17:54  pgpkeys: huh. that a hybrid drive or something?
17:55  adamfield: and the SSD hybrid sexiness of it
17:55  pgpkeys: nm, i'll google

17:57  adamfield: the air is all i need. great batterylife, and portable enough for my commute
17:57  pgpkeys: so its not just a matter of getting 'a job'
17:57  adamfield: pro = overkill
17:57  Zed`: wow - can't even run the Office 2004 11.6.2 Update - instant crash

18:16  MrUnagi: battery life is horrible =/
18:17 +ChrisAM: agreed
18:17 +ChrisAM: but I like the functionality
18:17  MrUnagi: i mean, on paper, 4 hours continuous screen on use is awesome
18:17  MrUnagi: but in practice, i dread checking my stocks
18:17 +ChrisAM: If I was away from a power source for longer, I'd get the extended battery
18:18  MrUnagi: i can only do the 1950 battery because i use a car dock
18:18 +ChrisAM: at work, I just leave it on USB
18:18  MrUnagi: yea my usb cable broke and i cant seem to locate a quality one
18:18  MrUnagi: i have gone through 6
18:18  pgpkeys: belkin!
18:18  pgpkeys: i've yet to successfuly destroy a belkin cable
18:19  MrUnagi: it seems those claws are touchy
18:19  MrUnagi: and lifting up on them with a thumbtack seems to cause data connection issues
18:19  pgpkeys: hehe metal to metal. ya think? ;)
18:20  MrUnagi: no no no not while it is plugged in
18:20  MrUnagi: the claws flatten out so that the cable doesnt stay in, so i lift on them with a tack to bend them upward, and somehow that makes the contact with the data leads deminish
18:20  MrUnagi: doesnt make sense to me
18:23  pgpkeys: huh. coul dbe cause of the connection using the internal edge of the metal rather than the outer casing
18:24  pgpkeys: aka electrical contact requirements being to use the inner side of the metal sleeve for contact, not the outer side
18:24  pgpkeys: (every side has 2 sides)
18:24  pgpkeys: so when you bend the metal with the thumbtack you would actually BE diluting your contact
18:24  MrUnagi: =/
18:25  MrUnagi: are you still talking about a micro b cable
18:25  MrUnagi: these arent to my knowledge contact leads
18:25  MrUnagi: theyre just to hold the cable in place
18:25  pgpkeys: idk if they are or not
18:25  MrUnagi: that would make it a 7 pin usb cable =/

20:10  Angostura: If not iWeb take a look at Freeway
20:11  MobGod: Angostura freeway 
20:11  Angostura: Freeway

20:12  Angostura: Talking of Web design, where might I find some helpful Web geeks. I'm trying to debug a site that renders fine in Safari on Mac and iPhone, but where the layout goes to pants on an iPad
20:14  MrUnagi: yo
20:15  MobGod: Angostura I don't have 250 dollars lol 
20:16  ksmith1: hey guys
20:16  MobGod: sup MrUnagi 
20:16  ksmith1: I'm having troubles with my wireless connection
20:16  MrUnagi: the sky
20:17  ksmith1: every now and then I have to wait ages for a page to load.
20:17  MobGod: I hope so 
20:17  ksmith1: but it's only happening when I'm online via the wireless connection. when I'm using the ethernet port everything's working fine.
20:18  MrUnagi: ksmith1: interference
20:18 +crilly: MobGod: Text Wrangler and an XHTML reference textbook
20:18  ksmith1: MrUnagi: my girlfriends laptop doesn't have any problems.
20:19  MrUnagi: faulty airport?
20:19  ksmith1: what do you mean by that?
20:19  MrUnagi: wireless card might bebad?
20:19  MrUnagi: what kind of laptop is hers
20:20  ksmith1: a samsung.
20:20  MrUnagi: does it have wireless n or g
20:20  ksmith1: I don't know
20:20 * MrUnagi facepalms
20:23  ksmith1: yes ..
20:27  ksmith1: I'm quite sure it's a problem with OSX as it's fine when I'm booted into Win7
20:27  MrUnagi: ksmith1: reinstall os x
20:27  Necrosan: What is your issue ksmith1 ?
20:27  Necrosan: and my advice is to reset your preferences
20:27  Necrosan: after a quick scan of your issue
20:28  ksmith1: Necrosan: the internet stops responding periodically.
20:29  ksmith1: every now and then all pages stop loading. it lasts for about 1 minute or 2.
20:29  Necrosan: Try to do a reset
20:29  Necrosan: Are you updated all the way? to 10.6.6?
20:29  ksmith1: what preferences do you mean exactly?
20:29  Necrosan: What kind of Mac is this?
20:29  ksmith1: yep
20:29  Necrosan: We need to know more.
20:29  ksmith1: black macbook.
20:29  MrUnagi: im not even on 10.6.6 lol
20:30  Necrosan: OK. Open terminal while in OSX, and run a sudo dmesg
20:30  Necrosan: see if any obvious errors are appearing
20:30  Necrosan: Check the strangely titled log viewer named "Console.app" for logs that point to problems
20:30  Necrosan: Problems USUALLY don't manifest themselves without error messages of this type
20:32  ksmith1: well, well ... there are plenty of logs to scan.
20:32  ksmith1: I don't really know what to look for, though.
20:36  MrUnagi: i would start with errors
20:41  ksmith1: there are hundreds of error messages ...
20:47  ksmith1: I've got something like "mDNSResponder[18]: Closing vnic1 BPF fd 28 due to error 6 (Device not configured)"
20:49  Necrosan: yeah
20:49  Necrosan: You need to reinstall OSX, ksmith1
20:49  Necrosan: Something messed you up nice
20:49  ksmith1: or mDNSResponder[18]: mDNSPlatformReceiveBPF_fd: 87 vmnet8 BIOCSETIF failed 6 (Device not configured)
20:50  ksmith1: well, that's just not an option.
20:50  Necrosan: those are from parallels/vmware
20:50  ksmith1: I don't have any of those running
20:50  Necrosan: Why is that not an option?
20:50  Necrosan: They embed themselves within the OS
20:50  ksmith1: because I don't have enough space to do a backup.
20:51  Necrosan: If there are "100s of errors" something is not right
20:51  Necrosan: Something messed you up real nice
20:52  ksmith1: well, the dock is giving me the same error over and over again
20:53  TheNavyBear: WOW! TechTool Pro 5 is much nicer then TechTool Pro 4....
20:53  ksmith1: illustrator, too and chrome has an issue with some image from DivX
20:53  ksmith1: basically they're making up 99% of the errors

23:12  Angostura: MobGod: I mentioned Freeway earlier - the Express version would be fine for your needs - does not cost $200+ - FYI
23:14  MobGod: Angostura how much
23:15  Angostura: Can't remember 60ish, I think
23:16  MobGod: Angostura is rapidweaver better
23:19  menace40: ffs just fork out for dreamwever the alternatives are SHIT 
23:21  MobGod: menace40 do i want the one with mysql and php or just the reg onbe
23:21  MobGod: one*
23:21  Angostura: MobGod: RapidWeaver is a bit less polished than Freeway, IMHO
23:22  menace40: well to me it wouldent matter id just pull sql and php scripts off codebases and furums 
23:22  Angostura: Dreamweaver's fine, but it's really better for people who want to do most work in codeview, IMHO
23:23  MobGod: ok so if i'm learning i should stick with iweb for now until i get better correct
23:23  menace40: Angostura NONONO dreamweaver is great for both it has the BEST wsywig out there and the coe view is great too 
23:24  menace40: MobGod if i were you id do your first sight in text edit or emacs the use an editer that way you will know how the code works XD 
23:24  Angostura: menace40: In your opinion. In my opinion, it's not so good for building graphic designs using WYSIWYG mode
23:25  Angostura: MobGod: You'd probably best build your motherboard by hand too
23:25  menace40: Angostura you use it on its own or with PS/AI ? 
23:28  Angostura: On it's own
23:28  menace40: nah its only good with a design tool too 
23:28  Angostura: We agree
23:28  MobGod: memecake so u suggest i get dreamweaver ?
23:28  Angostura: I don't think MobGod is going to be forking out for PS or AI to go with Dreamweaver, hence my suggestion of Freeway
23:28  menace40: he could use it with pixolmator and vectordesigner 
23:28  menace40: OR theres always kompozor its one of the better wsiwgs iv worked with  and its free 
23:30  menace40: http://kompozer.net/
