14:39  dxtr: Okay, screw this shit. My new macbook is officially my most unstable piece of hardware I've owned for the last ten years. Wtf is wrong?
14:40  dxtr: Flash crashes the web browser, I can't start Opera or Adium, iTunes crashed when I want to quit it
14:41  js_: dxtr: bad memory perhaps?
14:42  js_: my macbook is the most stable piece of hardware i've got, never experienced something like that
14:49 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
14:49  dxtr: js_: could it possible be that it doesn't like the memory I put in it?
14:50  js_: dxtr: i've heard of instability issues due to that, yeah
14:50  dxtr: Shit crap
14:50  js_: with that said, i've tried two different memory types in mine, from going from 2>4 and 4>8
14:50  js_: now i use crucial
14:51  js_: extremely stable
14:51  js_: with the 4gb memory it was less stable, but good enough
14:52  dxtr: Then I'll buy that
14:52 +Tomis: as long as you don't buy bargain basement ram you should be fine
14:52 +Tomis: did you run the extended hardware test from your system DVD?
14:53 +Tomis: it will test the system's memory
14:53  dxtr: No, I was planning on doing that in a couple of minutes
14:53  dxtr: js_: What do you mean?

15:06  DEMNVT: Hey guys... does anyone in here know if there is a good channel for Final Cut Pro discussions?
15:06  js_: dxtr: when a lot of ram was used, i could experience that the whole desktop just crashed and restarted
15:07  js_: dxtr: might be something with osx memory management as well, all i know is everything is 100% stable now that i have 8gb ram :)
15:08 +Tomis: i doubt it had to do with os x memory management
15:08 +Tomis: using up all your ram just means you start paging like hell and system performance goes to crap
15:09  DEMNVT: Yup... paging = bad :S
15:29  Kasm279|Away: js_: crucial is the btand to get :D
15:36  rryouumaa: i rely on zooming, where i hold down the ctrl key and the mouse wheel zooms the display.  today that feature broke.  i can zoom in, but if i move the mouse up even a pixel or two, zooming gets stuck at the top of the screen and doesn't move vertically any more.
15:37  rryouumaa: rebooting doesn't help and i tried different zooming options
15:37  rryouumaa: (i realize you're probably all asleep now and i'm talking into the ether)
15:38  torchie: nop
15:38  torchie: got an anthropology test in an hour
15:39  Kasm279|Away: rryouumaa: i just wokr up
15:39  Kasm279|Away: woke
15:43  MobGod: morning all 
16:00  rryouumaa: hi
16:05 +Branes: rryouumaa: Do the usual - boot off your OSX install DVD (or any other bootable volume) and run Disk Utility, then use it to do a Repair Disk then a Repair Permissions. Alternatively, install AppleJack, boot into single user mode, and at the prompt type 'applejack AUTO restart'
16:06  rryouumaa: Branes: well, i guess this means i need to try to come across tiger disks.  long gone.
16:06  rryouumaa: is applejack an apple thing?
16:06  rryouumaa: think the problem i described is hw?  sw?
16:06 +Tomis: check the zoom settings in system prefs rryouumaa ?
16:07 +Tomis: sounds like the software borking up
16:07  Pyista42: core i5 good enough? or shouldi  really get the i7? hmm
16:07  rryouumaa: Tomis: i tried that.  changing them does not help
16:08 +Branes: rryouumaa: http://applejack.sourceforge.net/ <- it is an independent, free set of self-running maintenance scripts. Highly recommended. Don't get v1.6 though, that's for OSX 10.6 only.
16:09  rryouumaa: ok, thanks.  i like that better.
16:11 +Tomis: which machine Pyista42 
16:12  Pyista42: macbook pro 15 i5 or i7 in the 15 inch 
16:13 +Tomis: well that's a $400 difference
16:13 +Tomis: between the base model an the i7
16:14 +Tomis: i'd check the benchmarks on geekbench to determine if the performance increase is really worth $400
16:14 +Tomis: note also it's not just a matter of i5 vs. i7, but also taking into account the other spec differences between those machines
16:15  theworkpatrol: yep the proc difference is abou 150 of that money
16:15  rryouumaa: on the off chance that the problem is a bad hd, are there places in /var/log or someplace i can look to see if there have been any disk errors?
16:16 +Tomis: screen zoom being wack, i wouldn't attribute to a disk error rryouumaa 
16:16  rryouumaa: oh -- just noticed something that happened at the same time.  the laptop's display is showing a black line at the top
16:16  Pyista42: Tomis: do you think its worth it?
16:16  Pyista42: will i be able to tell a difference? hmm
16:17 +Tomis: i don't think it's $400 worth it, no Pyista42 
16:17  rryouumaa: the mouse only goes up to the black line
16:17 +Tomis: but as i said, check the geekbench comparison
16:17  rryouumaa: Branes: i'm guessing this new information might be a hint?
16:17 +Tomis: it's really a % performance difference issue in my mind
16:17 +Tomis: if there's only a 10% increase, is that worth $400? a %35 increase? etc.
16:17  rryouumaa: oh wait, that's a display resolution thing maybe i can fix directly
16:18  Pyista42: Tomis: the i7 at the store seemed pretty quick but it was in the imac 27
16:20 +Tomis: yea Pyista42 , it's also 800Mhz or so faster overall than then base 15" MBP
16:21  Pyista42: seems like quite a bit actually heh 
16:21 +Tomis: pint being, i think that MHz difference is the bigger factor there than the i5/i7 difference
16:22  Pyista42: i think the i7 uses a different architecture too doesn't it ?
16:27 +Branes: rryouumaa: That could be either a hardware fault, or something wrong with the video drivers.
16:27 +Branes: rryouumaa: Applejack your machine, and then begin the quest for your OSX installer disc(s), you /may/ need to re-install.
16:27 +Tomis: screen zooming has had various bugs at time in my experience
16:27 +Tomis: so i wouldn't put too much stock in just screen zoom beign weird
16:28 +Tomis: if the machine exibits other odd behavior, then i'd start to be worried
16:33  rryouumaa: it was just a change in resolution
16:34  rubydiamond: Which site will give me latest prices of Macbook Pro RAM/memory 4GB / 8GB
16:34  Tu13es: store.apple.com
16:35 +Tomis: newegg.com rubydiamond 
16:35  Tu13es: oh
16:35 +Tomis: i wouldn't buy ram/hd from apple ever
16:35  Tu13es: misread
16:35  Tu13es: yeah
16:35  rubydiamond: Tomis: what to search there
16:35 +Tomis: unless you like overpaying
16:35 +Tomis: go to he memry section, laptop memory rubydiamond 
16:35 +Tomis: DDR3 is the speed
16:35  rubydiamond: which company should I go for
16:35  rubydiamond: any recommended RAM company
16:35 +Tomis: doesnt matter
16:36  rubydiamond: hmm
16:36 +Tomis: look at the ratings
16:36  rubydiamond: really :)
16:36 +Tomis: that'll give you a better idea
16:36  rubydiamond: okay
16:36  rubydiamond: Tomis: what is the starting price for 2GB Ram
16:36  rubydiamond: that you know
16:36 +Tomis: i wouldn't go with less than 4GB total
16:36 +Tomis: what's the machine have in it now?
16:37  rubydiamond: Tomis: yeah I mean the same 2GB + 2GB
16:37  bzinger: how can i tell program to properly "close" itself,  e.g every time i quite vim, its content will be still visible from terminal's output, i want it to clear its content once vim is close
16:37  rubydiamond: I have macbook pro 13" 
16:38 +Tomis: close the window bzinger ?
16:38  rubydiamond: Tomis: does newegg.com ship free in india ?
16:38  rubydiamond: :)
16:38  bzinger: I'm using vim in commandline/Terminal 
16:39 +Tomis: i doubt it rubydiamond 
16:39  rubydiamond: hmm
16:39  rubydiamond: it's like $180 in India for 2GB + 2GB
16:39  rubydiamond: quite costly
16:40 +Tomis: yea but where are you going
16:41  bzinger: Tomis: do you have other solutions for my problem?
16:41 +Tomis: no idea bzinger , sorry, maybe someone with more shell experience will come in and help
16:41  rubydiamond: Tomis: looks like I am going to buy 
16:41  rubydiamond: :)
16:45  Pyista42: Tomis: is it stupid to buy a macbook pro right now? i dont want the new 15 or 17's to be obsolete next week?
16:45 +Tomis: at this point i'd probably hold off
16:45 +Tomis: google "mac buyer's guide" check what the recomendation is
16:46  szpuni: hey all
16:46 +Tomis: i got my i5 15" back in sept, couldn't wait anymore
16:47  szpuni: do anybody have some guide howto run custom scripts in os x 10.6?
16:47  szpuni: i need to run some program on screen session not in deamon mode
16:47 +Tomis: define "custom scripts", that can mean so many things
16:47  szpuni: some software which i wrote by my self
16:48 +Tomis: ah shell scripts, that's a bit beyond me
16:48  szpuni: python scripts acctually
16:49  szpuni: i just need something which will start with scritpt i need to start anything even TOP like that screen -S something -d -m myscript
16:50  szpuni: launchd do not want to run anything like that
16:57  rryouumaa: just wondering: how quickly are macs getting faster in throughput?  what's the doubling rate these days?
16:57  rryouumaa: i mean everything except disk, i.e. memory speed, cpu speed, maybe bus speed if it is a bottleneck
16:58 +Tomis: same as PCs really rryouumaa 
16:58 +Tomis: sometimes apple has the cutting-edge chips, sometimes they're behind for a while
16:58  Marctraider: rryouumaa: Like any other pc using the same hardware
17:00  rryouumaa: which is to say... (has been a while for me)
17:00  rryouumaa: ?
17:00  Marctraider: Quite fast.
17:00  Marctraider: But harddisks will always be the limiting factor.
17:00  rryouumaa: but not at moore's law rates anymore, right?
17:00  Marctraider: Mhh there you say something... I dont know actually
17:01 +Tomis: moore's observation is still in affect, yes rryouumaa 
17:01  rryouumaa: doubling every 1.5?

17:12  webPragmatist: if osx is such an amazing operating system… why can't i use the back button in a save dialog?
17:13 +Tomis: whats the back button
17:13  webPragmatist: swipe left on my mouse i suppose
17:13  webPragmatist: so backspace maybe as a keyboard shortcut
17:13 +Tomis: backspace would be delete
17:13  webPragmatist: right whatever
17:13 +Tomis: and i find it stupid to use it as a navigational shortcut
17:14 +Tomis: as they do in safari for god-knows what reason
17:14  webPragmatist: well… this is digressing
17:14  webPragmatist: a swipe on the trackpad
17:14 +Tomis: that's a lack of adding support for fancy new crap they've added to the OS really
17:14 +Tomis: can you even use those swipe gestures in the finder?
17:14  webPragmatist: yes
17:15 +Tomis: oh so you can
17:15 +Tomis: who knew

19:59  mynameisdeleted: final cut can easilly get sluggish
19:59  fujisan: you need a high end Mac with a lot of ram yeah
19:59  mynameisdeleted: 8GB ram + solid state + 2+ghz cpu is the best you can get on macbook
19:59  fujisan: best to get a mac pro
19:59  mynameisdeleted: then I have to do it at home
19:59  fujisan: for video editing thats not really too good
20:00  mynameisdeleted: I gues I can do all my video at home
20:00  mynameisdeleted: and do all else elsewhere on my macbook
20:00  mynameisdeleted: or where I feel like

20:01  fujisan: Avid Media Composer is still more used by pro's that final cut pro

22:16  crilly: erm
22:16  S_SubZero: disk utility can burn iso's sure
22:16  crilly: If it's an ISO then yeah
22:16  macuser: ok
22:16  S_SubZero: Image -> Burn Image, I think
22:16  macuser: but um whenever i do it seems o start taking awhile
22:16  macuser: how long does it take to burn
22:17  crilly: years
22:17  macuser: and when i try to burn it it says "closing session"
22:17  S_SubZero: it depends on the disc, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
22:18  macuser: i have a DVD-R
22:18  macuser: if i forgot to check, "verify burned data" was that the problem
22:19  macuser: is it necessary that this is checked
22:19  macuser: in order for a proper burn
22:20  macuser: Do you have any ideas?
22:21  crilly: macuser: Is the resulting burnt disc not working?
22:22  fujisan: mac-mini: good question
22:22  fujisan: uhm macuser  *

22:40  stephennf: macs rule!
22:40  stephennf: but they got hot so fast :(
22:41  S_SubZero: all macs?  Every single one?
22:42  stephennf: dunno about that. but definitely the newest ones
22:42  stephennf: especially when playing video games
22:42  S_SubZero: pushing the system hard causes it to warm up.  
22:42  S_SubZero: this is a fairly universal thing.  PCs do that too.
22:42  S_SubZero: as do toasters
22:42  stephennf: xD
23:00  Cam: Hi kPa
23:00 * Cam wonders how long it will take kPa to find this window :)
23:00  kPa: Hi cam.
23:00  Cam: Oh darnit. 
23:01  fujisan: =]
23:01  fujisan: hi Cam 
23:01  Cam: Hey fujisan! Good job with the nfts (or whatever) fix!
23:01  fujisan: it wasnt a pretty fix
23:02  fujisan: lol
23:02  fujisan: but at least everything works again
23:02  fujisan: the NTFS drive was corrupt beyond repair 
23:02  fujisan: drive= partition*
23:03  Cam: :O?
23:04  Cam: Did you reformat it?
23:05  fujisan: after i copied the files i wanted yes
23:05  fujisan: but the partition was corrupt
23:05  fujisan: i could have fixed it in windows
23:05  fujisan: but i wanted to clean up anyways
23:06  fujisan: so now the ntfs partition is only 50 GB and i disable the ability to read and write NTFS :)
23:06  fujisan: yeah the problem is the ntfs fileformat i suspect 
23:07  fujisan: os x has no support for it i was using a third party app for it
23:10  stephennf: did u use NFTS-3G?
23:10  fujisan: paragon ntfs
23:11  stephennf: ah
23:11  stephennf: i use ntfs-3g it works great
23:11  fujisan: oh paragon ntfs works great also
23:11  fujisan: only not when the drive gets corrupt
23:11  stephennf: oh :P
23:12  fujisan: the ntfs partition was corrupt
23:12  fujisan: everytime i tried to files from it via the trashcan in os x i got a kernel panic
23:12  fujisan: delete*
23:13  stephennf: :O how'd it get corrupt?
23:13  fujisan: so i went for the simple solution
23:13  fujisan: i boot back and forth between win7 and SL
23:13  fujisan: and use the same external NTFS partition under os x and win7
23:13  fujisan: so i guess maybe they didnt want a love child
23:13  fujisan: i have no clue in other words :)
23:14  stephennf: oh, hmph
23:14  stephennf: that sucks
23:14  stephennf: i do the same thing. hope that doesn't happen to me
23:14  fujisan: hehe
23:14  fujisan: its my own fault i should have let windows repair the partition
23:14  fujisan: but i didnt and then went back into os x and these kernel panics occured
23:15  fujisan: i send the reports to Apple maybe they can do something with it, that'll benefit more users
23:15  fujisan: but the good part is that i have about 800 gb space on my external again :o
23:16  fujisan: i had a lot of junk on that partition
23:16  stephennf: haha
23:16  stephennf: so u have to reinstall windows 7 now?
23:16  fujisan: no ofc. not
23:17  fujisan: the ntfs partition was external
23:17  fujisan: and my win7 is on my internal drive
23:17  stephennf: ohhh okay
23:18  webPragmatist: office 2011 excel for mac is the slowest crappiest thing ever
23:19  stephennf: :/ that's good to know
23:19  fujisan: that's why Apple made bootcamp
23:19  fujisan: gaming and office
23:19  stephennf: iWork > office imo
23:20  fujisan: yeah
23:20  fujisan: but office for windows
23:20  fujisan: has a lot of stuff office for mac doesnt have
23:20  fujisan: such as OneNote
23:21  stephennf: yeah true
23:21  stephennf: if you want to use the less popular ones
23:21  stephennf: than ya gotta bootcamp it up
23:21  fujisan: OneNote is very popular with students actually
23:22  stephennf: oh, what's that one? note-taking?
23:22  fujisan: stephennf:  you can use crossover to install office 2007
23:22  fujisan: yeah it's a really nice app
23:22  stephennf: ok
23:23  fujisan: http://iheartonenote.com/2010/01/04/why-i-love-onenote/
23:23  fujisan: and os x has no such app
23:24  webPragmatist: stephennf: iWork is stupid
23:24  webPragmatist: it's impractical
23:29  Angostura: Why would Office for Mac have OneNote when there isn't a tablet-based Mac?
23:30  fujisan: Onenote can be used without a tablet
23:34  S_SubZero: i did not understand the question at all
23:35  fujisan: and btw there is a tablet based Mac Angostura 
23:36  fujisan: http://www.axiotron.com/index.php?id=modbook
23:36  Angostura: I thought OneNote was used for taking notes with a stylus
23:37  fujisan: :)
23:37  S_SubZero: no
23:37  S_SubZero: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_OneNote
23:48 --- Brisk` is now known as Brisk
23:50  Angostura: Ah there you go, I've only ever come across it in the context of TabletPCs. Live & Learn.
23:50  ErrantEgo: of the mac laptop family, whats the better group?
23:51  ErrantEgo: the MBA or MBP?
23:51  b3ny0-: depends on what you'll use it for
23:51  ErrantEgo: IRC, casual browsing
23:51  ErrantEgo: small game playing
23:51  ErrantEgo: i'm not a big gamer
23:51  b3ny0-: then an air will probably do the job
23:51  ErrantEgo: but i do play a few games
23:52  ErrantEgo: whats the difference btw the 2?
23:52  b3ny0-: I have a MBP for work and a desktop pc for gaming
23:52  fujisan: yeah
23:52  Angostura: The Air is lighter, less powerful
23:52  Angostura: in a nutshell
23:52  fujisan: the Air is great
23:53  b3ny0-: it took 3 generations before the air actually became useful
23:53  b3ny0-: :P
23:53  fujisan: b3ny0-: oh ok
23:53  Angostura: I'm not knocking the Air, BTW
23:53  fujisan: b3ny0-: kazooie my pal :o
23:53  b3ny0-: lets face it, the first one were awful
23:54  b3ny0-: the second wasn't very good, and now its a better (but more expensive) opponent to the netbooks
23:54  Angostura: The first one always reminded me of the 20th Anniversary Mac, for some reason
23:54  Angostura: NIce to look at, less nice to use, costed an arm and a leg
23:54  b3ny0-: heh
23:55  b3ny0-: everyone was like OMG so thin
23:55  ErrantEgo: which one is the better seller
23:55  ErrantEgo: the air or pro
23:55  b3ny0-: but man was it slow too
23:55  fujisan: slow?
23:56  fujisan: how slow was it then?
23:56  b3ny0-: enough to make you feel ripped off
23:56  b3ny0-: luckily I wasn't the one who bought it
23:56  b3ny0-: :)
23:56  fujisan: why doesnt Apple put a modified tiger on the MBA
