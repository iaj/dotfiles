13:57  HackeMate: augi01: no chance to avoid?
13:58  augi01: HackeMate: Eh, depends. For instance, I have my Macbook Pro hooked up to an external display. Even though the lid is closed, the laptop is still on.
13:59  HackeMate: yes, that's exactly my case
13:59  MobGod: morning all
13:59  HackeMate: well, no, I'm using share screen
13:59  HackeMate: if i close the laptop i get kicked out
14:00  augi01: HackeMate: "Share screen"?
14:00  HackeMate: that option to enable the vnc server 
14:00  augi01: Ah.
14:01  augi01: HackeMate: Then I assume you'll get kicked out every time you close the laptop.
14:01  HackeMate: yep
14:08  Blink7: hi all
14:09  Blink7: does anyone have experience with using MAMP with mutliple computers, e.g. two other Windows computers which can access all the virtual domains in MAMP Pro?
14:38  knockout: hi. this is gonna sound really stupid (coming from a developer, no less) but anyone know how can I find the name of the image or it's location on disk of my wallpaper?
14:40  thelostpatrol: sys prefs > desktop & screensaver
14:40  thelostpatrol: under the desktop tab
14:40  thelostpatrol: wallpaper name will show near the top
14:41  thelostpatrol: folder will show in the space on the side
14:42  knockout: hah, that's why i wasn't seeing it... :) apparently the file name is 1280x800 , no extensions
14:43  knockout: thanks
14:55  mamurdian: hey

16:33  duli: I have installed OnMyCommand and executed the ˜first time usres script, but I can't get contextual menus to be shown when right clicking. Any pointers?

17:36  yazdmich: shoot
17:37  yazdmich: both mac repair places other than 2 apple stores in my area cost $450 JUST for the screen for my macbook
17:37  yazdmich: the fairview apple store said $450 for the entire upper half
17:37  yazdmich: not just the led screen
17:38  yazdmich: yet in the US, i could get the upper half replaced for about $120 CANADIAN
17:39  yazdmich: not american funds but canadian funds
17:41  yazdmich: but im not here to complain
17:42  yazdmich: for objective c questions is there another channel?

17:46  crilly: Although we don't mind scripts that announce stuff, don't make it a common occurrence. 
17:47  yazdmich: ok
17:47  yazdmich: its a manually activates script
17:47  yazdmich: activated*
17:47  yazdmich: i use /np
17:50 @ChrisAM: hi

17:52  crilly: Greetings
18:13  Rubarb: Hi, if i have a folder on my system, is it possible to sync it with iDisk? Without actually having it in the iDisk folder?
18:20  crilly: hmmm
18:20  crilly: not sure.
18:39  kateweb: ugg
18:40  kateweb: my phone just made an sd card read only
18:41  yazdmich: shoot
18:42  yazdmich: sure you didn't do it
18:42  yazdmich: ?
18:43 * yazdmich np:  I'm on a Mac ft. Pakwit (Clean) by:  Beau-J & Furia
18:43  kateweb: yeah
18:43  kateweb: aperntly it erased everything on it as well so it could have the whole 16gb card all to itself
18:44  kateweb: hopefully it was nothing inportand
18:44  kateweb: inportant
18:48  yazdmich: wow
18:57  crilly: Does OS X's built in FTP ability only support read-only connectivity? I have read/write to this server, but Finder won't let me upload files.
19:06 --- eagles0513875|2 is now known as eagles0513875
19:07  Saul_Goodman: I have multiple USB audio devices and when they're unplugged and repluged, OS X no longer recognizes them as the default if they were previously set that way, although months ago that used to work properly.  It even breaks my aggregate devices.  They show a greyed out entry for the "old device" and an unchecked entry for the "new device" - it does not realize they are the same.  Any ideas? 
19:11  crilly: Could try the classic repair of permissions using Disk Utility.
19:12  Saul_Goodman: really?
19:12  Saul_Goodman: lol
19:20  shuaib: Hi, I've newly bought mbp (15"), only 3 weeks old. And it has started to annoy me. Around once every two days on average, the destop just stops responding, the application that is active keeps on responding, but I click away anywere else or in any other application window, that stops to respond either, none of the active screen corners respond, and I just get the spinning wheel
19:21  crilly: I'd take it back to the store, or any Apple store, and get it looked at. It's still under warranty.
19:22  shuaib: crilly: I can't predict the behavior correctly
19:22  shuaib: crilly: how am I going to reproduce it for them? :/
19:22  Saul_Goodman: ounds like a failing disk drive
19:22  crilly: You could try re-installing OS X using the provided disks then.
19:22  yazdmich: then let them keep it for 4 days
19:22  Saul_Goodman: they should be able to use their own tools to diagnose it
19:22  yazdmich: tell them to run it 24 hours
19:23  Saul_Goodman: it's your responsibility to tell them what it's doing
19:23  Saul_Goodman: it's their responsibility to diagnose it
19:23  Saul_Goodman: but it sounds like a failing disk drive
19:23  shuaib: So everyone agrees it is some issue in the hardware? :/ Can I do something on my own for diagnositics?
19:23  Saul_Goodman: i'd try restoring from their disks first
19:23  Saul_Goodman: just to make sure
19:23  yazdmich: cant be a disk drive
19:23  Saul_Goodman: of course it can
19:23  yazdmich: the active program works
19:23  Saul_Goodman: if the kernel locks waiting for i/o
19:24  Saul_Goodman: yes because its data is cached in ram
19:24  shuaib: Yea, some of the programs work
19:24  yazdmich: ah
19:24  yazdmich: yeah
19:24  shuaib: but they stop to respond one by one
19:24  Saul_Goodman: yes eventually the kernel tries to swap their paged ram to disk
19:24  yazdmich: any way to check the POST message on a mac?
19:24  Saul_Goodman: and when it cannot it locks
19:24  Saul_Goodman: there is no POST
19:24  Saul_Goodman: mac does not have a proper bios
19:24  yazdmich: oh yeah
19:24  yazdmich: EFI
19:25  Saul_Goodman: post is pretty useless anyways
19:25  Skull0Inc: hey, anyone know how to view memory cache files?
19:25  yazdmich: but my netbooks use EFI and they can display a post message
19:25  Saul_Goodman: "memory cache files"?
19:25  Skull0Inc: cache memory information
19:25  Saul_Goodman: what?
19:25  shuaib: So how's restoring from the OS DVDs going to help?
19:25  Saul_Goodman: simply because
19:26  Saul_Goodman: if it *IS* some weird software bug
19:26  Skull0Inc: i'm looking for stuff that may be stored in cache
19:26  Saul_Goodman: that'll fix it
19:26  Saul_Goodman: what sort of cache
19:26  Saul_Goodman: your browser?
19:26  Skull0Inc: yes
19:26  Skull0Inc: hmm..
19:26  Skull0Inc: well it depends
19:26  shuaib:  Saul_Goodman I see, though I am going to lose updates to my OS that way, right? :/
19:26  Skull0Inc: i've found my browser cache folder..
19:26  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: yes and all your data
19:27  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: i suggest you back it up now anyways because if the drive IS failing you should not trust it
19:27  Skull0Inc: but not the file...is it possible that instead of storing temporary internet files on disk that they are stored in cache memory?
19:27  b3ny0-: vem är de är intresserad av då, nån man känner?
19:27  b3ny0-: nomb kanske
19:27  Saul_Goodman: http://www.beecubu.com/desktop-apps/SafariCacheExplorer/
19:28  Saul_Goodman: there is no such thing as "cache memory"
19:28  Skull0Inc: i'm referring to a post on a mozilla website..
19:28  Skull0Inc: "Such files may only be saved in the memory cache for quick access and not saved on disk. "..
19:28  Saul_Goodman: yes in RAM
19:28  Skull0Inc: exactly
19:28  yazdmich: wth b3ny0-?
19:28  Skull0Inc: hmm
19:28  Saul_Goodman: but it will only stay for a few minutes 
19:28  Skull0Inc: ughh
19:28  Saul_Goodman: mMAX
19:28  Saul_Goodman: if that is the case
19:28  b3ny0-: heh
19:28  b3ny0-: posted wrong?
19:28  b3ny0-: :P
19:28  yazdmich: yes
19:28  Skull0Inc: so not able to access that?
19:28  Saul_Goodman: nope
19:28  shuaib: Are there any logs kept looking at which could be helpful tracing the cause somewhat?
19:28  Saul_Goodman: and it's doubtful you'd ever FIND anythign there
19:29  yazdmich:  Topic is 'Welcome to ##mac! | Channel rules: Play nice, no hackintosh & English only | Register @ http://ircmac.com/ | DIY @ http://iFixIt.com | All channel operators need to take the time to register @ ircmac.com. It's important.'
19:29  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: open terminal.app and run sudo dmesg
19:29  Skull0Inc: hey...so do you know where FF may store temporary .flv videos?
19:29  yazdmich: english only
19:29  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: and then again after it starts "locking up"
19:29  Skull0Inc: i'm trying to avoid having to -re-download a file that may already be on disk..
19:29  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: just leave it all open
19:29  Skull0Inc: avoid
19:30  Saul_Goodman: Skull0Inc: i believe safari's default behavior is to delete any incomplete downloads on quit
19:30  Skull0Inc: no its running now..
19:30  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: it has lots of "dataWriteComplete - writing zero length packet" in dmesg
19:30  yazdmich: ahh
19:30  yazdmich: safari
19:30  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: leave it all open?
19:30  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: yeah
19:30  yazdmich: the best browser
19:30  Skull0Inc: say i have just streamed a video..but don't want to use the ff addon to re-download it if it may already be stored temporarily somewhere on disk.
19:31  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: that's actually your network driver
19:31  Saul_Goodman: Skull0Inc: extremely unlikely
19:31  Skull0Inc: unlikely that its temporarily stored?
19:31  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: or some usb device
19:31  Saul_Goodman: Skull0Inc: that's the point of streaming
19:31  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: that is cause the problem? Or the dmesg logs for? 
19:31  Skull0Inc: so where is the info stored for playback access?
19:31  shuaib: Or both I guess
19:32  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: do you have any USB devices
19:32  Saul_Goodman: Skull0Inc: it's cached in ram for a minute or two
19:32  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: Yea, a USB HD attached, and a usb modem
19:32  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: okay that message refers to the usb hd or modem
19:32 * C\A currently has iTunes stopped.
19:32 * Saul_Goodman currently CARES about C\A's iTunes.
19:32  Skull0Inc: ok, but i still have access to it for hours depending on how long i leave the loaded video window open
19:32  Saul_Goodman: yes
19:33  Saul_Goodman: generally
19:33  Saul_Goodman: it depends on what flash viewer applet they are using and things too
19:33  Skull0Inc: which means its still somewhere..
19:33  Saul_Goodman: why can't you just stream it again or save the file
19:33  shuaib: Btw, during a reinstall of OS, I am not going to lose data on rest of the partitions I've created now, would I?
19:33  Skull0Inc: i know thats the easy answer..
19:34  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: you shouldn't.
19:34  Skull0Inc: but i'd just like to know how these things work also..
19:34  shuaib: The OS install doesn't reset the parition tables, does it?
19:34  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: Ok
19:34  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: i'd also try removing the usb hard disk
19:34  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: and see how stable it is with it removed
19:34  crilly: shuaib: Shouldn't do. It should only format the partition you're installing too. That being said, I would back things up anyway.
19:34  Skull0Inc: wow..someone's multitasking today.. :)
19:34  shuaib: Saul_Goodman: I think I am pretty sure it has been locking up with the HD not attached
19:35  crilly: Skull0Inc: ?
19:35  Skull0Inc: nvmnd..
19:35  shuaib: crilly: I see
19:35  Saul_Goodman: shuaib: cool.  just to be safe and save you some time i'd say just keep terminal.app open and run sudo dmesg once it freezes up (after you've already run it before so it's cached in ram)
