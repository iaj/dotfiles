00:09  Draconicus: Got my hands on an old 2003-series G4 iBook and I'm currently updating it to Tiger since it's all I had laying around, and I just want Java 1.5...               THE GOAL: Run Minecraft without crying.    OBSTACLES: OpenGL 1.1 is apparently really flakey on Tiger, etc.
00:10  jfisk1987: osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to quit'
00:10  jfisk1987: that was it
00:10  Draconicus: Now, google is particularly unhelpful, but I suspect that there may be a couple dirty tricks to force a different variant of OpenGL onto the system, and possibly some other workarounds. Maybe. I dunno. Who's fiddled with puttery old G4s and made them shiny? This is only 800MHz mind you.
00:10  jfisk1987: in case anyone was curious
00:13  zer0rez: what's everyone's obsession w/ minecraft?!
00:16  Angostura: Lores graphics is the new hires graphics
00:16  zer0rez: heh
00:26  LordDragon: zer0rez, agreed. its like 1998 graphics
00:26  LordDragon: ugly as sin
00:26  LordDragon: and boring
00:26  zer0rez: yea
00:27  zer0rez: i haven't played it but i am ok w/ bad graphics if gameplay is good, but gameplay seems like you are combining things constantly
00:27  LordDragon: its like simcity except not even close to as fun
00:28  LordDragon: even simcity 2000 had better graphics
00:44  yazdmich: hey
00:46 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
00:46 +Tomis: the eff.. i just realized my Pictures folder is invisible for some reason
00:46 +Tomis: i can still get to it from the sidebar though
00:46  yazdmich: then do that and change the settings
00:47 +Tomis: i think migration assistant messed some stuff up in the transfer
00:47 +Tomis: yea i need to figure out how to make the folder visible again.. what's the shell command for that..
00:47  jfisk1987: i need some basic terminal help
00:47  jfisk1987: at the botton its stuck on ----INSERT-----
00:47  jfisk1987: and i cant get out...any ideas?
00:48  yazdmich: press insert
00:48  zer0rez: press esc
00:48  jfisk1987: thanks!
00:48  zer0rez: welcome
00:48  zer0rez: vim ftw
00:48  zer0rez: Tomis: um i've never seen migration assistant do that
00:49  yazdmich: yay for mirc
00:49 +Tomis: well i dunno, there was some other weirdness too, like some apps were pointing at the root of the drive, treating it like the home directory
00:50  yazdmich: when i get 1337 C0D3R 5KI115, im so porting mirc to OSX
00:50 +Tomis: lol yazdmich 
00:51  yazdmich: what?
00:51 --- osxdude|iPad_ is now known as osxdude|iPad
00:51  yazdmich: my 13375P34K?
00:52  yazdmich: but really
00:52  yazdmich: when i get 1337 C0D3R 5KI115, im so porting mirc to OSX
00:52  zer0rez: is mirc even open source?
00:52  yazdmich: not sure
00:52  yazdmich: but i will ask them for the source
00:53 +Tomis: why, there's enough ugly IRC clients already
00:53  yazdmich: or i will start a petition
00:53 * zer0rez pats yaz on the head and gives him a biscuit
00:53 +Tomis: and the ones with decent GUI are bloated
00:53  zer0rez: mIRC was rubbish back in the 90s when i stopped using it, i doubt it's gotten better w/ age
00:53 +Tomis: you should forge ahead with a middle-ground app, something lean with a great UI
00:54  yazdmich: i like mirc
00:54 +Tomis: uses 3MB ram! 500kb of disk space! and a modern clean cocoa GUI!
00:54  yazdmich: im using the monochrome state skin
00:55  yazdmich: in fullscreen, it looks like a terminal
00:56  yazdmich: with the whole white-on-black theme
00:56  yazdmich: yeah
00:56  zer0rez: um why not use irssi
00:57  yazdmich: it took my freinds over in #wrongplanet 3 months to get me to try mirc
00:57  yazdmich: im begging you dont try to get me to switch
00:57  yazdmich: again
00:58  zer0rez: haha
00:58  yazdmich: i like mirc now
00:58  yazdmich: i can do basic scripting
00:58  yazdmich: like...
00:59 * yazdmich points yazdmich to under the bridge
00:59  yazdmich: now STAY there!
01:00  yazdmich: i can give you my popups.ini file to prove it
01:00  yazdmich: oh wait
01:00  yazdmich: OSX users
01:00  yazdmich: heh
01:00  yazdmich: if notepad can open ini files, i bet the OSX variant can too
01:01  yazdmich: may i initiate DCC send?
01:04  yazdmich: brb
01:07  jfisk1987: im trying to setup an automator workflow but im getting this error when it hits my shell script which ssh'es in and remotely closes itunes
01:07  jfisk1987: Psyedo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal
01:12  SuperMiguel: when is the new ipad comming out?
01:13  SuperMiguel: any idea?
01:14  jfisk1987: next year?
01:15  jfisk1987: how could i run terminal commands as a shell script?
01:19  jfisk1987: join #ssh
01:23  zer0rez: SuperMiguel: i have the new iPad, it's amazing
01:23  zer0rez: retina display, holographic 3d camera on all sides
01:23  zer0rez: super gps and matching teleporter
01:24  yazdmich: lol
01:24  yazdmich: i want it
01:24  yazdmich: now
01:24  zer0rez: too bad
01:24 +Tomis: you had me up until "i have" zer0rez 
01:24  zer0rez: i got the only one.
01:25 * yazdmich teleports to zer0rez and takes his 2nd gen iPad away
01:25  yazdmich: YAY
01:25  yazdmich: ITS ALL MINE
01:25  yazdmich: ALL MINE I SAY
01:25  yazdmich: ALL MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
01:25  yazdmich: MINE!
01:26  jfisk1987: hmm.. im trying to execute ssh EK219.2168.1.2  osascript -e 'tell application "iTunes" to quit'  in automator
01:26  jfisk1987: but its quitting MY itunes locally :(
01:26  zer0rez: oh sushi is here bbl
01:31  yazdmich: lol
01:31  yazdmich: say spam 10 times
01:31  yazdmich: quickly
01:36  mylisto: hey folks...
01:36  mylisto: Trying to get a friends computer working once again.  I used the rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone to setup a new admin account
01:36  mylisto: it just goes back to the installation thing a ma bob...
01:37  mylisto: How can I create a new admin account?
01:38 +Tomis: what's wrong with the machine first
01:38 +Tomis: and do you have the system DVDs
01:41  mylisto: tomis: I dont' have the dvds
01:41  mylisto: haven't for a long time
01:41 +Tomis: what mac
01:41  mylisto: during the registration process can I just use command+q to bypass the registration?
01:41 --- osxdude|iPad_ is now known as osxdude|iPad
01:42 +Tomis: if it's an intel, then i'd advise either getting Snow Leopard retail, or calling apple and ordered replacement system DVDs
01:42  mylisto: its like 6 or 7 years old
01:42  Angostura: Registration can be cancelled yes
01:42 +Tomis: oh so it's probably PPC then
01:43 +Tomis: what mac is it?
01:43  mylisto: imac?
01:43  mylisto: macbook pro
01:43 +Tomis: it's a laptop?
01:43 +Tomis: it will say the name right under the display
01:44  mylisto: yes its a laptop
01:44  Sh4d03: Hi all, I'm trying to use my 10.6 macbook pro with a USB to Serial adapter to configure a Cisco router. The USB to Serial adapter is showing up in System Info. I've found advice to use Zterm but this only gives me the option for Bluetooth-Modem and Bluetooth-PDA-Sync. Can anyone offer advice on this?
01:44  mylisto: Alls I need to know is this
01:44 +Tomis: well if it's a macbook pro, then it's an intel machine
01:44  mylisto: if I use the command + q during the registration process...will it bypass and let me create a new admin account? while still keeping everything on the computer?
01:45 +Tomis: you can skip registration yes
01:45 +Tomis: or just fill in gibberish
01:45  Angostura: Sh4d03: Who's the adapter by?
01:45 +Tomis: what's the actual problem you're trying to solve though mylisto 
01:45  mylisto: tomis: reseting a password
01:45 +Tomis: you can create a new user account without all this hackery
01:45  mylisto: either way...whats done is done..I already removed the applesetupdone file...
01:46 +Tomis: oh man
01:46  mylisto: problem - no dvds...
01:46 +Tomis: that's easy mylisto 
01:46 +Tomis: get snow leopard retail, $30
01:46 +Tomis: you can upgrade the OS and reset the password as well
01:46  yazdmich: is lion out yet?
01:46 +Tomis: no yazdmich 
01:46  yazdmich: oh
01:46 +Tomis: it's a year away
01:46  Angostura: yazdmich: Next year summerish
01:46  yazdmich: ah
01:47 +Tomis: Mac iOS X 10.7
01:47  mylisto: I know there has to be more ways around this
01:47  yazdmich: i dont actually like the look of lion personally
01:47  yazdmich: but thats me being stiff
01:47  yazdmich: as always
01:47 +Tomis: the fact that they even allow you to reset the password with the system DVDs is a giant security flaw IMO
01:47  Angostura: mylisto: The standard way to reset a password is to use a system disk. That's it
01:48  mylisto: angostura: well I've already started this process.  I know there has to be a way to do this
01:48  Angostura: No - you've started a  process. But you don't know what that process is doing
01:48 +Tomis: how'd you manage to delete the serup file without knowing the password?
01:48  Angostura: If you just wan to create a new admin account you can do that
01:48  yazdmich: hmm
01:49  mylisto: tomis: using unix
01:49 +Tomis: lol
01:49 +Tomis: tha'ts not an answer
01:49  mylisto: angostura: I didn't have the password...
01:49  Angostura: Sh4d03: http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19751/quickterm
01:49  yazdmich: if i powered a bionic arm with an iPod Touch, it would be an arm with an ARM
01:49  yazdmich: lol
01:50  Angostura: No, it would be an arm with an A4
01:50  yazdmich: not the 4th gen
01:50 +Tomis: which is an ARM Angostura 
01:50  yazdmich: 2nd or 3d
01:50 +Tomis: still a bad attempt at humor either way, heh
01:50  Angostura: Tomis: spoilsport
01:50  yazdmich: 3rd
01:50  mylisto: if I am at the apple setup screen and I use command + q will it help me to bypass the registration process?  and at the same time allow me to create a new admin account...and at the same time allowing me to keep everything on the computer?
01:50  Sh4d03: Angostura: it's an HL-2303. Again, it appears in System Info
01:51 +Tomis: try it and find out mylisto 
01:51  Angostura: Try quickterm linked above
01:51 +Tomis: your alternative is to do it correctly, which you're obviously want not to do
01:51 +Tomis: so don't worry if it borks the system up, you don't want to do it correctly anyway
01:52  Sh4d03: Angostura: sorry, got a phone call as soon as I asked. I'll search back and find the link and ask further questions from there. Thankyou
01:52  Angostura: Sh4d03:  No problem http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19751/quickterm
01:53  mylisto: Tomis: why does mac allow people to use the unix backend if its not recommended?
01:54 +Tomis: because you're doing it wrong
01:54  Angostura: The Unix backend has its uses. This is not one of them.
01:55 +Tomis: that's like asking why a car has bolts even if taking them off at random could lead to catastrophy
01:57  sontek: I got arch running on my macbook =)
01:57  sontek: it works petter than I thought it would out of the box
01:58  yazdmich: your macbook?
01:58 +Tomis: eww
01:58  yazdmich: of course it works good
01:58  yazdmich: its from apple
01:59  yazdmich: the only bad product apple recently made wa... actually, nothing apple made recently is bad
02:00  torchie: the worst apple product is
02:00  torchie: the macbook white
02:00  torchie: which is still pretty sweet
02:01  mylisto: yazdmich: haha really?  what about the ipods with serious battery issues?
02:01  mylisto: or my brothers ipod touch that broke after 3 months?
02:01  Sh4d03: Angostura: QuickTerm shows the same two port devices only.
02:01  yazdmich: ok
02:01  yazdmich: those
02:01  yazdmich: the ones that could spontainiusly combust?
02:02  torchie: ipod touch broke after 3 months
02:02  torchie: but man was it an awesome 3 months mirite
02:02  yazdmich: by macbook white, do you mean recent boxy or recent curved?
02:02  Angostura: Sh4d03: Hmm did the device come with OS X drivers at all?
02:03  yazdmich: ?
02:03  Angostura: and you say it shows up in Profiler - is it correctly identified as a serial adaptor?
02:03  Sh4d03: Angostura: No, but I figured given it has registered in System Profiler as "Bus USB -> USB-Serial Controller"
02:04  yazdmich: hello?
02:04  Angostura: Hmmm - OK, I wonder if you need to create a new connection in the Network Pref pane
02:04  yazdmich: torchie?
02:04  torchie: huh what
02:05  Angostura: Sh4d03:  Have a look in Network Preferences see if you can create a new connection tyoe
02:06  Sh4d03: Angostura: Do you mean a new Interface type? I have AirPort, Firewire, DUN, Ethernet, VPN, PPPoE, 4 to 6
02:07  Sh4d03: Angostura: sorry, 6 to 4
02:07  Angostura: Sh4d03: And if you click the plus button ... anything like 'serial interface' show up in the list of possibilities?
02:08  Sh4d03: Angostura: no, only the above interfaces
02:08  Angostura: bum
02:08  Angostura: I've run out of ideas and I'm afraid it os after 1am here
02:09  Sh4d03: Angostura: Ok, thanks for your help. I'll have to see what I can figure out.
02:09  Angostura: Sh4d03: Unless....
02:10  Angostura: Maybe see if this helps: http://sourceforge.net/projects/osx-pl2303/
02:12  Sh4d03: Angostura: oooh, I'll try that :)
02:13  Sh4d03: Angostura: that has reported that a new network interface is available :D
02:14  Sh4d03: and it's called….. USB-Serial Controller :D:D:D
02:14  Angostura: \O/
02:14  Angostura: Good stuff
02:14  Sh4d03: and now QuickTerm has /dev/cu.PL2303….. 
02:14  Sh4d03: Angostura: you're a champ! Thanks mate!
02:14  Sh4d03: Ok, so port settings in QuickTerm configured and I've hit Connect - what's the interrupt necessary on a Mac?
02:15  Angostura: Absolutely no idea. And I have to go to sleep :-)
02:15  Angostura: Good luck
02:15  Sh4d03: Angostura: no probs - thanks again
02:17  nomad411: Hi..  Does anyone know if there's a group for Aperture?  
02:22  Sh4d03: Angostura: hopefully you catch up on this later - but it's Control + b to 'break' 
02:38 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
02:48  jeux: hello
02:49  zer0rez: allo
02:50  jeux: did anyone ever heared about sArchiver?
02:51  jeux: god i love IRC
02:51 * zer0rez blinks
02:52  jeux: zer0her0: :]
02:52  zer0rez: que
02:56  jeux: zer0rez: did you know this sArchiver app?
02:56  zer0rez: no
02:56  jeux: you should check it out, it's kinda cool :]
02:57  jeux: what archiver you are using?
02:57  zer0rez: the built in one
02:57  jeux: what about rar, 7z etc.?
02:58  zer0rez: i don't do warez
02:58  zer0rez: ;)
02:58  jeux: me too
02:58  zer0rez: when do you come across rar, 7z, so on then?
02:59  jeux: a lot win users use them when exchange data
03:00  zer0rez: i very rarely exchange things that are compressed these days
03:00  zer0rez: (outside of the filetype, i.e. video/audio/graphic files which are inherently compressed)
03:00  jeux: i see
03:02  zer0rez: yea
03:06 +Tomis: The Unarchiver is awesome, wish there was an equivolent app for archiving
03:06  jeux: there is
03:06  jeux: sArchiver :)
03:07 +Tomis: based on the name i doubt it, checking it out...
03:07  jeux: it also can create self extracting archives
03:07  jeux: very stant of art utility
03:08 +Tomis: nifty, but not $25 nifty
03:08  zer0rez: ah
03:08  zer0rez: hehe i is jeux spamming his software?
03:08 +Tomis: i wish apple would switch to 7z for their installer packages
03:08 +Tomis: when syste updates are 700MB or whatever
03:09  zer0rez: Tomis: get a real connection ;)
03:09 +Tomis: they could surely shave some MB off by using better compression
03:11  jeux: zer0rez: just sharing, not spamming and im stopping :)
03:11  zer0rez: jeux: i'm playing
03:12  jeux: I won't bother you :)
03:13  jeux: just wanted to hear some opinions, suggestions and criticism
03:14  jeux: criticism mostly 
03:16  zer0rez: hehe
03:16  matthias-: hey
03:17  Yazdmich_iPod: Hey
03:17  matthias-: how do I print all emails from 1 sender
03:17  matthias-: in mail.app?
03:17  Yazdmich_iPod: Not sure
03:18  Yazdmich_iPod: I use the mail client bundled with ms office for mac
03:18 +Tomis: why would you print emails
03:18  matthias-: Tomis: cause i need them 
03:18  matthias-: during meetings
03:19 +Tomis: bring your laptop with you
03:19 +Tomis: stop killing trees
03:19  zer0rez: hear hear
03:19 +Tomis: anyway, just filter the list by sender, select the emails, File>Print
03:20 +Tomis: just tested it, works fine
03:20  matthias-: thx
03:20  jeux: Tomis is green :D
03:20  matthias-: didnt want to work for me for a while
03:20  matthias-: Tomis: cant, need to read them in taxis etc..
03:20  zer0rez: matthias-: tell your boss you need an iPad ;)
03:21 +Tomis: um, get an iPad mate
03:21 +Tomis: yea really
03:21  b3ny0-:  /give ipad
03:21  matthias-: got on

03:21  b3ny0-: I loved it
03:21  matthias-: facepalm o.) http://kimag.es/share/37049699.jpg
03:21 +Tomis: get with the times man
03:21  matthias-: and what boss? 
03:21  zer0rez: and we wonder why over a decade later we're still not in a paperless office
03:21 +Tomis: printing out things to make corrections and notes, uch a waste
03:21  matthias-: my signature reads: Managing Partner
03:22  b3ny0-: thing is I hated it when it was introduced, thought it was utterly unnescessary
03:22  b3ny0-: until I held one
03:22  matthias-: ;-)
03:22  b3ny0-: :P
03:22 +Tomis: because the paperless office is a sham marketing term to sell you more crap zer0rez 
03:22  matthias-: all 14 people in my office have ipads
03:22  matthias-: cause papaer is cool
03:22  zer0rez: Tomis: i've been paperless for over a decade
03:22  matthias-: i like to use my pen
03:22  b3ny0-: I like its versatility 
03:22 +Tomis: stop being an environmental terrorist matthias- 
03:22  matthias-: zer0rez: ofc, a lot of data we've got in electronic format only
03:22  Yazdmich_iPod:  Lol at this http://pics.roomsapp.mobi/kBMjHjlYru
03:23  matthias-: but then again, a lot we have to print out. Like NDAs
03:23  zer0rez: ofc?
03:23 +Tomis: anyway, selecting a bunch of emails and hitting print, works for me
03:23  matthias-: anything that's need to be signed
03:23  matthias-: zer0rez: of course.
03:23  zer0rez: ah ok
03:23  Yazdmich_iPod: She became a fan
03:23  zer0rez: and you carry contracts around constantly?
03:23  zer0rez: are you a lawyer?
03:23  matthias-: Tomis: yeah, dont know why when i hit apple + P it doesnt work, selecting it from file works
03:23  Yazdmich_iPod: Lol
03:23  matthias-: yes i do carry them, no im not a lawyer
03:23  matthias-: i work in finance
03:24  Yazdmich_iPod: I have 669 photos on my iPod
03:24 +Tomis: there's no apple key, tha'ts why, it's command-P
03:24 +Tomis: :-p
03:24  zer0rez: ah finance
03:24  matthias-: Tomis: yeah, that one ;-)
03:24  matthias-: Tomis: I'm in VC and fund management, need contracts on me all the time
03:24 +Tomis: have them sign it digitally!
03:24  matthias-: a lot of banks dont accept it
03:25  zer0rez: that is true
03:25 +Tomis: well take them over
03:25  zer0rez: finance is soooo backwards for how forwards they often are
03:25 +Tomis: you're in VC and fund management, use your powers man!
03:25  matthias-: cant' im too small
03:25  matthias-: ;-)
03:25  matthias-: we could pull maybe 4b on leverage.
03:25  matthias-: need about 70 for a bank ;)
03:25 +Tomis: well you'll never take them over with a defeatist attitude liek that!
03:25  zer0rez: i got out while i could, too much stress
03:25  matthias-: especially those small ones we use. ;-)
03:25  matthias-: zer0rez: what do you mean by that?
03:26  matthias-: the funny thing, is that we're a high-tech company
03:26  Yazdmich_iPod:   http://pics.roomsapp.mobi/J7Se0p7vU7
03:26  matthias-: most of our investments are high tech energy, semicons, .coms

03:26  matthias-: zer0rez: oh yeah
03:26  zer0rez: the stuff they'd have us do, was sooo backwards.
03:27  matthias-: i used to work for UBS and GS
03:27  matthias-: and well, 
03:27  matthias-: i had a few friends in back office in coding, and the apps they were coming out with were SO backwards
03:27  matthias-: heh
03:27  matthias-: there were like 10 different apps doing the same things but coded in different languages
03:28  zer0rez: yea our test servers were in w/ our live servers, something would crash we'd have to get someone to drive out in a company car to reboot the machine
03:28  jeux: lol :)
03:28  zer0rez: couldn't have the test server in the office, even though it was us and a dozen of a testers
03:28  matthias-: and then they got people from oracle to work internally 
03:28  matthias-: zer0rez: heh ;-)
03:28  matthias-: now no one keeps data in US or UK
03:28  matthias-: or any other shitty western country for that matter
03:28  matthias-: its all Israel, Panama, HK
03:29  matthias-: Monaco and .CH few years back
03:29  zer0rez: geez, i was in NYC and the servers were in mid NJ
03:29  zer0rez: i'd hate to see what they have to do to test software now
03:29  Yazdmich_iPod: Heh
03:29  matthias-: they dont
03:29  matthias-: they put it live
03:29  matthias-: :)
03:29  zer0rez: server crash 10am on a monday wouldn't have to worry about being in the office till tuesday
03:29  zer0rez: haha
03:29  matthias-: or those youg fuc**** straight out of uni
03:29  zer0rez: gah!
03:30  matthias-: trying to play with my bloomberg UI
03:30  Yazdmich_iPod: My school streams programs from the board server center
03:30  matthias-: you come back to work, and they've got 'more efficient setup'
03:30  matthias-: and you're like WHERE THE F*** IS THIS GONE
03:30  zer0rez: hahaha
03:30  matthias-: and it's a fact
03:30  zer0rez: i knew enough to fix the bugs or point out UI issues, not actually make major changes ;)
03:30  matthias-: a graduate that plays with UI of ANYTHING is out
03:31  matthias-: dont change position of thigs, people are used to it
03:31  matthias-: and if you change it, they're gonna complain, and if traders complain about a junior coder
03:31  matthias-: he's out
03:31  matthias-: ;)
03:31  matthias-: yh good old days
03:32  zer0rez: yep, best bug i remember finding is one of the pages the save button was actually mapped to reload function
03:32  matthias-: :)
03:32  zer0rez: pointed it out to manager to manager he goes no WONDER i kept losing all my changes this weekend.
03:32  jeux: it was nice to meet you guys, c ya later
03:32  zer0rez: lata jeux
03:32  matthias-: and when it comes to destroynig the forrests, we go through 25 000 pages printed a month
03:33  matthias-: zer0rez: lol
03:33  matthias-: now life is easier
03:33  matthias-: all outsourced
03:33  zer0rez: matthias-: yea i printed all my stuff out and hand commented bugs ;) hence why my comment about understanding as soon as the word "finance" came up
03:33  matthias-: we're small enough not to have massive it infrastructure
03:33  matthias-: heheh
03:33  zer0rez: i think i still have it in a file i haven't touch in a decade in storage.
03:34  matthias-: zer0rez: its just ... nicer
03:34  matthias-: to hold the paper
03:34  matthias-: ;]
03:34  zer0rez: :P
03:34  jfisk1987: hey
03:34  matthias-: and i got an $800 pen! What would i bloody do w/o paper :D
03:34  matthias-: heh
03:34  jfisk1987: im trying to execute 		do script "osascript -e 'tell app "iTunes" to quit'" in currentTab in an applescript
03:34  jfisk1987: but im getting yelled at due to the "" around iTunes
03:35  jfisk1987: is there a way around that?
03:35  matthias-: i'd say there is
03:35  matthias-: like, getting pid of itunes
03:35  jfisk1987: http://pastebin.com/Q9UWgMdt
03:35  matthias-: and quit it?
03:35  jfisk1987: well
03:35  jfisk1987: i wanted to do a safer quit, not really just kill the process
03:35  matthias-: jfisk1987: i don't know, im just guessing ;-)
03:36  matthias-: try tell application "xx"
03:36  matthias-: instead of app
03:36  zer0rez: matthias-: sorry was getting wine
03:36  matthias-: zer0rez: it's ok.
03:36  zer0rez: damn an $800 pen?!?
03:36  jfisk1987: it doesnt like it
03:36  zer0rez: i agree i like good paper and a nice writing implement, but i have come to understand for my field they're dead.
03:37  matthias-: like i spend most of my time on planes or in cars, taxis
03:37  zer0rez: jfisk1987: never grokked applescript
03:37  jfisk1987: metthias do you know how i could do it in terminal?
03:37  jfisk1987: its just 2 lines, ssh EK@192.168.1.101
03:37  matthias-: and its so much more handy to do it on paper.
03:38  jfisk1987: and osascript -e 'tell app "iTunes" to quit'
03:38  jfisk1987: when i add them in terminal just like that one after another it tunnels in ok, but never executes the 2nd command
03:39  jfisk1987: i feel like im missing a tiny word thats causing automator to skip ahead
03:40  jfisk1987: http://i53.tinypic.com/161bbls.png
03:40  jfisk1987: if any of you want the whole automator workflow ill send it. its actually a workflow to sync itunes libraries
03:41  matthias-: hmmm
03:41  matthias-: i think im too drunk
03:41  matthias-: if i make a transfer today
03:41  matthias-: ad it's going to get there in 3 days
03:41  matthias-: will it be there on wed or thu?
03:42  zer0rez: should be wed
03:47  matthias-: lets hope so
04:08  jfisk1987: hey
04:09  jfisk1987: i have a .command script but its only executing the first line
04:09  jfisk1987: http://pastebin.com/6Hicf0q1
04:09  jfisk1987: is there a reason why?

04:26  Kasm279: ffs
04:30 @ChrisAM: jfisk1987 ... why do you need a script? Just pass the itunes quit command as an argument to ssh.

17:15  S_SubZero: gonna say no
17:16  webPragmatist1: worth a try
17:16  LSD`: Now that 10.6.5 is out, it stands a better chance of working than before, but not enough for me to recommend it...
17:16  torchie: :(
17:17  torchie: I saw someone with a pre-unibody macbook pro yesterday and it was like

17:19  torchie: time 2 buy a 15" macbook pro 2007 ho ho ho
17:21  LSD`: dxtr: RAM and HDD are typically non-warranty voiding upgrades. A good rule of thumb is to see whether ort not Apple cover the procedure in your manual
17:22  dxtr: LSD`: I've checked and rechecked. And yes, it covers the procedure :)

17:43  gucko: vxla: oh nice! does it make it more expensive?
17:43  S_SubZero: the video chips are not substantially different.  The 9400M and 320M are similar in function. 
17:43 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 80 seconds
17:43  Tu13es: 2x2gb is cheaper

17:43  Tu13es: oh, ok
17:43  Tu13es: gucko: theoretically 2x2 is faster, but probably marginally

17:44  vxla: yes we know. there's no need to continue using exclamation points. we get it.
17:44  vxla: buy the one you want
17:44  gucko: can you recommend please?

17:45  vxla: yes, go buy a PC
17:45  S_SubZero: 17" MacBook Pro i7 8GB RAM 2 SSD drives
17:45  gucko: O_O!
17:45  S_SubZero: that's my recommendation.
17:45  Tu13es: are they both built-in battery?
17:45  Tu13es: i'd buy the cheaper one, but that's just me
17:46  gucko: ubijtsa: guys are the refurbished ones the same as the new ones?
17:46  Tu13es: refurbs come in a cardboard box, but they include everything a new one does and has the same warranty
17:46  Tu13es: well, i've never bought a refurb mac
17:46  Tu13es: just an ipod
17:46  Tu13es: so maybe the box is the same?
17:46  S_SubZero: my last MBP was a refurb and they have special cardboard refub boxes
17:46  gucko: Tu13es: should I expect scratches?
17:47  Tu13es: no
17:47  gucko: just like a new?!
17:47  S_SubZero: expect gashes across the screen.... ?
17:47  Tu13es: yes

17:47  gucko: wow!
17:47  vxla: Angostura: just dont put them under a black light
17:47  Tu13es: that's what refurbished means..
17:47  Tu13es: they just can't legally sell them as new
17:47  gucko: Tu13es: do you recommend to buy a refurb?
17:48  S_SubZero: "refurb" can be anything from "repaired damaged machine" to "guy returned it because he lost his job a week after he bought it" so who knows
17:48  Tu13es: if a refurb is the specs/price you want, sure
17:48  Tu13es: usually when I buy a mac, they're not available on the refurb store yet, so I buy new
17:50  gucko: Tu13es: one last question please: do you think I should wait for the new ones?
17:51  vxla: gucko: <http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/>
17:51  Tu13es: only you can answer that question
17:51  vxla: for a MBP, best to wait.
18:01  gucko: I still have one problem and I'm really thankful for the help. I have a friend who lives in the US. MBPs are cheaper than in my country. So I'm thinking to buy them online and make the shipping to his address in the US. Is it possible?
18:02  gucko: and how the tax will be calculated?

19:47  S_SubZero: plug it into your computer then start iTunes.
19:48  retrospectacus: I don't have iTunes - I don't have any computers with Windows or Mac on it
19:48  retrospectacus: can't I download it on the phone?
19:49  S_SubZero: Apple doesn't provide that kind of mechanism.
19:51  [Kevin]: yeah, even though pretty much every other smartphone os does
19:51  [Kevin]: there's no way to upgrade your iphone without iTunes
19:52  KaptenRodSkagg: anyone have a good "howto" for changing systemdrive to a new bigger drive?
19:53  KaptenRodSkagg: im using 10,4 on a PPC G4
19:55  retrospectacus: anyone have an opinion, is it worth it for me to chase around trying to get this upgrade? I have a iPhone 3GS with iOS 4.1 already. I would have to borrow someone's Widows PC I suppose
19:55  Tu13es: retrospectacus: to 4.1?
19:55  Tu13es: 4.2*?
19:55  retrospectacus: yeah
19:55  Tu13es: probably not, unless you really want AirPlay
19:56  retrospectacus: what's that?
19:56  Tu13es: it'll let you stream video to an appletv
19:57  retrospectacus: nope - I am definitely NOT a Mac fan as you may have guessed... the only reason I have this phone is my boss gave it to me
19:57  Tu13es: yeah, so don't bother IMO
19:57  retrospectacus: can do! :) thanks, enjoy your overpriced crap

20:37  gucko: BUT
20:37  gucko: I found that I can get a student discount since my friend is a college student
20:37  gucko: so I visited the apple store and selected his college
20:37  crilly: Won't he have to pay taxes for bringing it into the country?
20:37  gucko: but how can apple know that I'm a student or not?
20:38  gucko: crilly: do you mean customs?
20:38  Tu13es: gucko: it asks for verification when you order
20:38  gucko: Tu13es: it didn't ask!
20:38  Tu13es: not to select the store, sure
20:38  Tu13es: did you order it?
20:38  gucko: Tu13es: I reached the payment phase 
20:38  Tu13es: interesting

20:39  gucko: Tu13es: do you mean they gonna ask for it after I pay?!
20:39  Tu13es: yes
20:39  Tu13es: they may
20:39  gucko: shouldn't they do that before I pay? 
20:40  Tu13es: maybe
20:40  Tu13es: it's a lot less work for them to do it after people actually make an order
20:40  Tu13es: vs people just browsing the store
20:40  crilly: Actually, I've always been under the impression you had to order from an IP on the college's campus?
20:41  crilly: Generally the colleges and universities they support are pretty big, well known ones and as such, they have IP classes Apple can check to see if you're on the campus LAN.
20:44  gucko: crilly: what if I want to buy it from my parents' house?!
20:44  Tu13es: it seems it's sort of a random checking thing
20:44  Tu13es: are you ordering in the US store and having it shipped elsewhere?

20:48  gucko: Tu13es: you said they might, and they might not
20:48  gucko: if they do, what could they do?
20:48  Tu13es: shrug, they'll probably ask for your student ID #, or a copy of your student ID, or an email from the university
20:48  Tu13es: deny your order, i guess
20:48  gucko: my friend is actually a college student
20:48  gucko: then my friend can send them his student ID :)

21:12  Tsavo: anyway, lately when I'vee been opening Activity Moniter, the main window hasn't been displaying, and I have to press Command 1 to show it.
21:12  Tsavo: Is there a hidden preference somewhere to make it show up like normal?
21:16  LordDragon: hey aL3x
21:16  aL3x: hey LordDragon
21:16  aL3x: :)
21:17  aL3x: gonna watch this later http://www.amazon.com/Root-All-Evil-Original-Program/dp/B0015GEB4O
21:17  LordDragon: ah cool
21:18  LordDragon: im watching the TWiT podcast
21:18  aL3x: watching? wow, i am really behind in my knowledge of podcasts
21:18  aL3x: thought they were only audio
21:19  LordDragon: nope. its video now too. u can get either version
21:19  aL3x: i have never listened/seen/subscribed ect to any podcast
21:20  aL3x: do you watch Boardwalk Empire? that's prolly my fav show this season
21:20  LordDragon: ah ok. i like watching the tech podcasts
21:20  LordDragon: never heard of it
21:21  aL3x: Boardwalk Empire is awesome; it's about Atlantic City in the 1930's, so its like a mobster show...its on HBO, its really good
21:21  aL3x: it's one of those shows that most people like
21:21  aL3x: well made, goof acting, etc
21:21  aL3x: good*
21:26  LordDragon: ah. alot of guys like that stuff. i dont care for shows about mobsters or the mafia etc
21:26  bob4891: hi, i'm from linux/windows… built a 3rd party lib (libmemcached), trying to locate it, but cannot find a .so
21:27  LordDragon: bob4891, obvious troll is obvious
21:27  aL3x: LordDragon: i am not one who cares for that stuff either, but my bf wanted to see it, and got hooked. it was way better than i expected
21:28  LordDragon: aL3x, do you guys both watch on your laptop?
21:28  aL3x: LordDragon: yeah
21:28  LordDragon: aL3x, where do you put it/watch it?
21:29  aL3x: LordDragon: um, on a table
21:29  aL3x: if in the rv, i put it on the stove...lol
21:29  LordDragon: aL3x, ah ok. it reminds me of how me and my ex used to stay at hotels and watch dvds on my powerbook g4
21:30  Tsavo: stove is a good idea because the heating coils (if they are existant) will keep the laptop cool
21:30  aL3x: LordDragon: we always have it like a foot away from us...so even though i ony have a 13 inch screen, it seems way bigger cause its right in front og us
21:30  aL3x: Tsavo: gas stove
21:30  LordDragon: aL3x, if not in the RV, do you both wear headphones with a splitter?
21:30  Tsavo: oh well it's the thought that counts
21:31  aL3x: LordDragon:  no, i have audio hijack, and i use vlc(which has a way higher preamp) so it gets loud
21:31  aL3x: audio hijack lets you do all sorts of stuff to the sound, i use an effect called double gain
21:31  LordDragon: aL3x, yeah but im assuming when your not in the rv, your out in public right? doesnt the volume disturb ppl?
21:31  Tsavo: the EQ in VLC is much more dynamic than in for example iTunes
21:32  aL3x: the audio/eq is the only reason i use vlc
21:32  Tsavo: Is there an alternative to VLC that uses less CPU?
21:32  aL3x: LordDragon: if we're not wathing in an rv, then its cause i am in a place/apt or whatever...so no, not pubic
21:32  LordDragon: aL3x, ahhh ok
21:32  aL3x: movie/tv time is relax time...i cant re;ax in public
21:35  JoeyJoeJo: I'm trying to boot to an Ubuntu disc on my 1st gen Macbook Pro, but at boot time it only ejects the disc. This happen to anyone else?
21:35  aL3x: JoeyJoeJo: it happened to me when my trackpad has issues (trackpad doubles as force eject)
21:35  aL3x: JoeyJoeJo: but, it could be other reasons...did you try holding down option at boot
21:35  JoeyJoeJo: aL3x: I tried holding down option and C
21:35  aL3x: has=had
21:36  Tsavo: is it a DVD in a non-dvd drive?
21:36  JoeyJoeJo: Tsavo: no
21:36  aL3x: JoeyJoeJo: is it only the ubuntu disk, or all disks?
21:36  JoeyJoeJo: aL3x: I dunno. I haven't tried booting any others yet. Though when I'm booted to OS X it reads the disc just fine
21:37  aL3x: JoeyJoeJo: i would see if it does it to other disks...need to rule out a bad disk
21:38  aL3x: if it's all disks, could be a stuck trackpad, or any other kind of thing; http://refit.sourceforge.net/ i used this when my computer was spitting out all my disks
21:38  LordDragon: JoeyJoeJo, you cant just "install ubuntu" that way. youd need to use the bootcamp assistant
21:39  LordDragon: it will make a safe partition on the mac that can be used for windows or linux
21:39  aL3x: LordDragon: he wasnt trying to install, just boot it
21:39  LordDragon: i thought he was trying to install it
21:39  JoeyJoeJo: aL3x: That was a good call. It booted an old copy of XP I had
21:42  aL3x: :)
21:43  sgn: I've got a nice collection of ripped MP3's that I'd like to transfer to my iPhone. Problem is that itunes refuses to download artwork for albums that are marked as "explicit" in ITMS, anyone been able to work around this?
21:44  aL3x: sgn: ????????? really
21:44  aL3x: i have no explicit music
21:44  claude2: ive never noticed that
21:45  sgn: Well, applies to quite a few albums...
21:45  aL3x: sgn: i would remove "explicit" from them maybe; i dunno, can you upload of=ne of tehse songs, that way i cann see how it acts in itunes?
21:46  aL3x: sgn: you can fix them all at once most likley...but i dunno, without a test song to work with, i dont really know whats up
21:46  sgn: there is no explicit tag in them, they are mp3s...
21:46  LordDragon: sgn, i have a few albums with swearing, but never had a problem with the artwork
21:47  claude2: yeah im not sure if thats why the artwork isnt downloading
21:47  claude2: i have lots of explicit music with album art
21:47  sgn: LordDragon: Started with "Rihanna - Loud" for my part. Same applies to Kanyes and Nicki Minajs new albums
21:47  sgn: aL3x: DCC+
21:47  aL3x: upolad a test song
21:47  sgn: sorry. DCC?
21:47  LordDragon: wow wtf. netflix just went up 5 dollars
21:47  aL3x: sgn: dcc? is that the file sendy thing...yeah go ahead
21:48  aL3x: i dunno if it works on limechat though...
21:48  sgn: seems not.
21:49  aL3x: it popped up, but blah blah conneciton, one sec
21:49  sgn: has anyone bought rihanna-loud on itunes? Could they check their tags for me?
21:49  aL3x: sgn: tryone more time, i changed my dcc settings
21:50  aL3x: or http://www.2shared.com/
21:51  sgn: hmm
21:52  aL3x: just use that upload site i guess http://www.2shared.com/
21:52  JoeyJoeJo: aL3x: Do you know if it's possible to boot to a usb stick? I know I can make a bootable one with ubuntu on it. 
21:53  aL3x: JoeyJoeJo: it's possible, but i have NEVER been able to get it to work...alot of variables involved...ie. sometimes the firmware of hte stick itself makes a difference. i am pretty sure all working methods require rEFIt tho
21:53  sgn: might not be the reason why itunes refuses to get the coverart anyway. still applies to three new albums without complicated names..
21:53  sgn: can it be manually added as if it was downloaded?
21:53  JoeyJoeJo: aL3x: thanks, I'm gonna download rEFIt
21:53  aL3x: sgn: if your album names dont match EXACTLY, you cant get art
21:53  sgn: aL3x: "Rihanna - Loud". Can't be :)
21:56  aL3x: maybe there is a space before the L....lol...i have seriously ahd thathappen
21:56  aL3x: itunes is too picky
21:57  bob4891: anyone know how to tell if a library is 32 or 64 bit? ldd doesn't seem to be on this machine
21:57  Tsavo: I went through my entire itunes library one day adding album art. ever since then i make sure to add the album art when i add the music
21:57  aL3x: me too
21:57  aL3x: all my music is in order
21:57  Tsavo: i basically did that when the iPod touch came out and i was keen on using coverflow
21:58  Tsavo: I think i spent more time adding the album art than actually using coverflow though
21:58  aL3x: lol
21:58  aL3x: i use coverflow on my mac, thats my default view
21:58  Tsavo: is it useful? i can't use it as i'm on tiger and even if i had Leopard my compy couldn't handle it
21:59  aL3x: it's useful for me...cause i rarely know what i wanna hear, and i just flip through it until someonthing jumps out at me
21:59  Tsavo: Oh i thought you meant in Finder
21:59  LordDragon: i have itunes setup to show the album artwork on the bottom left hand corner while playing music :)
21:59  aL3x: coverflow in itunes
21:59  aL3x: in finder, no, coverflow is not useful, not for me anyway
22:00  aL3x: LordDragon: if you double click that it launches a mini player
22:00  LordDragon: aL3x, yep i know :)
22:00  Tsavo: that's evidently a post itunes 8 feature
22:00  aL3x: many people did not know before...i made a video to show people, like awhile ago...cause i stumbled on it by accidnet
22:01  aL3x: Tsavo: i never noticed it til itunes 10
22:01  Tsavo: itunes 8 jsut opens a magnified view of the album art
22:01  aL3x: and since NO ONE else knew about it either, i think it was new
22:01  aL3x: Tsavo: what kind of mac do you have
22:01  Tsavo: late '06 macbook
22:02  aL3x: sgn: i dunno your itunes deal, but there is a 3rd party app called coverscout...it has a free trial
22:02  aL3x: Tsavo: um, thats what i have and it handles snow leopard just fine
22:02  Tsavo: http://gyazo.com/4424205d5e30118ae5db53e3e80b33b4.png
22:02  Tsavo: maybe i should upgrade one of these days
22:02  aL3x: Tsavo: i have 2 gigs ram, and a core 2 duo 2.0 gh
22:03  Tsavo: 1.8 so i'm not that far off
22:03  sgn: windows rig here, sorry :)
22:03  LordDragon: wow that is a highly customized osx install
22:04  aL3x: Tsavo: the 950 gma is the only weakness....photo editing is getting more and more difficult with newer software
22:04  Tsavo: yah it's terrible. i can watch the checkerboard deal in photoshop or aperture as the photo renders
22:04  Tsavo: one square at a time
22:04  Tsavo: I'm actually surprised it canhandle this monitor
22:04  LordDragon: what is gyazo?
22:04  aL3x: Tsavo: you using shapesifter?
22:04  Tsavo: it's just a image capture program that automatically uploads to gyazo
22:05  aL3x: shapeshifter*
22:05  Tsavo: yep aL3x 
22:05  aL3x: Tsavo: that's one hting that sux about upgrading...no options really...i have green buttons, instead of graphite, or red, yellow, green
22:05  aL3x: other than that my gui is stock
22:05  Tsavo: ahh yah I'm hesitant to upgrade to leopard because it's too purple. i'm not a fan of how finder looks
22:06  aL3x: Tsavo: you dont want leopard
22:06  aL3x: Tsavo: if anything, you wnat snow leopard
22:06  Tsavo: (Snow) Leopard
22:06  aL3x: ok
22:06  Tsavo: when i say leopard I mean anything above tiger
22:06  aL3x: Tsavo: purple?
22:06  aL3x: there is not purple
22:06  LordDragon: i like most of the stock settings on osx
22:06  Tsavo: yah i cant explain
22:06  aL3x: no*
22:06  Tsavo: not the color purple. just a feeling i get
22:07  aL3x: i get that
22:07  Tsavo: I put the dock on the right side of my screen because when both of my moniters are together it's in the middle
22:07  Tsavo: or in the middler
22:07  aL3x: http://cl.ly/0c3F0b3j2m1z2v172x19
22:07  aL3x: my current desktop
22:07  aL3x: like 2 min ago
22:08  Tsavo: haha the interfacelift fish
22:08  aL3x: yep
22:08  aL3x: i get all my wallpapers from there (or i take my own pics)
22:08  Tsavo: same same
22:08  LordDragon: whats that thing on the bottom right aL3x ?
22:08  aL3x: LordDragon: a new dl manager i am trying
22:09  LordDragon: ah ok
22:09  aL3x: called folx
22:09  Tsavo: http://gyazo.com/98b234a06b77df1091c0b8ced002a5ef.png
22:09  aL3x: i ried dl-ing hte 10.6.5 combo update for a week...and since i travel had to start over everytime...so got t that
22:09  Tsavo: it it just for download? or can it moniter upload? or is it just for "downloading stuff right now"
22:10  aL3x: taget: i dunno what all it does, but it doubles as a bittorent client, i know that
22:10  Tsavo: gotcha
22:10  aL3x: i use it to be able to resume downloads
22:11  aL3x: also, it does that whol splitting them into threads, but the free version only does like 2, so not much of a peed increase, if any
22:11  aL3x: speed*
22:14  Tsavo: It'd be nice to have a way to cap overall upload rate 
22:14  Tsavo: across all applications
22:15  aL3x: there is probably some network admin tool that does that
22:15  Tsavo: probably in OS X server
22:16  Tsavo: because that'd be useful on a server, and it'd be useful to control Apache
22:18  Tsavo: ¡chao pescao!
22:19  aL3x: ?
22:19  Tsavo: it's the spanish equivelant to "see ya later alligator" or "in a while crocidile"
22:20  Tsavo: 'bye fish'
22:34  Shadow__X: hey guys i was wondering if someone could help me with a really simple cocoa app
22:34  Psy: wrong channel
22:35  MultiFinder: Shadow__X: #macdev would probably be able to help you out more than we could.
22:35  Shadow__X: oh ok great thanks
22:35  MultiFinder: Cheers :)

23:26  swombat: slightly off-topic... I'm UK-based and trying to upgrade my iPad to 4.2.1, but iTunes is showing only 3.2.2 as the latest version, even though checking photobs.apple.com/version sends me to appleldnld.apple.com which has iPad iOS 4.2.1... any ideas?
23:29  swombat: nvm, got it
23:29  swombat: just click "update" and it checks again
