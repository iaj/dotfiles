08:32  eagles0513875: hey guys any logic studio users or anyone know where the logic studio library of loops can be found
09:14 +Tomis: eagles0513875: /library/audio/loops/
09:14 +Tomis: something along those lines
09:14  eagles0513875: got it in the end 
09:14  eagles0513875: was looking int he system libraries
09:14  eagles0513875: not my own home libraries

09:54  Suit_Of_Sables: does anyone know what kind of cable I could use to connect a macbook pro to an HDTV? DVI to HDMI?
10:02 +Branes: Depends on the MBP, Sable.
10:08  Suit_Of_Sables: MBP 5,3
10:16 +Branes: I think Belkin make a suitable MiniDisplayPort to HDMI cable, but you will still need a separate cable for audio. The MBP5,3 does not output audio on its MiniDisplayPort connector.
10:26  Suit_Of_Sables: wah! and no way to have, say, a cable that is mini display and 16th inch jack on one end and both go to hdmi eh? :)
10:27  Suit_Of_Sables: i do have a 16th inch jack to 2 rca plugs though. which could work
10:31 +Branes: No-one makes such a cable to my knowledge, Sables.
10:32  Suit_Of_Sables: worth a shot :p yeah I could always do mini display to hdmi for video and 3.5mm jack to 2 RCAs for audio
10:32 +Branes: There's one company (can't recall the name right now) that makes an integrated interface solution, a small box that connects to the USB port (for audio) and the DVI/MDP connector, and has a normal HDMI connector on the other side.
10:34 +Branes: The interface merges the two so that the one cable carries full audio+video HDMI
10:34 +Branes: It isn't cheap, though
10:35 +Branes: T'would be cheaper to get a quality MDP-to-HDMI cable, a min-stereo-phone to twin-RCA-male cable of the same length, and cable-tie them together :)

10:49  richardcavell: Where can I identify when my computer is paging to or from Virtual Memory?  I used to remember that Activity Monitor had 'page ins' and 'page outs' but on my system it now gives a memory size instead of a number
10:49  richardcavell: Branes: Do you know?
10:49  richardcavell: I'm trying to record TV on my eyeTV dongle and when VM is active the TV skips
10:49  richardcavell: I want to turn off VM
10:50 +Branes: You can't turn off OSX's virtual memory system. Or control it in any way.
10:50  richardcavell: see that's annoying
10:50  richardcavell: When I'm recording a TV show every time it pages in or out it skips
10:51  richardcavell: I once saw it documented that you can actually turn off OS X's virtual memory, but when you use up all available memory it brings down the whole computer instead of giving you a nice error message, and Apple stated no intention to 'fix' it
10:51 +Branes: Yup. Soon as it runs out of memory, kernel panic.
10:52  richardcavell: Is there a way to at least see when it pages so that I can monitor it and maybe close down some threads?
10:52 +Branes: And the hack to do so requires byte-level modification of the kernel executable.
10:52 +Branes: Not that I'm aware of.
10:53 +Branes: Someone may've discovered it, search www.macosxhints.com
10:54  richardcavell: There's something you can change in a configuration file
10:54  richardcavell: Where it gives the location of the pagefile, you leave it blank or something like that
10:54 +Branes: All that does is make it use root, instead of the usual subdirectory
10:55  richardcavell: See Linux will work without a pagefile
10:55  richardcavell: I'd like to be able to turn it off for Windows games too
10:56 +Branes: it'd be easier to build a cheap PVR-box out of generic components. And more sense to build a wintendo for gaming.
10:58  richardcavell: I have a Windows PC that is primarily for games
10:58  richardcavell: On the Amiga we never had VM
10:58  richardcavell: And it never dropped a single frame
10:59  richardcavell: Ever
11:00  S_SubZero: what's the Amiga have to do with anything
11:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v KB1JWQ]
11:01  richardcavell: I'm just saying
11:01  richardcavell: When I play games, the frame rate jitters about
11:01  richardcavell: On the Amiga it was exactly 50 Hertz
11:01  richardcavell: Exactly
11:02  S_SubZero: I didn't see games mentioned, or "jitter" until now. You didn't say any of that before.
11:02  S_SubZero: you were talking about pagefiles
11:02  richardcavell: When there's a smooth pan happening, it stutters every now and then, presumably while some thread does some business - the virus checker scans a file, the operating system does something
11:02  richardcavell: Or VM pages in and out
11:02  S_SubZero: and this is standard definition TV?
11:03  richardcavell: See on the Amiga you always knew exactly how much RAM you had, and had complete control over it
11:03  richardcavell: Yes Standard def
11:03  richardcavell: My MacBook has 4 Gigs of RAM (3.2 addressable)
11:04 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
11:05  S_SubZero: I dont know the memory overhead for recording TV shows.  I can't see how 4GB wouldn't be enough, as many people build HTPCs with far less RAM
11:07  richardcavell: Well it still pages in and out of VM
11:07  richardcavell: I used to have 1 Gig and that was dreadful- paging all the time
11:07  richardcavell: I upgraded it and it's much better
11:07  richardcavell: But still pages to and from VM, in spite of the fact that I'm not using all of the 3.2 Gigs
11:09  S_SubZero: it's not a new concept.  Windows does that too.  It seems certain processes are bound for pagefile regardless of RAM.  
11:13  richardcavell: well it interferes with games
11:13  richardcavell: See, I wish that there were some API by which the game could say "We're playing a game now so turn all non-essential daemons off"
11:14  richardcavell: On the Amiga what you did was override the OS's vector file and thereby prevent it from taking control of your CPU, full stop.
11:14  S_SubZero: well, it shouldn't really interfere.  It sounds like there's some IO contention at the hard drive.  
11:15  S_SubZero: you really seem like you should just find an Amiga.
11:15  richardcavell: That would be a good idea
11:16  richardcavell: Seriously they did not miss a single frame
11:18  Velociraptors: they had some awesome hardware for the time - which models did you use?
11:20  richardcavell: A500
11:20  richardcavell: Bought an A1200 in 2004
11:22  Velociraptors: :). I used an A1200 from around 1992 or 1993 to 2000. Neat machine in a lot of ways. 
11:22  richardcavell: Yeah
11:22  richardcavell: The operating system in its basic form uses 70 kilobytes of RAM
11:23  richardcavell: And people used to complain about that
11:23  richardcavell: No VM
11:23  richardcavell: at all
11:23  richardcavell: 68000 chip can't do VM
11:42  BobbyJr: Loved  the Amiga myself, still one of the greatest personal computers ever designed IMHO.
11:48  richardcavell: yep
11:48  richardcavell: Amiga was awesome
11:48  richardcavell: One of the things I liked was that programming in assembly was almost as easy as programming in a high level language
11:48  richardcavell: Because the 68k instruction set was so orthogonal
11:49  richardcavell: Try doing that in EM64T
11:51  BobbyJr: I never done any development on an Amiga, at the time I was doing some work with Acorn and RISC-OS machines and then moved onto DOS and PC's - bit of a step back really lol.
11:52  richardcavell: yeah
11:52  richardcavell: I used to write demos for the Amiga
11:52  richardcavell: The copper ruled
11:52  richardcavell: The blitter ruled
11:52  richardcavell: But you know the one thing that the PC guys were really jealous of was sound
11:53  BobbyJr: yeah Amiga was decades ahead with its sound hardware
11:53  richardcavell: I had some PC friends
11:53  richardcavell: And they said that there was no visual demo that the Amiga could produce that couldn't be emulated on PC
11:53  richardcavell: All the copper tricks etc could be reproduced

16:07  Angostura: I don't understand yours
16:07  drdo: What is it about my question that you don't understand?
16:09  Angostura: What aspect of the swap behaviour do you want to change? 
16:09  torchie: he wants to DESTROY THE SWAP PARTITION
16:09  drdo: the swappiness
16:09  zer0her0_: I said do you speaka my language
16:09  torchie: MAN THIS SHIPS
16:09  torchie: SHOOT THE CORE
16:09  zer0her0_: he just smiled and gave mea  vegemite sandwich
16:10  Angostura: There's no swappiness equivalent on Mac. Are you finding it is swapping out to disk too early?
16:11  drdo: Yes
16:12 +Branes: drdo: It is not possible to control or configure OSX's virtual memory swap system.
16:12  drdo: I was running a memory heavy program and it was swapping a lot with 1GB+ free ram

16:21  zer0her0: it all makes sense

16:45  webPragmatist: and just stop worrying about the filenames all together
16:46 +LaraX: webPragmatist: because I had it upload it automatically to Picasa Web Albums from the phone, and that's the default file name it gives, and once it's there it doesn't let you rename it. so I want to change the default
16:46 +LaraX: if possible
16:47  zer0her0: 24 hour is so much better

17:08  zer0her0: Tu13es: haha
17:08 +LaraX: it's like IRC right?
17:08  zer0her0: topriddy: hell yea
17:08  zer0her0: twitter is more asynchronous
17:09 +LaraX: like a forum?
17:09 +LaraX: I'm trying to think of what I'd actually use it for. I couldn't care less about following celebrities
17:09  Tu13es: i think the "microblag" concept is possibly the easiest to describe it as
17:09  Tu13es: i found it really interesting last night when comcast's DNS was down
17:10 +LaraX: and I don't care about what random things everyone is doing all day
17:10  Tu13es: a friend txted me his comcast wasn't working, i checked out @comcastcares and verified it was a big outage
17:10  zer0her0: LaraX: i don't follow celebrities either
17:10  zer0her0: yea i use it to follow service outages, tech news, and friends that have move abroad
17:10  iaj: got a question I got, 198: /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/syntax/tex.vim  in my scriptnames.. however the .tex file ain't getting syntax highlighted correctly :\
17:10 +LaraX: zer0her0: maybe it can be like an RSS feed, instead of reading a blog?
17:10  zer0her0: i keep up w/ my friend that live in UK, France, Turkey, & Hong Kong easier through twitter
17:11  zer0her0: LaraX: often yes
17:11 +LaraX: service outages is a good idea
17:11  Tu13es: I scored a $10 2.5" 250gb drive the other day thanks to twitter :)
17:11 +LaraX: like a blackout?
17:11  topriddy: LaraX: follow developer savvy lionks, friends, cnn news, etc
17:11  Tu13es: i don't follow news feeds, that's what RSS is for
17:11  topriddy: Tu13es: well your right...
17:11  Tu13es: sure, it's not as "breaking", but @cnnbrk sucks
17:12 +LaraX: it might be to interesting to follow google on there
17:12  topriddy: Tu13es: me i follow my real life friends, and they follow me back, we keep a tab on each other that way
17:12  Tu13es: yeah
17:12  Tu13es: ditto
17:12  Tu13es: plus some others
17:12  zer0her0: topriddy: yea exactly
17:13  topriddy: then its actually funny, teasing and very random too...
17:14  topriddy: twitter is what you define it to be, i am too lazy X_X to configure rss feeds, so i even follow things like DZONE, cnnbreak and some software developers am interested in their tweets...
17:14  topriddy: between, i noticed when i place a weighty object on my macbookpro my system(the left space before the trackpad) it  gets fooled and initiates a sleep
17:15 +LaraX: zer0her0: service outages as in electricity right? there's nothing for mine: http://twitter.com/conedison ...
17:16  topriddy: for software developers, twitter APIs provides us another way of reaching and providing customer support and info to customers/clients
17:19  vxla: zer0her0: excellent; were they just doing flyovers with you videoing?
17:20  zer0her0: LaraX: no, i mean for outages for hosting services i use
17:20  vxla: Tu13es: Target (chain store in the states) had WD 2TB drives (external power required0 for $69/USD
17:20  Tu13es: vxla: yeah, I grabbed one of the 1TB 2.5" drives 
17:20  vxla: I got one to use for time machine just to have a spare around. Unfortunately there's no drive encryption.
17:20 +LaraX: I'm looking for apple on twitter... it's not apple or appleinc but sites are saying they have a verified twitter account
17:20  zer0her0: vxla: it was a set of training excercises they wanted me to video tape
17:20  vxla: Tu13es: I was gonna do one of those, but don't have one big honkin' drive for time machine
17:20  vxla: zer0her0: excellent.
17:20  Tu13es: yeah
17:21  Tu13es: i really didn't want to have to lug another PSU around
17:21  Tu13es: or wall wart
17:21  vxla: i wish time machine offered drive encryption (at least in software)
17:22  Tu13es: i wish time machine offered <list of stuff>
17:22  Tu13es: heh
17:22  vxla: heh
17:22  Tu13es: I use Backblaze for most of my crucial backups
17:22  Tu13es: i back up my aperture vault remotely as well
17:22  Tu13es: that's about it
17:22 +LaraX: I think this is the closest you'll get: http://twitter.com/pschiller
17:23  Tu13es: yeah
17:24  vxla: Tu13es: backblaze, that's the $5/month one. thanks (some folks at work were discussing it months ago but I couldn't remember)
17:24  Tu13es: yep
17:24  Tu13es: it'll do external drives, too
17:24  Tu13es: but otherwise $5/computer
17:24  Tu13es: not a big deal for me
17:51  ChrisAM: hi
17:55  claude2: does anyone know if any of the ios ssh clients are capable of not dropping ssh sessions if you switch to something else and come back in ios4?
17:55  claude2: im guessing its not possible
17:56  Tu13es: claude2: iSSH will keep them open up to 10 mins
17:57  Tu13es: it will remind you after 9 mins to switch back to keep them alive
17:58 * claude2 faints
17:58  claude2: that is amazing - thanks!
17:58  alexbobP: when I run an ssh client on android, I can run my browser for hours and not have a problem...
17:59  Tu13es: yeah, claude2, you should just cancel your contract and buy an android phone, obviously
17:59 * Tu13es sighs
18:00  b3ny0-: iSSH kept crashing for me last time I used it
18:01  claude2: haha yeah thats a perfect solution
18:01  claude2: though I do enjoy not having to kill processes and turn of radios to get >2 hours of battery life
18:06  ImQ009: hello there
18:07  ImQ009: is accessing Single-User mode hackint0sh?
18:08  ChrisAM: ImQ009 ... On Apple hardware?
18:08  vxla: ImQ009: no
18:08  ImQ009: ok
18:08  ImQ009: When i try to access Single-User mode i get "Error loading operating system"... could someone help please?
18:09  Tu13es: ImQ009: are you using apple hardware?
18:09  ImQ009: yes
18:09  ImQ009: IMac from early 2006
18:09  ChrisAM: What did you break that requires single user mode to fix?
18:09  ImQ009: i lost admin password
18:09  vxla: can you `sudo passwd root` as your user?
18:10  ChrisAM: boot to your OS X DVD and you can reset the password from there.
18:10  ImQ009: i dont have the dvd :/
18:10  ImQ009: thats the main problem
18:10  ImQ009: ill try sudo passwd root sec
18:11  ImQ009: requires password :/
18:11  vxla: yes, your own password
18:12  vxla: if you are in the administrators group
18:12  zer0her0: vxla: did you not read the he forgot his password statement?
18:12  vxla: ahh, sorry. I thought he meant the root password for his machine (but still was able to login with his own username)
18:13  ImQ009: yes
18:13  ImQ009: im using mac os 10.4
18:14  zer0her0: vxla: os x hasn't come w/ root enable for quite sometime
18:14  vxla: i enable it immediately.
18:14  vxla: figured everyone did
18:14  ChrisAM: what for?
18:14  zer0her0: you're brilliant.
18:15  vxla: I'd prefer security when dropping into single user mode
18:15  zer0her0: ?!
18:17 +Branes: no-one in their right mind enables root and leaves it that way
18:18  vxla: Branes: why wouldn't you?
18:18 +Branes: No point.
18:18  Macstheyjustsuck: -.-
18:18  vxla: I beg to differ, but we'll just disagree on this point.
18:19 +Branes: It's about as useful as wheels on a fish, or a command-line
18:19  vxla: Not really, it has it's uses
18:21  webPragmatist: o hai
18:21  zer0her0: vxla: such as?
18:21  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: Did you just imply that command lines are useless?
18:21  vxla: zer0her0: disallowing direct administrative access to the machine when dropping into single user mode.
18:22 +Branes: Imply? No; stated.
18:22  Macstheyjustsuck: Could you explain that?
18:22  claude2: some people just prefer root over sudo
18:22  claude2: its a personal preference
18:22  vxla: zer0her0: a check-box for most company security policies, yes. but still provides one more small security mechanism
18:22 +Branes: What's to explain? It's a neolithic, non-intuitive method of technology interaction that should've died in 1979.
18:23  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: don't bother, he's trolling mostly, but does have somewhat of a point.
18:23  Macstheyjustsuck: No, he doesn't have a point. 
18:23 +Branes: It violates Kay's First and Third Laws.
18:23  vxla: in the whole grand scheme of things, yes...we should be far beyond command lines by now
18:23  Macstheyjustsuck: Command lines give more control over your OS, it's faster in a lot of situations, if you're learning a language (this is an opinion, I s'pose), but it helps you learn the language better without an IDE
18:24  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: the point is that computer systems are deficient because they only give you control via a command line.
18:24  vxla: or, 
18:24  vxla: *that much* control, I should say
18:25  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: That's why I like OSes like Ubuntu :] Can use a command line all you want but there's a GUI if you don't want to :D
18:25 +Branes: Kay's First Law: Teach computers how humans work. Never teach humans how computers work, for as soon as you do, they lose their humanity.
18:25 +Branes: Kay's Third Law: Technology must strive, always, to become invisible in the environment.
18:25  vxla: Branes: see, I can agree with that statement (first law)
18:26  Macstheyjustsuck: Maybe if people didn't follow those laws they wouldn't be so retarded. They should strive to learn about what runs the world.
18:26  vxla: what runs the world are humans creating errors in the machine because they don't understand what they've built. take for instance: SCADA systems
18:26  claude2: Claude's first law: almost everything is faster and easier in the command line
18:27  Macstheyjustsuck: ^
18:27  Macstheyjustsuck: claude2: After a bit of learning, of course.
18:27 +Branes: Anyone who truly believes *that* has an acute case of fith.
18:27  claude2: haha right
18:27  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: Command lines are much faster in most situations
18:27  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: when compared to broken user interfaces, yes
18:27  claude2: well i'm a linux sysadmin, so I get paid to use the command line
18:28  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: No, when compared to any GUI
18:28  claude2: i could get 100% of my work done with a command line only
18:28  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: see, yo'ure still thinking like it's 1998 and mostly everything sucks.
18:28  Macstheyjustsuck: You can't do everything with a GUI most of the time as well
18:28  vxla: personally I can't stand GUI's, but I do understand the points Branes is making.
18:28 +Branes: If you're preapred to lose your humanity and bother to learn the non-consistent, non-intuitive methods involved in using a syntactically poor and an overly-structured language to interact with something, go for it.
18:28  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: No, I'm not saying everything sucks, I'm saying GUIs own, but command lines own harder if you know them well (which I don't)
18:28  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: if you can't do everything with a GUI, then the GUI has been broken purposefully.
18:29 +Branes: Personally, I think you've something wrong in the head if you do.
18:29  claude2: thats true
18:29  Macstheyjustsuck: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000619.htm
18:29  Macstheyjustsuck: winzorz
18:29  vxla: take this for instance: imagine being able to use an electric pen on a screen to draw circles around entire clusters of servers that need to be upgraded. check a box, and everything is upgraded. done.
18:30  vxla: no bullshit of having to login to 200-300 machines and upgrade everything individually.
18:30  ChrisAM: yeah... write a shell script to do that. :P
18:30  Macstheyjustsuck: ^
18:30  vxla: of course
18:31 +Branes: vxla's example is an excellent one, and suits the paradigm I am trying to impart perfectly.
18:31  Macstheyjustsuck: Also, have you tried installing things through the command line? It's so much faster it should be a no-brainer what one chooses
18:31 +Branes: It also fits Kay's First.
18:31  vxla: but taking that collective effort of every admin having to write their own shell scripts out of egotism and putting it towards building something that just "works"
18:31  Macstheyjustsuck: sudo apt-get install programname wutwut
18:31  claude2: we already have software that purports to do that. Cisco MARS. its a complete disaster
18:32 +Branes: Macs do it better. Drag what you want, where you want, run.
18:32  vxla: Cisco MARS? that's 5-7 years ago.
18:32  vxla: welcome to 2010
18:32  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: You still need both folders up
18:32  claude2: ive never paid much attention to it, cause i don't need a gui :-)
18:32  vxla: like this, this has to be one of the most awful fucking things I've seen in my career
18:32 +Branes: So? 
18:32  vxla: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh/
18:32  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: Too much effort
18:33  vxla: someone wrote a UI to copy terminal input to other terminals. why didn't they just fix the real problem?
18:33  Necrosand: So are you a really bad troll or just completely uninformed, Macstheyjustsuck?
18:33 +Branes: Against the 3-5 years of effort needed to learn the intricacies of the commandline? I think not.
18:33  vxla: claude2: Cisco MARS is not a gui. maybe you don't understand what it is. it's a flow aggregator which includes a GUI
18:33  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: cp fir*tab* Ctabkdjftodirectory
18:33  ChrisAM: DropZone does installs nicely: "Drag a DMG onto the Install Application destination, and Dropzone mounts the disk image, finds the application inside, copies it to your applications folder, launches it, ejects the disk image and moves it to the trash for you. "
18:33 +Branes: That makes absolutely no sense.
18:33  Macstheyjustsuck: Necrosand: I forgot about the Macs having that thing where you open .dmg and drop it onto the icon
18:33  Macstheyjustsuck: :[
18:34 +Branes: It doesn't make any *human* sense. THere is no viable paradigm in which that meaningless string of characters can fit.
18:34  Macstheyjustsuck: on windows it's copy :]
18:34  Macstheyjustsuck: I'm not sure what it is on a Mac, probably cp, but still, that's faster
18:34  Macstheyjustsuck: cp = faster than copy :]
18:35  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: you use linux but don't know how to copy files on other unices?
18:35  Macstheyjustsuck: Ot
18:35  Macstheyjustsuck: it'd probably be copy
18:35  Macstheyjustsuck: But I've never used the command line on a mac
18:35  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: why not? you're implying they're greater than a GUI
18:35  vxla: correct?
18:35  Macstheyjustsuck: Macs are made to look pretty and you can't see a lot of pretty through the command line
18:35  vxla: sigh
18:35  Necrosand: Wow
18:35  Necrosand: You really need some education, Macstheyjustsuck
18:36  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: I'm implying that command lines are faster in a lot of situations
18:36  vxla: Go read this: <http://simson.net/ref/ugh.pdf>
18:36  vxla: it's dated, but a good reference study in why unix as a whole sucks
18:36  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: and they shouldn't have "died out" or however Branes put it
18:36  Macstheyjustsuck: Doesn't Mac = Unix? o.O
18:36  Macstheyjustsuck: Oh nevermind
18:36  Macstheyjustsuck: Sorry XD
18:36  vxla: Macstheyjustsuck: they shouldn't die out because the alternative (no GUI) doesn't offer functionality in a way people want.
18:37 +Branes: The only reason commandlines survive is that it gives otherwise-spineless humans a false sense of mastery and an illusion of superiority.
18:37  Macstheyjustsuck: vxla: GUis own, they're a lot better for a lot of things
18:38  Macstheyjustsuck: Learning to use both would make you a winnar.
18:38 +Branes: Prompt-lovers are inately incapable of real-world human-to-human interaction, and resort to grasping for some semblance of mastery at *anything*.
18:38  vxla: Branes: now now, there's situations where we're forced to have that sense because vnedors are too inept at offering a good product.
18:38  Necrosand: Branes: I digress.
18:38 +Branes: You need to be suffering Aspergers or OCD (or both) to actually see any merit in a commandline interface.
18:38  claude2:  <+Branes> The only reason commandlines survive is that it gives otherwise-spineless humans a  false sense of mastery and an illusion of superiority.
18:38  vxla: too general a statement
18:39  claude2: no need to get insulting Branes 
18:39  claude2: lets keep this civilized
18:39  rayfinkle: dude. the command line is the most usefull part of the os for a lot of us. particularly admins and programmers
18:39  vxla: What programmer codes on a command line these days? okay, besides C/C++ programmers
18:39 +Branes: If you find what I state to be insulting, good -- it means I am challenging one of your most deeply-held beliefs, and I find them wrong.
18:39  vxla: news flash: everyone else actually uses tools with debuggers built in
18:39  rayfinkle: vxla: the os is written in c/c++/obj-c
18:39  Macstheyjustsuck: Branes: Seeing as they're faster in a lot of situations, I disagree.
18:40  Macstheyjustsuck: Saying that they suck when they can do things better is retarded.
18:40 +Branes: See Kay's First Law.
18:40  vxla: rayfinkle: do you really think apple developers use vi in a terminal?
18:40  rayfinkle: vxla: not true. even ruby on rails guys refer the command line
18:40  Macstheyjustsuck: Kay's first law is retarded.
18:40  rayfinkle: vxla: no they use an ide and debug with command line tools. i know plenty of them
18:40  Macstheyjustsuck: It's encouraging people to not learn, I don't like that :[
18:40  vxla: rayfinkle: I have 10 devs sitting near me. guys with 20+ years of experience who actually write code. they would kill themselves if they had to go back to writing the "old way"
18:41  vxla: but I guess it's all preference.
18:41  Macstheyjustsuck: IDEs are much more efficient, using a command line for something where you're paid to write code would be :O
18:41 +Branes: You haven't used Marten then.
18:41  vxla: these guys make products that people pay for and dno't have time to sit around and fuck with gdb
18:41  rayfinkle: you must be sitting with java/c# guys :)
18:41 +Branes: Programming that is 100% visual.
18:41  vxla: rayfinkle: uh, no.
18:41  rayfinkle: ok who then
18:42  Macstheyjustsuck: C++ ftw
18:42  vxla: C/C++ and low level languages
18:42  vxla: lots of assembly still
18:42  vxla: they're making products that are passing your packets right now.
18:42  Macstheyjustsuck: lol at whoever sent me the link about how Unix sucks, the chapter names make me chuckle :]
18:43  rayfinkle: to each his own. i use slickedit for c++ textmate for ruby emacs for perl intellij for java and so on but i always go back to the cl when debugging, compiling installing etc
18:43  vxla: rayfinkle: well while you're doing that, we're making money.
18:43  vxla: good luck tho :)
18:43  rayfinkle: erm k. that's just a rediculous comment
18:44  ayaz: Indeed.
18:44  Macstheyjustsuck: gvim for writing, g++ for compiling, that's the winner's way!
18:44  vxla: whats that sound? just the competition going by as people waste time unecessarily.
18:44 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v JonathanD]
18:44  vxla: hmm, I guess that should have been hyphenated.
18:44  js_: i love wasting time necessarily
18:44  js_: :O
18:44  vxla: :)
18:45  js_: i used to love terminals everywhere too, until i grew up
18:45  Macstheyjustsuck:  ^
18:45  Macstheyjustsuck: Terminals for everything is just way too much
18:46  vxla: I mean, I'd give an arm or a leg for a WYSE terminal that only ran at 9600 over serial lines, but I can't find 'em anymore. The new ones have those crappy keyboards too.
18:46  js_: yeah, keyboards suck
18:46  js_: and what is this "mouse" thing i've heard about?
18:47  Macstheyjustsuck: I program with punch cards.
18:47  Macstheyjustsuck: The way real men program.
18:47  vxla: right here, this was the end of computing:
18:47  vxla: <http://www.wyse.com/service/support/kbase/images/w50pimg.gif>
18:47  vxla: I hated that damn orange
18:48  rayfinkle: eh that's fortran, i'm way cooler. with my needle and 5.24" floppy
18:48  vxla: rayfinkle: you had 5.24" floppies? wow, certainly unique!
18:48  rayfinkle: typo fool
18:48 +Branes: Get out of my light, you lot, I can't see the flip-switches.
18:48  rayfinkle: lol
18:48  vxla: rayfinkle: sounds like the only fool here is you
18:48  Macstheyjustsuck: You haven't corrected yourself yet.
18:48  Macstheyjustsuck: For all we know you still mean 5.24"
18:49  Macstheyjustsuck: :]
18:49  rayfinkle: :)
18:49  vxla: he's too busy debugging in gdb
18:49  Macstheyjustsuck: eck
18:52  Macstheyjustsuck: So has anyone here ever programmed in D?
18:52  rayfinkle: yup. it's nice
18:52  rayfinkle: really liking google go lately though
18:52  Macstheyjustsuck: :O Whoever named it is an ass
18:52  Macstheyjustsuck: Google Go?
18:53  Macstheyjustsuck: Eww (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29)
18:54  Macstheyjustsuck: The code doesn't look pretty :[
18:54  rayfinkle: the new c++0x standard has some really nice features. gcc 5.6 implements most of it
18:55  rayfinkle: er 4.6
18:57  ahihi: piling features on top of each other doesn't make a very good language
18:57  Macstheyjustsuck: Yeah, can't wait for C++0x :] There's a lot of things that I figure'd I would do eventually that wouldn't work in C++03 but would in 0x
18:57  ahihi: and that's essentially how C++ was born :(
18:57  Macstheyjustsuck: Everyone hates on C++ :[
18:57  vxla: ahihi: have you heard of Cb (C-flat)? It's pretty bad...some people refer to it as perl. lol
18:57  vxla: it's halfway between broken scripting and broken programming.
18:58  ahihi: sounds delightful
18:58 * ahihi mostly writes Haskell (and C when necessary)
