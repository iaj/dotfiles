08:37  Polysics: hello
08:37 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 97 seconds
08:37  Polysics: is anyone having a LOT of system freezes? ie. gray screen of death
08:37  MariusAZ: No
08:38  Polysics: i am on a mid-2010 MBP 17", i7, 8Gb
08:38  MariusAZ: That's usually indicative of a hardware problem
08:38  Polysics: 500Gb/7200
08:38  MariusAZ: Did you upgrade memory recently?
08:38  Polysics: the system check says nothing
08:38  Polysics: and memory is factory-shipped
08:38  musicanna: any firmware updates or anything that you missed or installed?
08:38  Polysics: there is an EFI firmware update that SHOULD be targeting my machine but i cannot install
08:39  Polysics: musicanna, that is what i was thinking of, but i do not know how to check
08:39  MariusAZ: Why won't it?
08:39  Polysics: software update reports no new software
08:39  MariusAZ: Then it doesn't apply to your model
08:39  MariusAZ: That's common
08:40  Polysics: MariusAZ, it is listed as an upgrade for my machine, but it won't install - maybe it just targets a specific hw revision
08:40  MariusAZ: If it's not hardware related, then something is borked with the OS
08:40  Polysics: can problems like that be caused by software?
08:40  Polysics: i will be honest, the stuff more or less started after i installed an *ahem* imported version of Photoshop
08:40  Polysics: which i now removed, btw
08:40  MariusAZ: There's other files that it installs all over the hard drive
08:41  MariusAZ: Did you use the setup program to uninstall it?
08:41  Polysics: no, and it might have been an horrible mistake 
08:41  Polysics: i just removed the apps
08:41  MariusAZ: That's probably it, reinstall it 
08:41  MariusAZ: And then uninstall it with the installer
08:41  musicanna: :O worth a try
08:42  Polysics: can software actually cause kernel panics?
08:43  MariusAZ: Typically no, but Adobe does some strange stuff
08:43  eagles0513875|2: its possible
08:44  eagles0513875|2: MariusAZ: depends on how well the program is designed no?
08:44  Polysics: tbh, after brutally removing it, the machine hasn't panicked yet
08:44  Polysics: i will try to push it a little
08:44  eagles0513875|2: i would reinstall and use the uninstall 
08:44  Polysics: how do i display temperature on my toolbar, btw?
08:44  Polysics: that's something else i wanted to check
08:45  eagles0513875|2: i uses istat pro widget
08:45  Polysics: is there a way to see the temperature without installing anything? i would like to remove variables from the equation
08:46  Polysics: a window is ok, no need for toolbar
08:46  eagles0513875|2: ahh humm
08:46  eagles0513875|2: not sure 
08:46  Tomis: toolbar?
08:46  Polysics: Tomis, yes, a widget or something
08:46  eagles0513875|2: Tomis: i think he means widget like istat pro which i have that gives me temps and more
08:46  Tomis: tooblars are things attached to windows, right under their titlebars
08:47  Tomis: the thing at the top of the screen with the menus, that's the menubar
08:47  Polysics: ok, real question is "can i see my mbp's temp sensors anywhere, without installing anything new?"
08:47  Polysics: if it's no it is ok, just wanted to be sure
08:47  Tomis: there's nothing built-in to show the system's temp sensors afaik
08:47  eagles0513875|2: Tomis: what bout the istat pro widget 
08:47  eagles0513875|2: i am using that and it seems to do the job 
08:48  Tomis: that's not built-in eagles0513875|2 
08:48  eagles0513875|2: ahh ok 
08:48  Tomis: man, i'm diggin this, i started using the ratings in itunes to denote the "speed" of songs
08:48  Tomis: and now i've got smart playlists based around that
08:49  Polysics: i must say that removing photoshop, even if it was done wrong, probably actually DID something
08:49  Tomis: the system started acting weird after uninstal?
08:49  Polysics: but thinking of it, i have used the machine with PS for a whil and had no kernel panics
08:49  Polysics: Tomis, no, it is working properly after it :-)
08:50  Polysics: i am stressing it with three HD videos from Youtube, no problems
08:50  Polysics: so far at least
08:50  Polysics: lesson learned, bu ysoftware :-(
08:50  Tomis: i uninstalled flash recently
08:50  Polysics: at least for now
08:51  Tomis: installed the youtube5 extension to force loading of some video sites into html5 containers
08:51  Tomis: same content, new lower CPU usage!
08:51  Polysics: i wouldn't blame flash, was jsut saying that it is probably the most intensive app i have to test the machine
08:52  Tomis: run the yes command on an infinite loop
08:53  MariusAZ: How many cores you have?
08:53  Polysics: 4
08:53  Polysics: i7
08:53  Tomis: 2 physical, 4 virtual
08:53  MariusAZ: so 2
08:53  MariusAZ: do yes > /dev/null && yes > /dev/null
08:54  MariusAZ: That'll start to push it
08:54  Polysics: ok, no, it just froze again
08:54  Tomis: i'm running 4 "yes"s and it's only hitting 25-30% MariusAZ 
08:54  Polysics: hardware issue :-8
08:54  Tomis: i'm disapointed!
08:55  MariusAZ: Try 4 separate terminal windows
08:55  Tomis: i did
08:55  Jordan_U: MariusAZ: You mean "yes > /dev/null & yes > /dev/null" (only one '&')
08:55  Tomis: oh there we go!
08:56  MariusAZ: Jordan_U:  What's the difference between & and &&?
08:56  MariusAZ: I can't remember
08:56  Tomis: yea running it like MariusAZ said really kicked it up
08:56  Jordan_U: foo && bar runs foo, and if foo exits with sucess (exit code 0), runs bar.
08:56  MariusAZ: Ahh, that's right
08:57  Tomis: woo 97% usage
08:57  Tomis: the fans aren't even kicking up!
08:57  Jordan_U: Tomis: Now do something graphics intensive as well :)
08:57  Tomis: like what
08:57  Tomis: it's a mac
08:57  Tomis: there's nothing graphics intensive to run
08:57  Tomis:  /ohsnap
08:58  Jordan_U: They have a nice graphing calculator :)
08:58  MariusAZ: There's a thing that'll run raytrace with GPU acceleration that taxes the hell out of it
08:58  MariusAZ: Umm, I can't remember what it's called now
08:59  Tomis: why is Grapher still in the Utilities folder, i don't understand that move apple
08:59  Polysics: so, hardware issue it is?
08:59  MariusAZ: smalluxGPU
09:00  Polysics: aside from PS, there are no other "special" apps installed, aside from mysql and ruby with rvm
09:00  Polysics: and that stuff doesn't look like it can cause anything

09:17  eagles0513875|2: i have a squeaky enter key
09:17  S_SubZero: ok
09:18  eagles0513875|2: lol
09:23  Tomis: woa, too much info, that's something you should only discuss with your wife and your doctor
09:25  eagles0513875|2: lol Tomis
09:38  eagles0513875|2: holy shit 
09:38  eagles0513875|2: crucial has an 8gb kit for my mbp
09:38  eagles0513875|2: 150$
09:40  Tomis: yea, i'm waiting for those to come down more
09:41  Tomis: would be nice if they actually support 16GB, but just haven't been tested against the currently non-existant 8GB sticks
09:41  eagles0513875|2: im not gonna upgrade just yet 
09:41  eagles0513875|2: im gonna wait as well 
09:41  eagles0513875|2: 4gb is serving my needs nicely so far :) 
09:42  eagles0513875|2: if i get into super heavy dev work then i might upgrade
09:42  Tomis: yea i'm already starting to page a little bit
09:42  eagles0513875|2: im not yet 
09:43  eagles0513875|2: but only when i play world of warcraft with some non memory intensive programs running i get some paging even with 4gb
09:45  Tomis: hmmm
09:45  Tomis: i really don't want to buy an apple router
09:45  eagles0513875|2: lol
09:45  eagles0513875|2: why would you need to 
09:45  Tomis: but i think i want wireless backups
09:45  eagles0513875|2: ahh
09:45  eagles0513875|2: time machine Tomis?
09:45  Tomis: yea
09:46  Tomis: having to keep plugging the laptop in is kinda a pain
09:46  eagles0513875|2: but wifi is slow 
09:46  eagles0513875|2: why not get a mac mini with osx server 
09:46  eagles0513875|2: and just wire it to the network and wire the laptop to do the back up
09:46  Tomis: because that's an even bigger waste, lol
09:46  eagles0513875|2: i know 
09:46  Tomis: the idea is to eliminate the wires
09:46  eagles0513875|2: if i had the money i think i would buy a mac osx server lol
09:46  Tomis: even if the backup takes longer
09:47  eagles0513875|2: true
09:47  Tomis: i just loathe apple's routers
09:47  Tomis: they're over priced and poorly designed
09:48  eagles0513875|2: im quite impressed i have my desktop connected to my network using ethernet over power 200mbps over cat 6
09:48  eagles0513875|2: im impressed with the performance of ethernet over power
09:48  Tomis: what's the power being used for?
09:49  eagles0513875|2: its those things you plug into ur electrical sockets then plug the ethernet into and you get connectivity over the electrical circuit in the house
09:49  Tomis: the whole idea of PoE is to lessen the cabling needed for ... OH
09:49  Tomis: gotcha
09:49  eagles0513875|2: i have the server in my room router and modem in another room
09:49  Tomis: thought you were talking about power over ethernet, heh
09:49  eagles0513875|2: no no hehe
09:49  eagles0513875|2: i need to update my networking infrastructure
09:49  Tomis: how do they keep the data from leeking into the electric grid?
09:49  Tomis: i never understood that
09:49  eagles0513875|2: hehe me neither
09:51  Tomis: well after getting this MBP i hardly touch my imac
09:51  Polysics: i am running a top of apps, now, no freezing for a while.... i am stumped
09:51  Polysics: not reliably getting freezes in any way = wtf :-)
09:51  Tomis: backup, wipe, reinstal Polysics 
09:51  Tomis: test the crap out of it on a clean instal
09:51  Tomis: if it still freezes, it's hardware
09:51  Polysics: god idea
09:52  Polysics: or should i just go to an apple store?
09:52  Tomis: i'd do the reinstal step first
09:52  Polysics: will they do the same things i can do and charge me for it? :-)
09:52  Tomis: they wont' charge you for it if it's under warranty no
09:52  Tomis: have you run the hardware test from the system DVD yet?
09:53  Tomis: pop disk in, boot holding D
09:53  Tomis: run the extended test, takes about an hour
09:53  Polysics: yes, nothing shows up
09:53  Tomis: damn
09:53  Polysics: CPU at 70°, is it normal?
09:53  Polysics: 71° C
09:53  eagles0513875|2: O_o
09:53  Tomis: what's that in american
09:53  Tomis: heh
09:54  Polysics: going up, it is at 75 now
09:54  eagles0513875|2: super hot 
09:54  eagles0513875|2: ill brb 
09:54  Polysics: 167
09:54  Tomis: 167?!
09:54  Tomis: you better be cranking that machine
09:54  Polysics: 75 C = 167 F, running 1080p video on Youtube
09:54  Tomis: if it's hitting that temp idling, something is up
09:54  Tomis: oh no wonder
09:54  Polysics: past 180 F now
09:54  Tomis: flash needs to die, seriously
09:55  Tomis: waste of freaking CPU cycles i swear
09:55  Polysics: ok, so it is not unusual for what the machine is doing?
09:55  Tomis: adobe should be sued for wasting the world's electricity
09:55  Tomis: take a reading of the machine idling
09:56  Polysics: reached 190 F O_o
09:56  Polysics: and fans are not speeding up, always around 2k rpm
09:56  Tomis: mine usually idles around 110 F
09:56  Tomis: yea apple laptops run hot
09:56  Tomis: apple chooses not to ramp the fans up until they *really* need to
09:57  Polysics: hot is ok for me as long as it is normal-ish
09:58  Polysics: closed browser window, now waiting for the cpu to cool down al ittle
09:58  Tomis: when i'm doing intensive stuff i put the laptop on a cooling fan i rigged up, heh
09:58  Polysics: but yeah, i would say it does idle at around 45C/113F
09:59  Tomis: yea that sounds normal then
09:59  Tomis: eagles0513875|2: 8GB kits are $134 on newegg w/ free shipping http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007609+600000401&QksAutoSuggestion=&ShowDeactivatedMark=False&Configurator=&IsNodeId=1&Subcategory=381&description=&Ntk=&CFG=&SpeTabStoreType=&srchInDesc=
09:59  Polysics: i would blame the RAM with almost 100% accuracy, tbh, even if hw test didn't say anything
09:59  Tomis: ram is the easiest to fix too Polysics 
09:59  Polysics: hard freeze, unreliable re-enactment of incidents
09:59  Tomis: so if it's hardware you really want it to be ram
09:59  Polysics: not temperature related
10:00  Polysics: i do not see any other possibilites
10:00  Polysics: ok, running time machine now, the nwiping the machine
10:00  Tomis: i'd think if it were ram the extended hardware test would have detected it
10:00  Polysics: aple forums have 90 pages of people wuth the same problem
10:01  Polysics: apparently Apple doesn't know my model is affected too, because they do have an EFI update up
10:01  Polysics: but it doesn't install on my machine
10:02  Polysics: let's hope it doesn't decide to blow up while i back up
10:36  Polysics: ok, i just got the final proof that the problem is hardware :-/
10:37  Polysics: the machine just crashed at the login screen
10:41  Tomis: did you do the clear instal yet?
10:42  Tomis: it could just be some wacky 3rd party kernel extension at this point
10:42  Psixerces: Polysics, crashing at, or before the login screen doesn't mean its hardware.
10:42  Psixerces: Just means the current os could be fubar'd - hence why you need a clean install to test it
10:42  Psixerces: as for the temp - what model mac are you talking about>
10:43  Psixerces: and was it a html5 youtube, or flash youtube page?
10:43  Psixerces: I have had mbp's up to 100 C before because of flash youtube etc
10:44  Psixerces: that mbp is about 3 years old though
10:46  Polysics: Psixerces, flash youtube, mid-2010 i7 MBP
10:47 --- nchase_ is now known as nchase
10:47  Psixerces: flash would explain why its running hot.
10:47  Psixerces: I don't know what the i7 is meant to run at however, but I wouldn't worry about 75 deg to much
10:48  Psixerces: I have a last gen and it runs up to 80 under a heavy load
10:48  Polysics: crowning prize is that i seem to be missing my install DVD :-(
10:48  Polysics: ok, i suck at this
10:48  Polysics: should have stuck to linux :-)
10:49  Psixerces: do you have another mac there?
10:56  eagles0513875|2: Polysics: no you shouldnt 
10:56  eagles0513875|2: someone told me that there is no  power management
10:57  Jordan_U: There is certainly power management.
10:58  Jordan_U: And I have never seen the claim that the CPU is not underclocked when it needs to be substantiated.
11:07  harpal: I have MAC OSX 10.6 on my Laptop. I have an application in which I want to temporary disable Command, Control keys
11:08  harpal: is there any ways I can do it? not through UI/
11:08  Tomis: system prefs>keyboard>modifier keys
11:08  Tomis: that's the only way i know of
11:09  harpal: Tomis: oh okay,

13:00  iaj: hi there.. how can I get rid of the "Some warning occured- Would you like to review them now" message in pages and keynote and so on?
13:02  Tomis: review them? maybe it'll stop bugging you
13:02 --- koro_ is now known as koro
13:02  Tomis: is that something that happens when you import documents from another format?
13:06  iaj: well I usually get those documents from other guys - and I get that message all the time :\
13:06  iaj: its crying about missing fonts and so on :\
13:37  simion314: is it possible to increase the font size in the terminal?
13:38  topriddy: hi
13:38  DoFoT9: hey simion314 yes it is
13:39  topriddy: any plug-in for safari browser to allow stuffs downloading to be resumable? some stuffs simply dont allow launching of an external download manager, and it tires me
13:39  DoFoT9: simion314: preferences->settings (tab)->click the "change" bottom on the Font section
13:39  DoFoT9: hey shineymyers
13:46  simion314: DoFoT9: thx
13:46  DoFoT9: no probs
13:49  Angostura: topriddy: Most downloads I come across these days, are  resumable
13:51  topriddy: i am downloading the blackberry theme studio plugin
14:08  Tomis: safari supports resumable downloads topriddy 
14:08  topriddy: Tomis: have you ever tried iGetter before?
14:08  Tomis: if the downlaod can't be resumed, it's because the server in question doesn't support it
14:11  topriddy: Tomis: the server in question - I suspect may not support it, but iGetter gives an impression that it can resume most downloads, also for some reason i dont understand, iGetter is tons faster than the safari download plugin
14:12  Tomis: the idea behind download accelerators is that they abuse that partial download functionality
14:12  Tomis: they open multiple sockets to the server requesting the file in several peices
14:14  topriddy: but the way the download request thing is presented in the site, i am using, i dont have a download url directly as such (i guess they store info in sessions), hence i cannot d/load through iGetter
14:15  Tomis: huh?
14:15  topriddy: Tomis: i agree with you partially...but where am from internet is very slow....iGetter gives me an average of 32kb/sec while safari d/load browser offers a meagre 9kb/sec////downloading 350MB of software i need which is unresumable takes forever
14:15  Angostura: topriddy: But if you go into Safari > Windows Downloads does it give you the 'refresh' arrow next to the download?
14:15  Angostura: If so, you can resume
14:15  topriddy: Angostura: it doesn't 
14:15  Tomis: you can copy the URL from the safari downloads window topriddy 
14:16  Angostura: topriddy: URL of download is?
14:16  Tomis: select the item in the downloads window, do Edit>Copy
14:16  Tomis: it will copy the URL to the file
14:16  Tomis: then you can hit stop and paste it into your download accelerator of choice
14:16  topriddy: Tomis: its a session thingy...i believe the web app, stores some associated data and then checks if you agreed to download, cookies etc before initiating downloaf
14:17 @ChrisAM: curl supports resuming... try that.
14:17  Tomis: yea, makes sense
14:19  topriddy: Tomis: the url i get is https://www.blackberry.com/Downloads/downloadFile
14:19 @ChrisAM: what are you trying to download?
14:19  Tomis: the bastards
14:19  topriddy: hence the url info must have been provided or stored indirecty somewhere a pretty where of hiding it
14:21  topriddy: Tomis: I said it earlier - hehehe. I am a programmer and understand that they didnt implement it directly
14:21  Tomis: so they're using cookies or variables in the GET request to determine what file they serve you
14:21  topriddy: ChrisAM: I am trying to download the Blackberry theme studio thing, i am learning bb development and stuffs
14:21  Tomis: see if there's some accelerator add on for firefox maybe
14:21  topriddy: Tomis: yeah...that is wise i guess
14:21  Tomis: something that can over-ride the default behavior and give you what you need
14:21  Tomis: or a download manager with a built-in mini-browser
14:22  topriddy: yeah...thanks...i appreciate you guys making effort to help address my issue
14:22 @ChrisAM: topriddy ... I've got less than a minute on the download... I can put it on my server and you can grab it from me.
14:23  topriddy: ChrisAM: seriously?
14:23  topriddy: the blackberry theme studio thing?

14:24 @ChrisAM: gah... I just realized I downloaded the exe... is there an OS X version?
14:24  topriddy: ChrisAM: thanks in advance...
14:24  Crum: I have never owned a mac before but I'm interested. Can you customize your own mac? Like lets say I want to have a raid 0 system with 10 HD's. Can I do this with mac?

15:13 @ChrisAM: We're a fairly small security team. I also head up the incident response team and manage the DLP program.
15:15  FriedBob: Next semester I will be starting on my Masters in Forensic Accounting. Really looking forward to that.
15:15  vxla: what does a masters in FA do?
15:16  FriedBob: FA is all about finding out how a fraud was done - so charges can be pressed, and controls put in place to prevent it in the future
15:17  vxla: ahh, gotcha. 
15:17  vxla: wasn't sure if it specifically tied to an industry
15:17  FriedBob: No more so than forensic IT. :)
15:17 @ChrisAM: FriedBob ... we need people like you.
15:18  FriedBob: ChrisAM: I live in the midwest right now, but DM me somewhere I can apply, and I will talk to my wife.
15:18 @ChrisAM: We've got an opening right now for Director of Quantitative Analytics
15:21  vxla: FriedBob: where are you in the mw? i'm in Chicago.
15:22  FriedBob: vxla: Sedalia, MO
15:22  vxla: nice. outside the winter ice cap? :)
15:22  vxla: i'm always amazed at how much nicer a climate St. Louis is
15:23  FriedBob: Been in the 70s here there last few days.
15:23  vxla: it hit 60-ish yesterday here, but by now the concrete is so cold that if you're not in the sun, it still feels chill.
15:23  vxla: s/chill/chilly/

15:33  formite: hi.. shh.. element, element! :)
15:34  FriedBob: My breakfast was from Idaho... does that count?
15:34  LaraX: I have a Google Map My Map of places I've visited (and lived) marked, I need to fix it but it doesn't even put them in alphabetical order or anything. I might need to export it to Google Earth maybe
15:34 * vxla wants to see that.
15:34  LaraX: Idaho potatoes?
15:34  FriedBob: LaraX: Aye.
15:35  vxla: breakfast sounds good right now. The problem with working from home is that I never have morning foods.
15:35  vxla: pad thai in the morning doesn't do it for me.
15:35 @ChrisAM: pad thai sounds frickin awesome right now
15:35  FriedBob: vxla: I worked from home for the last 2 years.... NEVER missed a breakfast.
15:36  FriedBob: Duck Choo Chee or however it is spelled, sounds better to me. 
15:36  vxla: ChrisAM: pad thai and tom yum with a bottle of soju last night. mmm.
15:37  FriedBob: I made risotto last night. My first time, but it turned out very well
15:39 @ChrisAM: I brought home leftover pizza hut pizza from a lunch meeting.
15:40  LaraX: vxla: I started making this a few years ago before things were updated and now many of them say "Placemark undefined" but aren't supposed to (didn't used to), need to add more places if I'm including everywhere I've touched land (like driven through), or I need to remove irrelevant places, and alphabetize them, or just start over with a new map... http://goo.gl/maps/oWlj
15:41  vxla: Excellent. But you've denied us middle-coasters your presence! 
15:42  vxla: I did something like that with one of those fancy Facebook applications that probably stole my identity.
15:42  LaraX: yeah, like Chicago :)
15:44  LaraX: Facebook's map might work better for all I know but I'm not on that site (yet?)
15:45  spline: yet
15:47  LaraX: yeah, people want me to join...
15:47  LaraX: still trying to decide if I should close my myspace account which I don't use but it says the site is going to be updated so waiting for that
15:48  spline: the larax fan club! :)
15:48  LaraX: yeah right :p
15:48  FriedBob: I can't even get into my myspace - I don't remember the password, and what's more, I can't remember what email I used at the time
15:49  Kasm279|Away: FriedBob: well, hit the recovery button and proceed to go through all your accounts
15:49  Kasm279|Away: im not on myspace, only facebook
15:49  Kasm279|Away: well
15:49  Kasm279|Away: i am on myspace
15:49  Kasm279|Away: but have only one friend and never go on
15:49  Kasm279|Away: im out, later
15:49  LaraX: Tom?
15:51  LaraX: this map should be organized by country or state at least... something!
15:51  LaraX: come on google
15:51  spline: or fire up earth
15:51  vxla: google maps is horrible with that.
15:53  LaraX: yeah
15:54  LaraX: spline: I think you can export this data as some file, import it into Google Earth, reorganize, import it back? hopefully
15:55  spline: kml
15:55  spline: its the new thing
15:55  vxla: you can, but it might not be any better. just pass it around as a kml file
15:55  spline: I do models with it not so much anymore
15:55  spline: yeah
15:55  spline: KML is awesome. I recall google maps even imports it now
15:55  spline: but doing any basic scripting in php/python/etc you can do some awesome layers/things
15:56  LaraX: vxla: but not everyone has or would want to open Google Earth to see it. web based would be better
15:56  spline: LaraX: that's why I recall google earth can read it natively now, without converting it
15:56  zer0her0: LaraX: i'm herenow
15:56  spline: I haven't check that lately. I do the work on the backend
15:56  LaraX: zer0her0: hi, was going to say I saw your sites the other day and they were nice
15:57  zer0her0: ah thanks :)
15:57  vxla: this was made with exports to kml and into google maps. <http://tinyurl.com/2vjd8by>
15:57  LaraX: there was one problem I noticed but closed them now
15:57  LaraX: you're welcome :)
15:57  vxla: spline: I did notice that google maps runs out of pointers when creating a map in the web interface. somewhere around 3000 points.
15:58  LaraX: vxla: yeah I need to learn how to do things like that
15:58  zer0her0: and time for meeting.
15:58  zer0her0: if you can find it or let me know what it was, it would be awesome
15:59  spline: vxla: that's why they use.. forget the thing.. but interpolation @ certain levels
15:59  spline: it had this 4 years ago when I first got into it
15:59  spline: you had to do it manually, but I recall they added this to the API in 2008 
15:59  spline: so if you have 4k data points, you don't have 4k points on a screen. I was doing numbers upward on that just looking @ state level
15:59  spline: but some folks had many, many, many more
16:00  spline: im forgetting the name. it does the same stuff games do when you view "a lot of stuff" from a distance so you don't get overloaded
16:00  LaraX: zer0her0: ok, later
16:02  spline: vxla: yeah, I was drawing points like that when we had someone who was mapping delivery/targeted stuff

16:09 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 107 seconds
16:10  ayaz: jeroenh: Could you be talking about 'inotify'?
16:10  LaraX: it lets you reorganize them manually but that doesn't help much
16:12  jeroenh: ayaz: it's something like that, I remember that it was a really simple utility for OS X, you gave it two arguments, the filename and the script to execute
16:12  ayaz: jeroenh: Or, perhaps, it is the 'fswatch' utility, but I've never used it myself.
16:44  diamonds: how to make just b/w print
16:44  diamonds: is this a printer drive thing?
16:44  diamonds: *driver
16:44  diamonds: ohh...nm
16:45  diamonds: there is a dropdown where I expected tabs

16:51  cgtdk: So true
16:56  LzrdKing: i have to agree with that image
17:04  torchie: omg they cost moooooore
17:04  torchie: i didnt knooooooow
17:04  torchie: apple why have you betrayed meeeeeee
17:06  zer0her0: what a waste of a morning
17:07  LzrdKing: significantly more
17:07  FriedBob: zer0her0: That's what she said.
17:08  zer0her0: FriedBob: heh
17:08  FriedBob: zer0her0: Do you have the new CoD, or are you getting it?
17:09  zer0her0: FriedBob: i don't have it yet
17:09  FriedBob: I still don't even have Reach. :(
17:09  zer0her0: i'm thinking bout it, trying to play through my backlog of games personally
17:10  FriedBob: I need to finish Red Dead still. I may do that later today. I've barely been able to play anything since I started working again
17:10  zer0her0: i'll prob pick it up tomorrow @ work
17:10  LzrdKing: backlog of life
17:10  zer0her0: as i just found out i have all thursday off
17:10  zer0her0: LzrdKing: actually i'm not that backlogged on life
17:10  LzrdKing: i am
17:11  FriedBob: Nice. My schedule changes each week. :/ Every other weekend off though
17:13  zer0her0: FriedBob: nice
17:13  zer0her0: yea i'm finally on a somewhat regular schedule, though my second job has changed a bit so i maybe a touch crazy again
17:15  FriedBob: zer0her0: I'm in a training period now, so my schedule mirrors the department manager of whichever department I am in.
17:16  zer0her0: yea for what 6 weeks?
17:16  zer0her0: i keep thinking it's only 3 week training cycle but it's higher
17:17  FriedBob: 3 weeks per department
17:17  FriedBob: 4 departments total
17:17  zer0her0: oh geez
17:17  zer0her0: 12 weeks
17:17  zer0her0: that's crazy long, but i guess if you're going to be training people it makes sense?
17:18  FriedBob: I'm gonna be managing a department. This is their excelerated program since they are opening so many stores so quickly
17:19  zer0her0: gotcha
17:21  FriedBob: 6 stores in the spring, 15-20 by the end of '12
17:24  zer0her0: how many stores total?
17:25  FriedBob: 250ish right now
17:27  zer0her0: ah not bad
17:28  FriedBob: Lowes and Home Depot are bigger right now, but I don't think it will stay that way for more than a few more years.
17:29  zer0her0: Lowes++ Home Depot--
17:29  zer0her0: :)
17:29  torchie: I heard lowes was for girls
17:29  torchie: GIIIIIIIIIIIIRLS
17:29  LaraX: neither are
17:29  torchie: (giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirls)
