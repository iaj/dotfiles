01:36  Pyista42: MultiFinder: new actually 
01:36  Pyista42: friend has one sealed hes trying to sell me 
01:36  Pyista42: but it seems like the unit is going to update here in the next few months, and i will buy a pro when they do that but i need something to hold me off :P 
01:36  Pyista42: 2.4 ghz c2d should be ok for photoshop and i can use an external monitor if i get irritiated of screen size
01:36  Pyista42: but
01:36  Pyista42: 1280x800 is not *to* bad 
01:37  Pyista42: although i noticed on the macbook air 13 they put 1440 900 in there but i think thats the max res you can use with that size, i think now is when 10.7 will support resolution indpendence 
01:38  phuzion: Pyista42: RAM and HDD in the macbook?
01:38  Pyista42: i guess default apple store
01:38  phuzion: 2GB, 250GB?
01:38  Pyista42: going to offer 750 
01:39  Pyista42: yep
01:39  Pyista42: i dont care about hd size 250 is more then enough 
01:39  Pyista42: 2 gb of ram scares me a little bit .....but i lived on 512 for a very long time
01:39  phuzion: Pyista42: $750 sounds good, you might be able to snag it for $700 depending on how desperate your friend is to get rid of it.
01:39  Pyista42: yea
01:39  phuzion: Pyista42: I went almost a year on a 15" MBP on 2GB of RAM, you'll be fine.
01:40  phuzion: Unless you're talking about running Final Cut Pro or something like that
01:40  Pyista42: I'm mostly just doing coda and photoshop cs3 
01:40  phuzion: you'll probably wanna bump the ram then
01:40  phuzion: but a 4GB kit can be had for like $70
01:41  Pyista42: hmm yea .....i mean i run ps on a work computer with 1 gb in windows and honestly its not bad 
01:41  Pyista42: cs3 i assume is less resourceful then cs4/cs5
01:42  Pyista42: my boss has access to any of them as he buys tons of licenses per year
01:42  Pyista42: I know cs5 has full mac 64 bit support, not sure if that would do anything if the machine does not have over 3 gb though right?
01:44  Pyista42: phuzion: i got a mac mini 1.8 ghz and i do final cut express on some 1-3 minute videos I don't see any issues, when would you know you need more ram?
01:45  phuzion: Pyista42: Basically, the more complex work you're doing, the more RAM you're going to meed.
01:45  phuzion: need*
01:45  phuzion: So, if you're editing a clip that's 30 seconds, and not putting much SFX into it, you could probably swing 2GB
01:46  Pyista42: i mean is a 2.4 ghz c2d enough for that?
01:46  phuzion: but if you're working on a 90 minute video with special effects like crazy, there's a reason Apple sells Mac Pros with 16GB RAM
01:46  phuzion: Pyista42: More than likely.
01:46  Pyista42: it does have a 320m for hd decoding 
01:48  Pyista42: but that steals from the ram heh 
01:48  Pyista42: phuzion: i will buy a brand new pro 17 inch when the new ones come out next month or feb heh
01:48  Pyista42: and i probably wont be doing any thing video related at all
01:49  Pyista42: and my photoshop files are usually under 100 mb 
01:52  dassouki: my friend reformatted my computer, and misspelled my username
01:52  dassouki: is there a way to change that ?

01:56  dassouki: yesterday
01:56  dassouki: and i installed
01:56  dassouki: a crap load of applications
01:56  dassouki: that i really don't feel like reinstalling

01:56 @ChrisAM: you'd be better off creating a new user that's spelled correctly and then deleting the other account.
01:57  phuzion: don't forget to promote the new account to an administrator account
01:57  dassouki: will all the applications be installed ?
01:57  alexlea: dassouki: i just got paid 30 bux to fix someone else computer who renamed their account and hten it screwed everything up
01:57 @ChrisAM: If they're in /Applications, yes.
01:58  dassouki: ok
01:58  dassouki: so what will i lose if anything?
01:58 @ChrisAM: any personalized settings
01:59  dassouki: well i'm buying a new hard drive in a month or so. I can perhaps survive this month
01:59 @ChrisAM: you can keep the old account around until you get everything set the way you like.
01:59  dassouki: that's true too
01:59  dassouki: i think i'll do that
01:59  dassouki: now when i get a new hard drive
01:59  dassouki: can i ghost my current hard drive and copy it onto the other one
01:59 @ChrisAM: yep... you can use Disk Utility to do that.
02:00  dassouki: awesome
02:00  dassouki: are CDRW upgradable to dvdrw ? 
02:00  dassouki: or is everything bolted in
02:00  snL20: why doesnt osx sl keep the universal access , ignore built-in trackpad while mouse keys on setting on reboot
02:00 @ChrisAM: how old is your mac? new ones will have a superdrive
02:00  dassouki: 1007
02:00  dassouki: 2007
02:01 @ChrisAM: it should have a superdrive, I think.
02:01  snL20: and is there anything I can do to make it so =)
02:01 @ChrisAM: Macbook?
02:01  dassouki: ya
02:02 @ChrisAM: ah... some models didn't come with it... you can swap the cdrw out for a superdrive
02:03  dassouki: cool so it's that that difficult 
02:03 @ChrisAM: snL20 ... I haven't used universal access... not sure how to troubleshoot.

02:04  dassouki: thanks
02:10  snL20: ChrisAM: well its the only way i've found for temporarily disabling the touchpad
02:10  dassouki: on my macbook does hte video memory stay at 64 mb or does it change based on demand
02:11 @ChrisAM: it's a fixed size
02:12  dassouki: and i assume there is no way to increase it now that i upgradd my memory to 4gb
02:15 @ChrisAM: nope
02:16  dassouki: that sucks
02:16  snL20: dassouki: I know on my mbp its 256 ... its using shared memory though iirc
02:19  snL20: dassouki: but it wont increase the vram to upgrade =)
02:21  dassouki: i mean on a pc video ram is a good big thing
02:24  snL20: dassouki: mainly cause pc's are more of a gamers platform :)
02:28  dassouki: ooh ok well i'm not much of a gamer, but hopefully 64 mb is good enough for videos and such
02:28 @ChrisAM: works well enough for me.
02:28  dassouki: or if i decide to do something with omni or inkspace
02:29  b3ny0-: I need an SSD in my mbp badly
02:29 @ChrisAM: so go buy one and install it.

02:30  b3ny0-: replacing dvd-burner with a storage drive too
02:31  dassouki: ChrisAM:  actually ack to my question earlier, can i replace my optical with an aditional hard drive

02:33  b3ny0-: oh good, was thinking of an 160gb SSD or bigger for OSX and 1tb for storage
02:33  b3ny0-: that should last one a while
02:33  dassouki: Berzerker: what am i looking for in the profiler
02:33  pgpkeys: thats weird. only 144MB?
02:34 +Berzerker: dassouki: that was directed towards pgpkeys 
02:34  pgpkeys: i'd have thought it would be something like 64/128/256
02:34 +Berzerker: dassouki: your answer is yes with the optibay, which b3ny0- linked
02:34 +Berzerker: pgpkeys: which mac do you have?

02:59  Gekz: so I have purchased a macbook pro, and it seems the battery lasts nowhere near 9 hours
02:59  Gekz: after one hour of use, it's saying that only 1 hour remains.
02:59 +Berzerker: is this new?
02:59  Gekz: yes
02:59 +Berzerker: you're doing something wrong
02:59  Gekz: straight out of box new
03:00 +Berzerker: what are you doing on the computer when testing?
03:00  snL20: b3ny0-: my mb is a GA-P55-USB3
03:00  Gekz: Berzerker: doing something wrong? Please, how can you possibly use a computer wrong to the point that it uses the battery 4x as fast as advertised.
03:00  Gekz: unless it means 9 hours idle
03:00  jlu: does anyone know if any current macbook pros support VT-d ?
03:00  Gekz: the CPU is currently around 50% per core 
03:00 +Berzerker: uhm
03:00 +Berzerker: yeah
03:00  Gekz: and the temp is around 77C 
03:00 +Berzerker: they mean 9 hours idle
03:00  dassouki: is there a reason why we can't get a 13 inch macbook pro
03:01  dassouki: wit i7
03:01 +Berzerker: welcome to marketing strategies
03:01  Gekz: 9 hours idle surely means more than 2 hours actually being used
03:01 +Berzerker: they mean 9 hours idle with everything disabled and the screen off
03:01  Gekz: ok, so now that I'm done with the troll, any sane responses?
03:01 +Berzerker: lol
03:01 +Berzerker: [sarcasm]yeah I totally just trolled you[/sarcasm]
03:02 +Berzerker: if the CPU is 50% per core, that's a decent amount of activity
03:02  snL20: Berzerker: hehe.. yeah I burned through the battery in 2 hours on my mbp playing bejeweled
03:02 +Berzerker: Gekz: what are you actually doing on the computer?

03:42  pgpkeys: ok, using Disk Utility how does it make a bootable repair image especially when the total data is larger than a single DVD? Since I didn't get any installation DVDs with this macbook (its used) I'm trying to figure out how to make a recovery set of disks of my current configuration so I can retore the drive if needed
03:42  pgpkeys: I have completed a Time Machine backup but thats a whopping 125GB!
03:45  Norrin: pgpkeys: "repair image" - just want a bootable environment with tools to fix problems?  can use an OSX install DVD for that. small compared to the 125GB TM backup
03:45  Norrin: different altogether. its not a backup. just install DVD with tools to help fix problems
03:45  pgpkeys: as i said, i didn't get any installation DVDs with this macbook
03:45  pgpkeys: i got it used
03:46  Norrin: pgpkeys: correct. but they're cheap I believe.  that's your option if you don't want ot do a TM restore
03:47 @ChrisAM: call apple and they'll send you a set for about $20
03:47  pgpkeys: well i'm thinking 'how can i restore this macbook to working condition if i dont have any installation DVDs. what tools out there will allow me to create a disk or setof disks that will either be a hardcopy of its current condition or will allow me to boot up and use Time Machine to restore the backup i just made'
03:48  pgpkeys: (other than using a bootable Acronis Image or something)
03:48 @ChrisAM: you can use Disk Utility to image your system to a USB drive
03:48  Norrin: if it won't boot, nothing is goign to give you a TM interface except an installation DVD
03:48  pgpkeys: chrisam: hmm, will have to see if thats viable. don't you have to have some sort of serial or something for OS X?
03:48 @ChrisAM: you just need the serial number from your hardware
03:48  Norrin: or somethign that does what that dvd does (puts OSX on a hdd for you)
03:49  pgpkeys: chrisam: where do I get that?
03:49 @ChrisAM: sticker on your mac
03:49  Norrin: pgpkeys: under the battery if macbook (remove it)
03:49 @ChrisAM: it's also in System Profiler
03:50  pgpkeys: ahh yeah just saw the serial there. thats what I need for the isntaller? or for Apple when I call?
03:50 @ChrisAM: you don't need a serial to install
03:50 @ChrisAM: but you'll just need to provide that to apple support and they'll send you the disks
03:50  Norrin: pgpkeys: and besides TM/DVD route, only other thing can think if is 100% copy, which is therefore 125GB in your case
03:50 @ChrisAM: You could just go buy the $29 snow leopard retail disc, but that won't come with iLife and iWork.
03:51  pgpkeys: ok, its creating a Macbook HD.dmg right now
03:51 @ChrisAM: creating a dmg won't do you any good
03:51  Norrin: oh good, this isn't Branes channel.  can actually give practical advise that isn't necessarily Apple approved
03:52  pgpkeys: ahh so its useless to create that dmg?
03:52  pgpkeys: damn. stopping the process then
03:52 @ChrisAM: it's ok if you want a backup, but if you want something bootable, you'll need to image it to a drive.
03:53  pgpkeys: yeah all I have is a 500GB Transcend StoreJet USB2 drive. 
03:53  pgpkeys: i've done the TM backup to that so far
03:54 @ChrisAM: If it were me, I'd get the replacement discs and keep using TM.
03:54  pgpkeys: and you said they're about 20 bucks?
03:54  pgpkeys: and I can use TM to restore right over a running system?
03:55  pgpkeys: (can't even do that with a rsync under linux without screwing things up)
03:55  djabbour: How do I start the OS X installer from the DVD while running OS X? I know there's some way to manually run the installer (I'm trying to instsall onto a secondary drive that's attached)
03:55 @ChrisAM: I've been fortunate enough never need to restore... and too ignorant to test my backups.
03:56  djabbour: I think I can just run the right .pkg off the install media
03:56  pgpkeys: chrisam: trying to cover my bases :)
03:56 @ChrisAM: djabbour ... hold down alt when you reboot and choose the cd to boot
03:56 @ChrisAM: djabbour ... the installer from within OS X just selects the CD as the boot device and restarts your mac.
03:56  djabbour: ChrisAM, no, I'm trying to run the installer application while running an already booted OS X
03:57  djabbour: ChrisAM, Without rebooting.
03:57 @ChrisAM: the installer doesn't run like that.
03:57  djabbour: ChrisAM, Yeah it does. I've done it
03:57 +Berzerker: no
03:57 +Berzerker: you can't do that.
03:57 @ChrisAM: then do it again
03:57  djabbour: ChrisAM, Once I figure it out again or someone here says how, i'll let you and Berzerker know.
03:58  djabbour: ChrisAM, Berzerker but I assure you with 100% certainty it's possible.
03:58 +Berzerker: try pacifism
03:58 +Berzerker: extracting the package installers and running them separately, that's the only way I can see
03:58  djabbour: nah I think i just kicked it off with one of the pkgs
03:58  djabbour: system/installer I think
03:58  djabbour: I'm poking around now.
03:59  djabbour: I also did it with 10.4. Not 10.5.
03:59  djabbour: Ah got it
03:59  djabbour: So if the DVD is mounted in /Volumes it'll be here: /Volumes/Mac OS X Install DVD/System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg
04:00 +Berzerker: ok, so you did what I told, just without a GUI
04:00  djabbour: no there's a gui
04:00 +Berzerker: and by GUI I meant pacifism
04:00  djabbour: it's the normal installer gui
04:00  djabbour: and I didn't extract anything
04:00 +Berzerker: I used the wrong words
04:00 +Berzerker: but you did what I was thinking
04:01  djabbour: I think you were suggesting somehow dumping the content of the installer pakcages to manually run their scripts/etc
04:01  djabbour: Which was much more complicated than I actually did.
04:01  djabbour: But perhaps I misunderstood you
04:01 +Berzerker: yes you misunderstood me
04:01 +Berzerker: but that was my fault

04:51  Kasm279: might*
04:51  Kasm279: yes FriedBob
04:51  Kasm279: i forget if xcode is on the Tiger DVD or not
04:51  FriedBob: I only got a single disc
04:51  Tsavo: You're right
04:51  Kasm279: i know its on disc four of the CD set
04:51  Tsavo: if you bought a computer with tiger ti comes with 2 dvds and the second has extras like xcode and such
04:51  Tsavo: it*
04:51  FriedBob: I bought mine w/ 10.3, then bought 10.4 later
04:52  Kasm279: the second is apps :)

05:52  AnthonyCat: My mac keeps asking for my ssh key's (id_rsa) passphrase. It used to be automatic, now it asks me every single time. How can I tell it to remember it?
05:54 --- seraphB0o is now known as evilb0o
05:56  Norrin: AnthonyCat: create a key that doesn't have a passphrase
05:56  AnthonyCat: Norrin: is that insecure?
05:56  Norrin: its less secure.
05:56  AnthonyCat: I guess I will have to, if I can't find a way for it to remember it again
05:56  Norrin: i wasn't aware a mac could remember the key to a ssh passphrase
05:57  Norrin: but, assuming it can, it must be part of .ssh/config - or whatever the ssh config file is
05:57  Norrin: must be able to add it in there somewhere
06:22  q_a_z_steve1: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=121977 Can anyone help me translate these instructions to Snow Leopard?
06:24  S_SubZero: did Leopard and Snow Leopard change enough to make these directions invalid?
06:24 --- q_a_z_steve1 is now known as q_a_z_steve
06:25  q_a_z_steve: Well I'm just having a bit of trouble finding the "System" area that has buttons like Advanced. I have this phone plugged in via USB and I see 0 modems.
06:26  q_a_z_steve: by the way I'm NOT doing hackintosh, MBP and proud of it!
06:29  S_SubZero: my Droid Incredible wont do any of that
06:29  q_a_z_steve: Sorry to hear that.
06:30  q_a_z_steve: Correct me if I
06:30  q_a_z_steve: am wrong but are we not supposed to be looking for buttons in "System Profiler"?
06:30  q_a_z_steve: > Modems
06:30  S_SubZero: it would likely be in the system preferences pane
06:31  S_SubZero: tho system profiler would also have something about the modem I presume
06:31  q_a_z_steve: There is no "Modems" There's Network... And in there I have a connection called 6 to 4, would it be something like that???
06:31  S_SubZero: that's an ipv6 thing
06:31  q_a_z_steve: k, that explains that. So everyone has that, as well as the VPN and PPPoe, got it.
06:32  S_SubZero: i am not sure where my statement indicated that "everyone has that"
06:32  q_a_z_steve: Well I mean to say they are default.
06:32  S_SubZero: I dont have it.
06:33  q_a_z_steve: which, 6 to 4 or the two others?
06:33  LSD`: USB tethering with my Samsung (forget the model number, I don't even know where it is now since I stopped using it not long after I got an iPhone) was mostly plug and play under SL. There was a slight problem in that the system would take a short while to recognise it had been replugged, but I can't tell you if that's been resolved since as I said, I haven't had any need to use it in ages
06:33  S_SubZero: my router isn't giving out ipv6 addresses tho so that makes sense
06:35  q_a_z_steve: This guide I linked also mentions PC Studio, I have no idea where to set that. O
06:35  q_a_z_steve: I've heard it from www.samsung.com, and have downloaded the PC installer, but obviously that won't help as much as I think they should.
07:07  q_a_z_steve1: Thought I could maybe just use bluetooth, that didn't connect. :(
07:09  q_a_z_steve1: Where do I go to get back to Serial devices/connections, I had it up because I was in the Assistant I thought...
07:10  alexbobP: does anybody know how to fix a guid partition table after switching to a larger hard drive?
07:11  alexbobP: mac os x's partition manager sees that there's more space, but bugs out if I try to create partition sin it

09:21 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 97 seconds
09:25  alexbobP: alexlea: if I tell it to make a partition using all the remaining space, it only makes a partition that's 32k... I'm assuming that size is limited by what the partition table says the drive's size is
09:25  alexbobP: richardcavell is gone I guess, but in response to what he said, I did indeed clone a drive...
09:25  alexbobP: I cloned it to a bigger hard drive
09:25  alexlea: alexbobP: does disk utility show the free space
09:26  alexbobP: alexlea: yes, it makes it look like I have all the free space I should have, based on the size of my new hard drive
09:27  alexbobP: and only screws up when I try to actually *use* that space
09:27 --- WormDude is now known as WormFood
09:27  alexlea: is it grouped with hte startup drive? ie how many partitions does disk utility show
09:27  alexbobP: three partitions
09:27  alexbobP: the one with refit, mac os x, and windows
09:28  alexbobP: and it shows 40GB of free space, since I cloned a 60GB ssd to a 100GB hard drive
09:28  alexlea: can you screenshot your disk utility?
09:29  alexbobP: sure, gimme a few minutes
09:29  alexlea: ok
09:30  alexlea: i'm a visual person, so it will help me understand better...as long as i dont get knocked off, i should be able to help
09:31  alexlea: also, open up the partition tool that comes with refit, i wanna see the start and end numbers of the partition table
09:36  alexbobP: http://imgur.com/FmkkM
09:36  alexbobP: http://imgur.com/9YR9R
09:36  alexbobP: alexlea: ^
09:37  alexbobP: that's before and after hitting "apply"
09:37  alexlea: , looking
09:37  alexbobP: when I try refit's partition tool, all it does is say that the main and backup partition tables match, and exit
09:37  jsoft: :)
09:37  alexlea: k, this isnt a gpt thing... you have empty free space before attempting the partition, right?
09:37  alexlea: or no?
09:43  alexbobP: yes
09:43  alexbobP: in the first picture, that last partition is the new partition I'm telling it to create...
09:44  alexbobP: I'm pretty sure it's screwing up because originally I had all the partitions taking up all the space on a 60gb ssd
09:44  alexbobP: and I dd'd it to a 100gb hard drive
09:45  alexlea: have you tried formatting it as fat or any other things?
09:46  alexbobP: yeah, I tried fat and also mac's filesystem
09:47  alexlea: maybe it is the table...i am rusty at this...um, with refit, i meant the partition analyser that it installs into hte utilities folder
09:47  alexlea: it will tell you the start and end blocks of everything
09:48  alexbobP: okay, I ran that
09:48  alexbobP: should I pastebin the output>??
09:48  alexlea: yes please
09:49  alexbobP: http://pastebin.com/T2ScGaGV
09:53  alexlea: ok, um it thinks its only 1799, we need to find the "real" last block
09:53  alexlea: and then edit the end block of that parition, and then resync mbr afterwards
09:53  alexbobP: I don't know how to do that...
09:54  alexlea: there are a few wyas...my issue is i am not sure how we fin the real value
09:55  alexbobP: well mac os x clearly knows it!  it shows the full disk in disk utility
09:56  alexlea: um, ok, go to disk utility and right click the very top of your drive, the part that says 100.03 GB hitachi, then  information...it should say he size
09:56  alexlea: ie mine says 20,072,933,376
09:57  alexlea: 320,072,933,376 *
09:57  alexlea: actually nevermind, not the same format as what we need
09:59  alexlea: alexbobP: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php  you used dd, so maybe you can figure this out
10:01  alexlea: alexbobP: print out what you pastebinned, and before commiting any gparted changes, make sure all the partitions match except that 4th messed up one
10:02  alexlea: this is prolly gonna be the easiest way to fix
10:02  Pyista42: ummm
10:02  Pyista42: so
10:02  Pyista42: a 13 inch macbook white unibody 2010 can't do HD?
10:02  Pyista42: I thought that 320M would be able to do it? even 480P stutters? disappointing 
10:03  LSD`: what codec?
10:03  Pyista42: youtube i dunno
10:04  LSD`: lol, there's your problem. Install click2flash for Safari and see if that helps :P
10:04  Pyista42: some 720 p videos are smooth 
10:04  Pyista42: yea i did 
10:04  Pyista42: I think that might have what caused it heh 
10:04  Pyista42: i duno
10:04  Pyista42: wow sucks 
10:04  Pyista42: a 2010 999$ can't do HD 
10:04  Pyista42: big issue 
10:04  LSD`: (click2flash will force Safari to bypass the flash version of a video and grab a H.264 version which should play better)
10:07  alexbobP: alexlea: gparted livecd?  I already have parted magic, which is almost the same thing...
10:07  alexlea: ok, i am sure that will work then
10:07  alexbobP: alexlea: I've tried creating the partition with that, and gparted errors as well :(
10:08  alexbobP: I think I need to fix the partition table before I can do anything else
10:08  alexlea: ok, maybe fdisk will work...one second
10:10  alexlea: alexbobP: open a terminal and type sudo fdisk /dev/rdisk0 
10:10  alexlea: alexbobP: this will show your partitions, curious if it reports partition 4 as super small too
10:12  Pyista42: LSD`: i mean wow heh
10:12  Pyista42: a 320M can't do native 720P?
10:12  Pyista42: thats bull
10:14  alexbobP: alexlea: it does.  reports the size as 1800.
10:15  alexlea: alexbobP: in the end, would you prefer the second osx partition be connected to teh first one, if so might be better to just start over?
10:16  alexbobP: alexlea: if by 'start over' you mean install a new os from scratch, no, that would be too much of a pain...
10:16  alexlea: and only dd the windows partition; like set up the partitions, then use something like ccc to clone the old mac partition to hte new one, then dd he windows partition over
10:16  alexbobP: I do intend to move the windows partition over and expand it a bit, and expand the os x partition into the new space
10:16  alexbobP: I'm just creating a new partition as a demo of how this doesn't work
10:17  alexlea: i'm not sure you can move a windows partition, well,not eaily anyway
10:17  alexbobP: gparted can do it...
10:17  alexlea: ok
10:17  alexbobP: linux has full ntfs support these days anyways
10:18  alexlea: i have had to redo the partition tab;e before, and i did it in single user mode and had to manually put in starting and ending blocjs
10:19  alexlea: it worked
10:19  Necrosan: man
10:19  Necrosan: I hate partitions
10:19  alexlea: the only problem is i dont know how big your 4th one is supposed to be or how to find out, since everything is reporting it wrong
10:20  alexbobP: well it's not that things are reporting the 4th partition wrong
10:20  alexbobP: it is indeed a tiny partition...
10:21  alexbobP: the problem is that I *can't* create a *non* tiny partition in that space
10:22  alexlea: alexbobP: when you did fdisk..., how big did it say your disk is
10:22  alexlea: should have something liek geometry: 38913/255/63 [625142448 sectors] 
10:23  alexlea: my partition size (i only have one) is one less than that number, ie 625142447
10:23  Necrosan: I am stoked for Dungeon Defenders
10:23  Necrosan: for my evo
10:23  Necrosan: Totally freakin stoked.
10:23  alexlea: are you stoked?
10:29  alexlea: i have to go
10:29  alexlea: alexbobP: fdisk might be the way to go...but i coudnt find instructions...i used it when i deleted my efi partition from the partition tab;e once after a botched freebsd installation
10:30  evilb0o: oh cya alexlea then ;)
10:30  alexbobP: heh
10:30  alexbobP: well I'll try fdisk and see if I can do anything with it...

11:36  soahccc: Hmmm there is no period I think... Maybe up to five times a month but my Mac is under heavy usage :)
11:37  Kasm279|Away: anyway
11:37  Kasm279|Away: night, music haters
11:38 @LaraX: crilly: somehow I was able to +v rorx without ChanServ -v but not EdLin. do you know why?
11:40  crilly|: LaraX, OK I can't get back in the OPs, but anyway, bans
11:40  soahccc: But since 10.6.5 I have another network related problem see here (http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2680956&tstart=0)... But I don't think that there is a relation
11:40 @LaraX: I can invite you

12:15  abstrusenick: is there any mac os app that can send email after each restart?
12:29  Psixerces: abstrusenick: Setup an Automator Workflow or Applescript that sends an eMail, and throw it into your start up items.
13:19  bzinger: anyone using chrome browser?
13:24  topriddy: hello
13:25  topriddy: please i need an urgent help, i got an hp scanjet 2400 connected to my mac, and i dont know how i can scan pictures into it - or the right softwares to use. Its only gimp that porvides and hint to the scanner, i dont see any source to select though
13:25  topriddy: any insights to my problem please
13:28  Psixerces: Go to the HP Website and download the drivers and scanning application
13:28  dnordstrom: bzinger: Aren't we all?
13:28  topriddy: ?
13:29  dnordstrom: bzinger: Using the dev version. Because I'm a developer. "ha ha"
13:29  topriddy: when i do have the drivers what app do i need to scan the documents?
13:29  bzinger: dnordstrom: nice, I just wondering how can i get rss feed from chrome 
13:29  bzinger: it doesn't seems to detect any rss feed link within a page 
13:30  topriddy: btw...i havent needed to install anything for printers to work in the past on any *nix, and i assumed same should apply for scanners
13:30  dnordstrom: bzinger: Check this out: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd
13:31  dnordstrom: Does what every other browser does by default
13:32  bzinger: looks good, yeah it does what other browser does by default, but doesn't come with it by default :) 
13:32  snL20: topriddy: that's strange cause i've always had to install extra software for it
13:32  dnordstrom: bzinger: Yeah. Safari has that little RSS icon, Opera probably has it but Chrome, nope. Confused me.
13:32  blue_sky: does anyone know the actual model of network interface on currently shipping Mac Minis? I believe it's a broadcom, but I'd like to know which. 
13:32  topriddy: have never needed to install anything to make printer work...
13:33  topriddy: http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodNameId=297431&prodTypeId=15179&prodSeriesId=297429&swLang=8&taskId=135&swEnvOID=219
13:33  dnordstrom: I've never had to install extra software either
13:33  dnordstrom: I think
13:34  topriddy: in fact i brag amongst my windows users that i dont need lotta drivers to make devices work...maybe that should be more suited for Linux and not Mac OS X
13:34  snL20: though i've never bothered using all included *nixs
13:34  bzinger: dnordstrom: its very confusing, vimium is amazing plugin 
13:34  dnordstrom: vimium looks cool
13:35  bzinger: very productive tool 
13:35  dnordstrom: Man, that is PERFECT for using with Dragon Dictate
13:35  topriddy: well so the consensus is that a driver is needed to be explicitly installed on os x to get any scanning done
13:36  snL20: i've always had to install cups on linux =)
13:36  dnordstrom: bzinger: Was playing around with Dragon Dictate the other day and ot works great, but no simple way of browsing. Have to click by hand. Vimium will be great!
13:37  dnordstrom: Take an extension for keyboard browsing, and make it into speech browsing :P
13:37  dnordstrom: Will be fun for a couple of days until I'm tired of it, but worth it
13:37  bzinger: dnordstrom: that will be amazing, I never use Dragon Dicate before, but sounds pretty good idea 
13:39  dnordstrom: I've used these speech programs before, I think I'll use the new Dictate 2.0 for emails sometimes and similar stuff, but will be a fun experiment to try it out for browsing and navigating
13:39  dnordstrom: Recognition is really really goot actually
13:39  dnordstrom: good*
13:40  dnordstrom: Just too bad there a bug that reverts the two last letters all the time...
13:40  topriddy: still i ask - is there any COOL free game one could play on the MAC?
13:41  Tsavo: Sauerbraten
13:41  dnordstrom: topriddy: What kinda games are you into?
13:41  snL20: topriddy: free ?
13:41  bzinger: free first person shooter, rpg etc
13:41  Tsavo: Sauerbraten!
13:41  topriddy: strategy, board games, Mario*, okay lets start from inexpensive...
13:42  topriddy: I dont have any game i would want to play here - games that would interest a programmer. I love Chess - but please dont suggest that
13:42  snL20: topriddy: broken sword directors cut is available on steam for 5 euro
13:43  bzinger: WoW?
13:43  dnordstrom: topriddy: Then I don't know much, sorry. There are some neat FPS I think. I'm not a gamer though
13:43  bzinger: eve-online
13:43  Tsavo: Sauerbraten is open source and you can build your own maps right in the game
13:43  topriddy: am downloading the HP driver now and its about 113MB...about if i dont have internet
13:44  dnordstrom: bzinger: I am writing this just with my speech recognition softwaer
13:44  dnordstrom: See, last two letters ;)
13:46  bzinger: dnordstrom: why does it do that?
13:46  snL20: bzinger: nobodys perfect ?
13:46  snL20: heh
13:46  dnordstrom: bzinger: Just a bug I think
13:46  bzinger: did you alter the dictionary or something, that seems trivial mistake
13:46  dnordstrom: Pretty big bug though
13:47  dnordstrom: I heard more people experiences it
13:47  bzinger: i never use it before, but its just sounds there something wrong with the built-in dictionary
13:47  dnordstrom: http://www.macspeech.com/extensions/forums/topic.php?id=1006
13:48  bzinger: maybe is caused by the way you say "er" in "ware" 
13:48  dnordstrom: Maybe if I disable TextExpander while using it, like someone said in the forum
13:48  snL20: dnordstrom: thats pretty good for speech recog software though... personally I would never trust that type of software for anything though
13:49  dnordstrom: snL20: You should try it, it's really good
13:49  dnordstrom: http://arstechnica.com/software/reviews/2010/12/dragon-dictate-20-for-mac-the-ars-review.ars
13:49  dnordstrom: I Read that and just had to try it :)
13:49  dnordstrom: *read
13:50  dnordstrom: But I think now that I actually read the whole forum thread that it may be textexander messing up the two last letters, because I use that one quite a lot, always enabled
13:50  bzinger: can you do stuff like " open terminal, execute top, tell me the load average" :) 
13:52  snL20: bzinger: rob the bank and bring me the loot ;)
13:52  dnordstrom: bzinger: You can do "access Terminal" to open terminal, then you can make your own AppleScripts, shell script, text macros, Automator stuff etc
13:53  dnordstrom: So yeah, I'd say you can
13:54  dnordstrom: I think I'm gonna do some shell script to git commit, push and cap deploy stuff when I'm working, would be nice
13:54  bzinger: cool, once you get that, you can pipe output to the "say" command to read outputs of you scripts/
13:54  dnordstrom: Hah, nice idea
13:55  snL20: dnordstrom: you just have to watch what you say around the computer heh :D
13:55  dnordstrom: lol
13:55  dnordstrom: Yeah
13:55  bzinger: how about make me a burger
13:55  dnordstrom: :P
13:56  snL20: get in the kitchen and make me some pie!
13:56  bzinger: dnordstrom: when you using it, does it open stuff in the foreground(doesn't change your focus window)?
13:57  dnordstrom: Hmm can you give an example?
13:58  bzinger: like tell the recognition program to execute scripts in terminal, while you typing email in browser, does the terminal get open and get focused, so you can't focus on your browser and typing your email 
14:00  dnordstrom: Never tried actually, I've always just opened the terminal and used text macros for now, haven't tried applescript execution. Would be interesting to know
14:01  bzinger: will be amazing, if you can tell the computer to execute some task, while you doing other stuff using your keyboard(true multitasking :) 
14:02  snL20: bring home the bacon
14:02  snL20: :D
14:03  bzinger: yeah, will be nice to if you in the middle of typing something, and tell the computer to open up documentation on the second monitor 
14:04  dnordstrom: Oooh yeah, so nice :)
14:05  snL20: baking bacon with macon
14:06  bzinger: you can actually do it, just buy a arduino and hook it up to your grill/toaster, then send command to it via speech recognition 
14:08  snL20: I have south park on dvd and in the first season maybe more seasons I dont remember they show a pig named macon wich they feed bacon
15:50  blue_sky: does anyone know the actual model of network interface on currently shipping Mac Minis? I believe it's a broadcom, but I'd like to know which. 
15:51  zer0her0: oh ifixit has an API
15:52  FriedBob: zer0her0: oi oi!
15:53  zer0her0: oi oi
15:53  zer0her0: blue_sky: according to http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac-Mini-Model-A1347-Teardown/3094/3
15:53  zer0her0: Broadcom BCM57765 integrated gigabit ethernet and memory card reader controller
15:54  blue_sky: zer0her0: Sorry, I didn't know your comment was directed at me, I'm not familiar with ifixit, but I think I will be soon! THanks
15:54  FriedBob: zer0her0: I had my first full shift as a licensed forklift operator yesterday. that was fun.
15:55  zer0her0: blue_sky: oh i was just making comment they have an API now
15:55  fujisan: FriedBob forklift is also a ftp/filemanager for OS X :)
15:55  zer0her0: in researching the topic :)
15:56  zer0her0: FriedBob: oh gawd, so glad i don't live near you ;)
15:56  codeshepherd: i ran "sudo port uninstall inactive" and it says  --- Unable to uninstall render 0.9_1, the following ports depend on it: xrender cairo gtk2 ... how do i fix this issue?
15:56  FriedBob: zer0her0: I am a good forklift driver. Just stay clear when I am on the order selector / joe...
15:57  FriedBob: codeshepherd: Get rid of xrender, cairo and GTK2 and anything that depends on them... or just ignore it.
15:58  fujisan: guys what will gain more performance a ram upgrade or an upgrade to a SSD ?
15:58  FriedBob: fujisan: RAM
15:58  fujisan: so ram makes OS X faster?
15:58  FriedBob: Depends on how much the base ram is, but you will almost always be able to notice a difference.
15:59  FriedBob: How much is in there right now?
15:59  fujisan:  gb
15:59  zer0her0: fujisan: yea RAM
15:59  fujisan: 4*
16:00  fujisan: 2x4 gb
16:00  fujisan: is what i am considering
16:00  FriedBob: Of that 4 gig, how much is in use at any given point in time?
16:00  fujisan: almost all of it
16:00  FriedBob: Then yeah.
16:01  FriedBob: BRB, need to walk my dog
16:01  fujisan: ok :)
16:07  FriedBob: Back

23:02  alexlea: i rarely use it...i prefer pixelmator...but ps cs5 works fine on my 13 inch mb
23:02  crilly: I bought Pixelmator too, but until it gets a path tool and the ability to kernel fonts, its use for me is limited.
23:03  FriedBob: On 10.4, where would I set the 'workgroup' name for SMB/ windows shares?
23:04  zer0her0: hell yea fellow pixelmator users
23:05  zer0her0: pixelmator @ home, & CS5 @ work.

23:41  FriedBob: Guess I will just keep my mouth shut next time. :)
23:44  pgpkeys: anyone know the DL standard? DVDR +R DL? or DVDR -R DL?
23:44  crilly: pgpkeys, hi
23:45  FriedBob: I'm sure that SOMEONE does... but I do not.
23:46  pgpkeys: know what the OS X Installation DVD is written on? +R DL or -R DL?
23:47  FriedBob: All I know is the DL part.
23:48  pgpkeys: hrmm looks like DVD-R DL uses 8,543,666,176 bytes and DVD+R DL uses 8,547,991,552 bytes. not sure if thats dignificant or not :shrug:
23:50  pgpkeys: hrmm, at this stage not sure if it really matters
23:52  Angostura: Apple was historically the big proponent of -R
23:54  crilly: Anyone good with iMovie? How do I slow down a transition in a template when the video clip is only 18 seconds? It's going a lot quicker than the video.
