00:08  alexlea: LordDragon: now i will forver wonder if *that* was the issue
00:08  alexlea: :(
00:08  LordDragon: alexlea, in fact i had them ship me a replacement power brick cuz i thought it was defective. well i dont know if the g4's had the same issue. mine is a g3
00:08  alexlea: LordDragon: i am referring to an intel macbook core 2 duo
00:08  alexlea: LordDragon: the powerbook i had worked fine
00:09 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 99 seconds
00:10  alexlea: LordDragon: did you ever get the apple tv
00:11  LordDragon: alexlea, i doubt the new macbooks suffer from that battery issue. and yes i got the 99 dollar appletv few months ago. its cute and tiny
00:12  alexlea: it looks cute, i am reading ipad rumors, and there was a big pic of one...
00:12  alexlea: i think i need to get an ipad
00:12  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah sources at foxconn are predicting new ipads around februrary
00:13  LordDragon: alexlea, i thought you didnt want an ipad or ipod anymore
00:13  alexlea: LordDragon: ideally i want a macbook pro, but i have been wanting one for years...its never in my price range...ipad is
00:14  alexlea: 500 is alot easier to come up with than 1200
00:14  LordDragon: alexlea, would you really use the ipad alot though?
00:14  LordDragon: i mean dont get me wrong
00:14  LordDragon: i want one too
00:14  LordDragon: but i stopped myself
00:14  LordDragon: cuz in reality
00:14  LordDragon: id use it for a few weeks
00:14  LordDragon: and then it would just sit here
00:14  alexlea: LordDragon: i would need an external kb and the camera connector kit(and hook up a hd instead)
00:15  alexlea: right now, all i am doing is surfing and irc-ing
00:15  alexlea: thats usually all i do
00:15  LordDragon: alexlea, i doubt the ipads will ever allow you to hookup a HD
00:15  alexlea: LordDragon: it can already be done
00:15  alexlea: LordDragon: theres a hack
00:15  LordDragon: alexlea, oh. well i know u could do some things with the camera adapter, however the latest firmware disables that
00:16  alexlea: LordDragon: just a matter of time before you can do it again
00:16  LordDragon: alexlea, well im sure if you jailbreak, u could hack it somehow
00:16  alexlea: yeah i always find ways to do what i want
00:17  alexlea: LordDragon: getting an externl kb is the most important thing though... with taht, the ipad is very useful
00:18  LordDragon: alexlea, if the ipad gets a high res screen like the iphone/ipod 4, thats gonna be a huge temptation
00:18  alexlea: LordDragon: yeah, i hope that rumor is true
00:19  alexlea: LordDragon: i dont see how it could be, but i still hope
00:19  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah a high res screen thats that big would drive the cost way up. but you never know
00:20  alexlea: things get cheaper....i just saw 8 gugs of ram for 100 bux earlier
00:20  alexlea: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MX5YWI?ie=UTF8&tag=oxd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001MX5YWI
00:20  yazdmich: The built-in Ips is good
00:20  LordDragon: alexlea, 8 gugs of ram? is that like a jug but filled with ram?
00:20  alexlea: ips, thats just so you can see it form a bunch of angles, right?
00:21  alexlea: LordDragon: yup...jug of ram, gug
00:21  alexlea: i want this maybe, if i get an ipad http://clamcase.com/
00:21  LordDragon: wow crucial too. good brand
00:21  alexlea: if they ever actually start selling it, it like vaporware
00:22  LordDragon: interesting. would make it super thick though
00:22  alexlea: i'm not worried about that
00:22  LordDragon: alexlea, im trying to make my xmas list. any ideas for some cool gadget thats around 40 or 50 bucks?
00:23  alexlea: LordDragon: there are no cool gadgets that cheap :(
00:23  alexlea: LordDragon: unless you want a flash drive...lol
00:24  LordDragon: alexlea, hey thats not a bad idea. i could use a good one. all mine are full or formatted to a specific task
00:24  alexlea: i havent gotten anything for christmas in years....
00:25  LordDragon: alexlea, my family usually buys stuff for each other, though this year is gonna be a bit low profile
00:25  alexlea: i have no family like that...where its like this one entity...tehre are osme people i am related to, and sometimes paths cross
00:26  alexlea: when my mom was still alive, there was a "family", and several times a year the mebers of teh "famlily" woudl all magically be in the same palce
00:26  LordDragon: alexlea, ah. yeah i am very blessed that i am so close to my family
00:27  alexlea: LordDragon: well, it would be all the members....its not like teh rest of my family is meeting in secret without me
00:27  ae86-drifter: k
00:28  alexlea: well, some are.... my little brother has a 'family", my ex stepfather, then his siblings, and parents, and his wives siblings and parents....
00:28  LordDragon: ah thats nice
00:28  LordDragon: alexlea, did your brother get a xmas tree?
00:28  alexlea: LordDragon: my little brother left
00:29  alexlea: LordDragon: he went "home" for a month
00:29  LordDragon: alexlea, i thought he was living at "home" ?
00:29  alexlea: LordDragon: no, phoenix is where he is staying while in school...Tennessee is home
00:29  LordDragon: alexlea, ahh. and he didnt invite you to join him? :(
00:30  alexlea: LordDragon: i could have gone if i wanted, but it wasnt a realistic possibility
00:30  LordDragon: ah ok. well hes letting you still stay at the apartment right?
00:31  alexlea: LordDragon: yeah, he left like a week ago...and its not a matter of "letting" i mean, we're paying rent
00:31  alexlea: we live there/here now
00:33  LordDragon: alexlea, ah ok good
00:34  LordDragon: you should get a little xmas tree
00:34  LordDragon: thats what i do
00:34  LordDragon: for my bedroom
00:34  alexlea: LordDragon: i got a string of peppermint lights, tahts as far as i am going
00:34  LordDragon: like a 2 foot thingie
00:34  LordDragon: hehe ok
00:35  LordDragon: wow nice: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS_Jailbreak
00:35  alexlea: i had a mini tree last year
00:35  alexlea: we plugged it into the power unverterin hte bronco
00:35  LordDragon: apparently the ps3 can now be jailbroken
00:35  alexlea: inverter*
00:35  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah thats nice. why not this year?
00:35  b3ny0-: people still care about the PS3?
00:36  LordDragon: b3ny0-, ps3 > 360 > wii
00:37  alexlea: LordDragon: because i got peppermint lights; i am trying to find a ic so i can show you
00:37  RenegadeWut: LordDragon: Life > ps3 > 360 > wii
00:37  LordDragon: alexlea, okie
00:37  b0o-yeah: 360 > ps3 OR Wii
00:38  RenegadeWut: :-/
00:38  alexlea: LordDragon: a big part of it is the weather. its 77 degrees ehre
00:38  b3ny0-: computer > all
00:38  alexlea: LordDragon: it doesnt feel like christmas
00:38  b0o-yeah: b3ny0-: yeah for most things
00:39  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah. it reminds me of my dad in louisiana. often he celebrates xmas sitting on the porch in tshirt and shorts
00:39  b3ny0-: console might have it on fighting and racing games, but that's not enough to deal me in 
00:41 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
00:42 * b0o-yeah has console so he doesn't have to run windows
00:44  LordDragon: i just did a search for "console flow chart"
00:45  LordDragon: got an image result, saw the chart. clicked on it, and a huge picture of a penis penetrating a vagina appears on my browser
00:45  LordDragon: im still trying to figure out how what i searched for is in any way related to vaginal sex
00:45  b0o-yeah: lol extra bonus? 
00:46  LordDragon: b0o-yeah, lol i guess so
00:46  b3ny0-: there are good games on mac osx now :P

01:33  stones: Hey guys, I lost my re-install DVD
01:33  S_SubZero: oh noes
01:33  stones: I cant remember what OS I had on this, when I boot up I just see a blinking question mark.
01:33  stones: How can I figure out what OS I need?
01:34  S_SubZero: well first we may want to define what it is
01:35  stones: All I know its a 24" all in one
01:35  stones: (This is my first MAC, purchased for a recording studio)
01:36  S_SubZero: Apple brands the all-in-ones with the "iMac" moniker.
01:36  stones: ah yes
01:36  stones: iMAC 24" I guess then?
01:37  S_SubZero: I recommend you buy Snow Leopard.  It's what, $29 or so.  It's available at any good computer store.
01:38 @ChrisAM: stones ... Call apple with your serial number... for about $20, they'll send you new discs.
01:39  stones: Is that 10.5?
01:39  stones: And the serial number is missing 3 digits :/
01:39  stones: I had bought the floor model, and they didnt include the CDs
01:40 @ChrisAM: from the apple store?
01:40  stones: I tried reaching them, but this was almost a year ago.
01:40  stones: No, Sam ash
01:40  stones: They sell music equipment
01:40 @ChrisAM: try apple... they might be able to work with you.
01:40  S_SubZero: "I lost my disc"  "the serial# is scratched"  "they didn't include the discs"   "I dont know the name of this thing I paid thousands for."
01:41 @ChrisAM: The advantage of getting the discs from Apple vs the $29 retail Snow Leopard is that the replacements will have iLife and iWork.
01:43 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
01:45  stones: Ok
01:45  stones: and theres no way to fix this blinking question mark without the cd?
01:45  stones: Subzero, I know how it sounds.. trust me
01:46  stones: I thought about it before I called apple, however I spoke to Sam ash, Im working to try and get the serial # from them.
01:46  stones: Its a pitty they put the serial # on a sticker, I am missing the first 3 digits or so, he couldn't get it with the 8 or 9 digits I can see though.

02:58  kevin|droid: Hello
02:58  kevin|droid: I'm having trouble getting my macbook to work
02:59  MrUnagi: turn it on
02:59  kevin|droid: When I boot it up it seems to work fine until the point where it should show me my desktop
02:59  MrUnagi: then what does it do
03:00  CPng|N: not show the desktop
03:00  kevin|droid: Then the screen goes black and the light at the front right blinks slowly
03:00  kevin|droid: As if it was closed
03:00  MrUnagi: it goes to sleep
03:00  CPng|N: it goes directly into sleep. interesting
03:00  CPng|N: maybe it's tired
03:00  kevin|droid: :|
03:00  CPng|N: perhaps the battery is shot
03:00  kevin|droid: Its plugged in
03:00  CPng|N: doesn't necessarily matter
03:00  kevin|droid: Should I try booting without the battery
03:00  CPng|N: how old is the battery
03:01  CPng|N: yeah try that
03:01  CPng|N: I forget if they'll run plugged in but with no battery
03:01  kevin|droid: Late 08 same as the macbook
03:02  kevin|droid: I think the magnet that determines if its closed or not is shot
03:02  CPng|N: oldish for a battery but not extremely old. unless you had the same sh!tty battery I had
03:02  CPng|N: ah, interesting theory
03:02  kevin|droid: It has been going in and out of sleep mode for no reason recently
03:03  kevin|droid: But I had insomniax set to come on at boot up and it had been working perfectly
03:03  kevin|droid: Its never done this before
03:03  kevin|droid: Yeah the same thing happens without the battery
03:06  kevin|droid: So I'm without a working computer at the moment... 
03:06 @ChrisAM: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1579794
03:07  kevin|droid: Is there a way to boot it up in a mode that won't go to sleep when its closed so I can make sure insomniax is still set to boot
03:07 @ChrisAM: "Just fixed this problem by disconnecting the battery and power supply, then holding down the power button for a solid 7 seconds. "
03:07 @ChrisAM: I don't know why that would work
03:09  kevin|droid: Ill try it right now
03:10  kevin|droid: Nope
03:10  CPng|N: hmm
03:10  kevin|droid: Didn't work
03:10  CPng|N: well there is a way to get onto the system in "single user" mode. but what you do then... I don't know
03:10  CPng|N: google like mad
03:11  kevin|droid: I don't have an external display that'll work either
03:11  MrUnagi: reformat
03:11  MrUnagi: reinstall
03:11  kevin|droid: How do I get in
03:11  CPng|N: that's a lazy man's windows solution
03:11  MrUnagi: sure is =)
03:11  CPng|N: I think hold s or cmd-s
03:11  MrUnagi: works every time lol
03:11  kevin|droid: MrUnagi: I've done that since this has been happening
03:11  MrUnagi: then its hardware
03:12  kevin|droid: Didn't affect it
03:12  CPng|N: that'll get you to the command line interface. might be able to read the logs from there
03:12  MrUnagi: CPng|N: in the apple world its zap pram, repair permissions, repair disk, reformat reinstall
03:12  CPng|N: yeah
03:12  MrUnagi: :D
03:12  CPng|N: I don't think the magnets affect the sleep mode. I think that's in the hinge. 
03:13  CPng|N: but, if they do, maybe try putting a fridge maget near the front
03:13  MrUnagi: but yea, reformatting is a good barometer for if it is software or hardware
03:13  kevin|droid: I have a magnet
03:13  CPng|N: but that could be dangerous if you go waving it over the HDD
03:13  MrUnagi: 'dangerous'
03:13  CPng|N: oh wait, you did a format, not just a reinstall?
03:13  kevin|droid: Yeah
03:13  MrUnagi: doesn't permanently harm the disk
03:14  kevin|droid: Had hdd problems a while ago
03:14  CPng|N: a reinstall would possibly keep your old f'd up settings. a fresh format... yeah, now yer screwed :(
03:14  MrUnagi: see...hardware
03:14  CPng|N: yar
03:14  CPng|N: that sucks
03:14  MrUnagi: :D
03:14  CPng|N: applecare FTW!
03:14  kevin|droid: I've had a lot of pproblems with this macbook
03:14  MrUnagi: kevin|droid: ill buy it from you
03:14  kevin|droid: No applecare
03:15  CPng|N: well if you aren't so burned that you won't buy another, get applecare next time. can save you an ass load of cash after 3 years
03:15  kevin|droid: How much would you pay? Its an aliminum macbook, 2.4ghz, 2gb ram
03:15  kevin|droid: 13"
03:15  kevin|droid: I'm getting another brand as my next computer
03:15  kevin|droid: I decided that a while ago
03:16  CPng|N: my wife is using my 2008 15" mbp now. for the first time ever she just put all of her contacts into the computer and printed real address labels for xmas cards. yay mac
03:16  CPng|N: heh
03:16  kevin|droid: I don't do stuff like that
03:17  CPng|N: me either. lol
03:17  CPng|N: well. I have my contacts in address book/google/droid
03:17  kevin|droid: I won't have the money for a replacement or repairs for 2 months
03:17  kevin|droid: There has to be a way I can fix it
03:18  kevin|droid: :|
03:18  CPng|N: oh I'm sure there is, but it might be tough finding out how
03:18  CPng|N: for free, at least
03:18  CPng|N: I would still try to boot into single user mode and look at the system logs
03:19  kevin|droid: I can't get in to that mode
03:19  kevin|droid: I've been trying
03:21  CPng|N: wow
03:22  CPng|N: thank * for your droid eh?
03:25  kevin|droid: Yeah
03:26  kevin|droid: I have an old slow ubuntu desktop around somewhere
03:26  kevin|droid: Ill get on that
03:31  Swian: cool, just found out my mac mini shipped and should be here in a couple days
03:31  MrUnagi: kevin|droid: why another brand?
03:35  kevin|ubuntu: so how much would it cost to get apple to fix this
03:35 +Branes: http://blogs.computerworld.com/17521/espionage_act_makes_felons_of_us_all -- Dear Americans: If you are not "authorized" personnel, but you have read, written about, commented upon, tweeted, spread links by "liking" on Facebook, shared by email, or otherwise discussed "classified" information disclosed from WikiLeaks, you could be implicated for crimes under the U.S. Espionage Act.
03:36  MrUnagi: kevin|droid: how much do you want to sell it for
03:37  kevin|droid: MrUnagi: because apple computer cost twice as much for worse specs, and the battery life, slimness, and os x aren't worth $1700 extra to me
03:37  MrUnagi: worse battery life
03:37  MrUnagi: ?
03:37  MrUnagi: oh
03:37  MrUnagi: nvermind
03:37  MrUnagi: cool, how much do u want for that
03:37  Swian: kevin there are no apple authorized service centers near you?
03:39  kevin|droid: Now my desktop doesn't work
03:41  kevin|droid: The only place I know of around here for apple stuff is the apple store in the mall
03:41  Kasm279: Branes: they have no way to enforce that
03:41  Kasm279: literally
03:41  Kasm279: i mean, they could get IPs
03:41  Kasm279: but thats OVER 9000! people
03:43  kevin|droid: There. Is not a functional computer in this house
03:43  Swian: bummer
03:44  kevin|droid: And my schoolwork is on tpmy macbook
03:47  Kasm279: briliant
03:48  Kasm279: JVC could not have possibly just made it so the A/V output also worked with stereo headphones?
03:48  kevin|droid: ?
03:49  Kasm279: my vidoe camera
03:50  osxdude: hmm
03:50  osxdude: there may be an option in the setup menu
03:50  osxdude: on some Canons there are
03:52  Kasm279: ugh
03:52  Kasm279: smurfing clarinets can't smurfing play anything right
03:53  kevin|ubuntu: ...
03:55  Kasm279: interesting
03:56  kevin|ubuntu: the hdd in a macbook would work with another laptop right
03:56  Kasm279: this old apple female RCA to male 3.2mmTRS adaptor has something in it
03:56  Kasm279: because changing volume on the cam doesn't chance the vol in the output
03:57  Kasm279: nvm
03:57  Kasm279: its the cam
03:59  MrUnagi: kevin|ubuntu: you gonna sell it to me?
03:59  kevin|ubuntu: uh, how much would you be willing to pay for it
04:00  MrUnagi: how much do you want for it
04:00  kevin|ubuntu: well I paid $1600 for it 2 years ago
04:00  kevin|ubuntu: so maybe $400 or $500
04:00  MrUnagi: so then it's worth about 300
04:00  kevin|ubuntu: :|
04:01  MrUnagi: a non working 2 year old mbp?
04:01  kevin|ubuntu: the same thing new from apple is $1200, but with 4gb instead of 2gb ram
04:01  MrUnagi: is it a mbp or mb
04:01  kevin|ubuntu: it's aluminum unibody but I think it's a macbook
04:02  kevin|ubuntu: I'm not sure I want to sell it though, might still try to fix it
04:02  MrUnagi: only way you would get more than 300 or 400 is if it had a wrranty
04:04  MrUnagi: for example, ebay, 44 minutes left on a macbook with 1gb ram 2.16ghz and 120gb hd at $296
04:06  richardcavell: not worth it
04:07  kevin|ubuntu: mine's 2.4ghz 2gb ram 250gb
04:09  MrUnagi: worth not much more
04:10  acous: i'd say at least 400
04:10  kevin|ubuntu: there has to be another way to fix it
04:10  acous: what's wrong with it?
04:11  kevin|ubuntu: I think it's whatever senses when it's closed
04:11  kevin|ubuntu: as soon as it gets booted up it goes to sleep mode
04:11  kevin|ubuntu: and I can't get it out
04:11  kevin|ubuntu: of sleep mode
04:11  acous: did you try an external kb/mouse/screen?
04:12  kevin|ubuntu: I know insomniax will fix this but I can't get into it to turn it on
04:12  kevin|ubuntu: all I have is a usb mouse
04:12  acous: :/
04:12  kevin|ubuntu: the keyboard and screen I have don't work because if apple's proprietary crap
04:12  acous: displayport? :)
04:13  acous: it's one with the battery sealed in right
04:13  kevin|ubuntu: no
04:13  kevin|ubuntu: unibody aluminum 
04:13  kevin|ubuntu: same as the current pros
04:15  acous: current pros have non-removable battery i thought
04:16  kevin|ubuntu: no
04:16  kevin|ubuntu: huh
04:17  kevin|ubuntu: I got it to a state where the light isn't flashing
04:17  kevin|ubuntu: it's not in sleep mode
04:17  kevin|ubuntu: but the screen is off
04:17  kevin|ubuntu: and when I press a key it beeps
04:19  CPng|N: in PC land that usually signifies a motherboard failure
04:20  kevin|ubuntu: ...
04:20  kevin|ubuntu: I bet that's an expensive repair...
04:20  acous: apple don't use motherboards, they use the vastly superior yet functionally identical logic board
04:20  CPng|N: lol true
04:22  kevin|ubuntu: what can I do to be sure
04:22  acous: does holding the power button not shut it down ?
04:23  kevin|ubuntu: it does
04:23  acous: and when you try to turn it on, it just has a black screen?
04:23  acous: non powered screen
04:23  acous: and beep on keypress?
04:23  kevin|ubuntu: no, it boots up normally until it should be showing me the desktop
04:23  kevin|ubuntu: then it gos to sleep mode
04:24  acous: hmm
04:24  kevin|ubuntu: then if I press the power button it comes out of sleep mode and goes into this mode
04:24  kevin|ubuntu: where it's off screen and beep on keypress
04:24  acous: maybe you can boot into single user mode and somehow get the status of the different sensors
04:25  kevin|ubuntu: I tried but I'm probably not doing it right
04:25  kevin|ubuntu: getting into single user mode that it
04:25  kevin|ubuntu: is*
04:25  acous: hold s on boot isn't it
04:26  kevin|ubuntu: doesn't do it
04:26  kevin|ubuntu: the mode it's in right now
04:26  kevin|ubuntu: when I press the power button the screen flashes whight for a second
04:26  kevin|ubuntu: *white
04:27  kevin|ubuntu: now it doesn't do that anymore
04:27  acous: oh it's hold command and s
04:30  kevin|ubuntu: ok I got into it
04:37  acous: kevin|ubuntu: well at least that's something, you might try safe mode aswell
04:37  acous: kevin|ubuntu: sorry i don't know any commands to get info about the systme
05:18  crankharder: so i've never syncd photos from my iphone to this itunes -- in itunes the option to enable syncing says "Sync photots from <drop down select>" -- which to me imples that it'll copy things from that selected folder to the iphone, possibly overwriting whats on the iphone...  is this the case?

11:12  richardcavell: how do you do that?
11:14  alexlea: ^^ richardcavell

11:16  alexlea: richardcavell: first try an smc reset http://osxdaily.com/2010/03/24/when-and-how-to-reset-your-mac’s-system-management-controller-smc/
11:16  alexlea: http://osxdaily.com/2010/03/24/when-and-how-to-reset-your-mac’s-system-management-controller-smc/
11:16  alexlea: acl, its not posting right
11:16  richardcavell: that's ok I got it
11:17  alexlea: as for calibrating, you charge it all the way, then let it drain all the way until it falls asleep, (ideally at night, so you can sleep while its still dying completely) then plug in and fully charge again
11:17 @crilly|work: richardcavell: Cool! They're there if you need them :)
11:17  alexlea: if after both an smc reset and calibration, it still has issues, then most likeley a bad battery
11:17 @crilly|work: charge it again without turning it on, I might add, alexlea 
11:17  richardcavell: sounds a bit weird.  If I hold the power key down when there's no power to the device, how does that do anything?
11:18 @crilly|work: It will trigger the low level systems to fire up.
11:18  richardcavell: with no power?
11:18  alexlea: power buttons are momentary switches, you are connecting enough to do the smc thing
11:19  joobie: guys anyone experienced slowness with Mac's accessing SBS2008 fileshares? I have this delay when I try to do so from a few macs.. found one solution to use :139 when connecting, though if I want to use :445 - is there a fix for this?
11:20  richardcavell: crilly|work: should I do the drain and recharge thing after SMC reset?
11:20  richardcavell: or before?
11:20  alexlea: crilly|work: it doesnt matter if you use it or keep it off while doing the final charge
11:20  alexlea: richardcavell: do smc first
11:20 @crilly|work: alexlea: It's always recommended you don't use it.
11:21  richardcavell: alright so SMC reset then drain and recharge while turned off
11:21  alexlea: richardcavell: you continue charging the rest of the way, then disharhe then recharge
11:22  richardcavell: huh?
11:22  richardcavell: My battery's currently at 42%.  I've been watching a movie
11:22  alexlea: richardcavell: the process is fully charge, discharge, then fully charge again...
11:23  richardcavell: alexlea: ok will do
11:23  richardcavell: SMC reset, then charge, discharge, recharge, right?
11:23  alexlea: unless your battery is the problem, smc should fix it tho
11:24  alexlea: calibration should be a monthly thing, but most people dont do it
11:24  alexlea: richardcavell: yes
11:24  armin_w: this is a general mac channel right?
11:25  alexlea: and its a matter of preference whether you use it for that final charge or leave it off...crilly says keep it off, i say who cares...so your call
11:27  richardcavell:  does the computer need to be on at any time during the recharge/discharge thing or is it all somewhere inside the computer that doesn't need to be turned on?
11:27  alexlea: yes
11:27  richardcavell: yes to which part
11:28  richardcavell: Alright I'm doing it now
11:28  richardcavell: Talk to you tomorrow I guess
11:29  alexlea: richardcavell: for the disharge, you're supposed to let it shut off on its own, and it goes into hibernate or sleep or something, and then eventually completely dies
11:29  alexlea: richardcavell: the last part, the final recharge, i say it can be on, crilly says its better to be off...i believe apple says it doesnt matter
11:29  alexlea: i have horrible net/lag and have been trying to see what apple says, to confirm
11:35  alexlea: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/9036.html

15:14  exitcode1: zparta: what's your question though? can't hurt to ask here too :)
15:14  zparta: is there any event or something of the sorts that gives me the possibility to do something on wake and sleep?

15:16  zparta: well, i am in a couple of channels where the tension can be well
