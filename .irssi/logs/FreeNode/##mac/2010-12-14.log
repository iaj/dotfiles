12:04  natrium1970: Does anyone know how to get help activating Office 2011? I bought the download version from Digital River. The product key doesn't work. Digital River's help says to contact Microsoft. Microsoft says to call the number that pops up in Setup Assistant (which doesn't pop up anything).
12:13  kateweb: if it dosent work call the 800 number in the documenttation
12:13  kateweb: or better yet ask for a refund
12:14  natrium1970: What documentation?!
12:15  natrium1970: Digital River didn't provide any number, just links to MS site.
12:15  natrium1970: DR's site is http://www.officeformac.com/ (for Office for Mac)
12:16  natrium1970: Oops. Maybe that's a *link*. Ugh. I'm going nuts with all this stuff and having wasted $120.
12:17  kateweb: yeah you did
12:18  kateweb: best buy had it for $99
12:18  kateweb: http://buy.officeformac.com/store/msmacus/DisplayHelpPage
12:21  natrium1970: I should wait until tomorrow before I dael with people. I don't want to say what I think to people right now.
12:28  kateweb: well the faster you get it overwith
12:28  kateweb: but if they gave you a crap key ( witch they shouldent have) then they need to fix it
12:29  kateweb: are you copy pasteing or typeing it in by hand
12:29  natrium1970: kateweb: I've tried both, just in case,
12:29  natrium1970: Many times, I might add
12:30  kateweb: yeah the link i gave you is to the help page
12:30  natrium1970: Apparently, I'm supposed see information on product serial number or such, And i'm supposd to get a popup window with infor on how to contact MS with phoe number

12:33  natrium1970: My current MacBook is probably the same as your "old" one.
12:33  kateweb: also when you get an error i think the box ware you put they key in gives you info on calling ms
12:34  natrium1970: No, there is no info on calling MS there.

12:36  pgpkeys: it is an Intel Core 2 Duo, but not sure if it's using that chipset. (trying to find out if it supports accessing a full 4GB of RAM or not)
