01:09  simplicity-: An SSD for my MBP!
01:09  simplicity-: You?
01:10  Tim: Nice. iPad
01:10  simplicity-: <3 iPad
01:10  simplicity-: Pretty sweet little thing, eh?

01:40  richardcavell: Can I ask - I'm not trolling here - what can you do with an iPad?  it strikes me as being underpowered.
01:41  chipotle: can anyone tell me why when i open a new tab in safari (sometimes) i see a bunch of mashed images together of things i was viewing earlier, before my "preview" of most recent sites comes up...?
01:41  chipotle: richardcavell: i wouldn't use it as a computer
01:42  chipotle: richardcavell: if i were to get an iPad, it is becaue i want an ebook reader that can handle technical PDFs 
01:42  chipotle: i wouldn't use my ipad in my daily life when i use my iphone (too large)
01:42  chipotle: though i guess sitting next to my nightstand if i want to look something up quickly isn't so bad, but for me, i don't want to spend $600 to do that (and my company wouldn't pay for it)
01:44  richardcavell: I'm thinking MBP or MBA for me
01:45  richardcavell: I want 4 Gig RAM
01:48  torchie: 4 gigs is not enough
01:49  torchie: the ipad
01:49  torchie: is anything you want
01:50  alexlea: richardcavell: underpowered is a subjective observation; there are MANY people that only want an ebook reader, music/movie player, web searching device
01:52  alexlea: i see people in starbucks often with them; young people tend to have both an ipad and laptop with them, which to me seems redundant, but i see alot of old people with ipads too...reading from them as they sip their coffee
01:53 +EdLin: torchie, how do you like your nook color?
01:56  zzing: 4GB should be enough for anyone :p
01:57  torchie: it's fantastic
01:58  torchie: occasional incompatibility/derpness though
01:58  torchie: other than that it's lightning fast, runs tons of apps, has great battery life, and is the size of a mark twain paperback
01:59  torchie: the epub reader is great, but the pdf reader is balls
01:59  torchie: that can be changed though for a couple of bux
01:59 +EdLin: does it need to be hacked to run stuff from the android market?
02:00  chipotle: jesus christ, this is using 13GB of swap! 
02:01  chipotle: does anyone here familiar with mounting external HDDs from windows computers? i formatted it for OS X but it's obviously still not liking me. 
02:01  chipotle: it's unplugged and mount_ccdafs is using 2GB of real memory and ~13GB of virtual memory
02:01 +au: hello!
02:01 +EdLin: chipotle, if you want to mount an hfs+ osx drive, buy macdrive.
02:01  chipotle: 4gb doesn't work for me
02:02 +EdLin: !g macdrive windows hfs+

02:02  alexlea: chipotle: i'm not sure what you are saying. you mean it was originally in a windows computer? or are you trying to view it from windows
02:02  chipotle: EdLin: i don't know what it was before (should have checked, heh)... i just formatted it as 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)' and thought i could use it solely on OS X now
02:03  chipotle: EdLin: i want to wipe the contents and use it on OS X exclusively
02:03 +EdLin: chipotle, sure. mac os extended journaled case insensitive, that's for os x.
02:03  chipotle: this external hdd also puts a "virtual cdrom" in the sidebar of disk utility, but i can't edit that either
02:03 +EdLin: chipotle, what do you mean?
02:03  chipotle: i think that is what's causing mount_cddafs to freak out -- from what i remember, that is about cdrom mounts, not sata hdd
02:05  chipotle: richardcavell: most likely, i would recommend the pro models. what's your budget and what will you do with the machine?
02:05  alexlea: chipotle: repartition the drive, instead of just reformatting
02:05  chipotle: EdLin: i dunno, this device is from "clickfree" (goclickfree.com) and it mounts a greyed out virtual CD that can't be ejected/formatted or modified in any way. when i go to /Volumes in terminal, i don't see it. 
02:06  chipotle: alexlea: so format it, then partition it as 1 drive?
02:06  chipotle: now swap is at 18gb. reboot 
02:07  chipotle: (different computer)
02:07  alexlea: chipotle: no, you have to click the highest icon for he drive (instead of clicking a partition on the drive) and then click partition tab, tell it how many you want adn select the file system in that tab too
02:07  chipotle: alexlea: yeah, i did, did a format, and the virtual cd rom still appears 
02:08  chipotle: but i'll try partitioning after i reboot the machine. thanks! 
02:08  alexlea: ok
02:14  chipotle: alexlea: do you happen to know why sometimes when i open another tab in safari, my computer 'freezes' (or at least safari does) for 1-3 seconds and you see a bunch of mashed images of files/apps/movies/images you were viewing earlier, THEN the safari preview pane appears and it's back to normal
02:14  chipotle: i'm assuming it is because of memory issues? 
02:15  alexlea: chipotle: do you regularly reset safari?
02:15  bsdbandit: does anyone use apple tv 
02:15  bsdbandit: ?
02:15  bsdbandit: i was thinking about getting one
02:16  alexlea: chipotle: i don't know what could be causing it, but restting safari and or deleting the plist should correct it
02:16  alexlea: maybe even just empting the cache might fix it too
02:18  chipotle: alexlea: cache from safari? 
02:18  alexlea: chipotle: yeah
02:19  chipotle: eh, then i lose my preferences, no?
02:19  chipotle: i guess that would make sense if it were just webpages, but it seems to be all sorts of files from all sorts of apps
02:19  alexlea: chipotle: not from emptying the cache; reset will lose stuff depending on how you have it set up...deleting a plist will delete prefs...so basicaly iw oudl just try emptying the cache first
02:20  chipotle: where's the plist?
02:20  jsoft_: plist? 
02:20  alexlea: hold on i will check
02:20  jsoft_: plist as in property list|? As in (list :a 1 :b 2) ?
02:20  chipotle: yeah
02:21  pcundco: Wie heist der standart bildschirmschoner fon mac osx ?
02:22  chipotle: and, how can i get nightly builds of google chrome on mac
02:22  chipotle: pcundco: system prefs, display
02:23  alexlea: pcundco: or right click desktop, change desktop, and click screensaver tab
02:23  profxavier: hi guys, I copied a folder to my HD folder, and I am trying to apply permissions for another user to view this folder, plus all its subfolders
02:24  profxavier: how can I recursively do this? or suggest some other method.
02:24  chipotle: pcundco: sry, my german isn't that great. 
02:25  alexlea: chipotle: user/library/preferences/com.apple.Safari
02:25  alexlea: profxavier: right click, get info
02:25  profxavier: t=yes
02:26  profxavier: then what do I do, so it applies to the subfolders ?
02:26  chipotle: alexlea: i did a partition rather than a format, and still the virtual cdrom shows up. it is called "240.8 MB SAC Virtual Cdrom Media"
02:27  richardcavell: chipotle: sorry, I was playing Deus Ex.  I want to replace my 2006 MacBook.  The battery has had it.  I've upgraded the hard disk, memory and OS X version on the old MacBook but I can't upgrade the GPU, which sux (GMA 945).  It's my main system.  I use it for everything including coding.
02:27  chipotle: it says write abilities, read only ((null)) and artition map scheme is unformatted. connected via external usb
02:27  profxavier: i added the user, and gave the privilege
02:27  profxavier: but it only applies to the folder
02:27  profxavier: not its subfolders
02:27  pcundco: What is the standard screen saver mac os x?
02:27  chipotle: i wanna nuke it forever
02:29  jsoft_: profxavier: use -R with chmod
02:29  jsoft_: chmod -R 750 or whatever
02:29  alexlea: chipotle: um, maybe try partition tab/file system tupe, then click the partition, and click options, and change it to guid or something

02:40  alexlea: and the fact you can never upgrade the ram
02:40  chipotle: richardcavell: new SSD technology should be released in the next month or two. i would highly recommend waiting for them
02:40 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 76 seconds
02:40  chipotle: faster, larger, cheaper
02:40  richardcavell: well I'd be upgrading to 4 gig
02:40  chipotle: profxavier: recursive -R
02:40  richardcavell: I want the 4 gig 11" MBA, which is the same price as the 13" MBP which comes with 4 gig
02:40  alexlea: if a 3rd party company come out with a cover for the screen, that minmicks the pro glass...i would totally get a mba
02:41  richardcavell: chipotle: you mean Apple's coming out with it or generally?
02:41  alexlea: i dont need glass, i just want black edges, and protection...cause my white macbook screen has scuff marks, etc all over it
02:41  richardcavell: I reckon Apple hardware options will always be behind the PC market
02:41  bsdbandit: cool 
02:42  chipotle: alexlea: the external HDD (main button) is set as "GUID partition table" already... i can't edit that virtual cdrom... anything else i can do?
02:42  chipotle: richardcavell: generally. apple is slow to adopt
02:42  bsdbandit: anyone using apple tv ?
02:42  bsdbandit: im thinking about getting one 
02:42  bsdbandit: how is it 
02:42  bsdbandit: ?
02:43  chipotle: richardcavell: you could replace the battery, unless you want something new. if you get a mbp, you can keep the hdd (easy to pull out and put into a mbp, see ifixit.com)
02:44  chipotle: richardcavell: the current 13 MBP video card sucks as well. i can't imagine the mba being any better
02:44  richardcavell: it's the same
02:44  richardcavell: 320m
02:44  richardcavell: nvidia 
02:44  richardcavell: it doesn't suck anywhere near as bad as the GMA945 sucks
02:44  richardcavell: I know I can replace the battery but I've already done that once
02:47  chipotle: richardcavell: well, buying a new computer because the battery has had it, seems stupid. get a new computer because you need it. batteries will always continue to die. 
02:48  band-aid: Anyone know why I cannot sign into game center? whenever I try to sign in it takes me to the new account screen.
02:49  band-aid: this is on an ipad btw
02:50  richardcavell: The MBP one is not user-serviceable either
02:51  alexlea: you can still replace it though, you just need some precision screwdrivers and a wingtip screwdriver
02:51  alexlea: or tri-tip...whatever it is called
02:52  jsoft_: :)
02:53  richardcavell: Well it's $200 for a new battery, $1500 for a new Mac
02:54  richardcavell: And I'm on welfare :(
02:59  richardcavell: tell me to do the sensible thing
03:03  jsoft_: er get a battery?
03:10  chipotle: lol
03:10  richardcavell: yeah
03:10  alexlea: richardcavell: if you are on welfare i reccomend the mbp
03:11  alexlea: because that old macbook is dying, and buying a battery is throwing money at something that is gonna fail soon
03:11  richardcavell: well, it's not dying
03:11  alexlea: are you in the US?
03:11  richardcavell: the optical drive no longer works but I have an external one and rarely use it anyway
03:11  richardcavell: Australia
03:11  richardcavell: If I get a new battery I might get another year out of old faithful
03:12  alexlea: oh...i am in the US, and if there is a state where i could afford a mbp on welfare, i would totally move there
03:12  richardcavell: ha ha
03:12  alexlea: richardcavell: i have a plan once i can afford a mbp...at the end of every year, or possibly every 2 years, sell it, and have to contribute at most 300 of my own money to get a new one
03:12  richardcavell: The US dosn't have as strong a welfare system
03:13  alexlea: us welfare is pretty much non existent unless you have kids
03:13  richardcavell: I'm bloody lucky to be in a country that has one
03:13  richardcavell: I know that
03:13  alexlea: i have been homeless the past 2 years...though i am not now
03:13  richardcavell: me too
03:13  alexlea: i am staying with my brother for awhile...but soon back to the oceans of LA
03:14  alexlea: richardcavell: you're homeless now?
03:14  richardcavell: was
03:14  unrealjeff: hi alexlea 
03:14  richardcavell: not now
03:14  richardcavell: I get $330 / week on Disability Pension
03:14  alexlea: hey unrealjeff
03:14  alexlea: richardcavell: were you staying with people, in a car, what
03:14  richardcavell: in a car
03:14  unrealjeff: it can happen to anyone
03:15  richardcavell: I'm a fully qualified doctor but I developed post-traumatic stress disorder about 3 years ago
03:15  alexlea: richardcavell: thats how i do it...i got an RV 3 montgs ago though, so i guess its not the same now...but befoere i had a bronco 2, which are small and lived in it for nearly 2 years
03:15  richardcavell: I hit the wall in a big way
03:16  alexlea: i've been scrwed up my whole life...i have a hard time understanding being a doctor then going insane
03:16  richardcavell: Yeah I'd love an RV in case it ever happens again
03:16  richardcavell: Well, believe it
03:16  alexlea: richardcavell: what happened? was it sudden, or snow ball effect?
03:16  richardcavell: I'm a fully qualified doctor and I have PTSD which pretty much prevents me from working safely
03:16  alexlea: rv's use way too much gas..i'd actually rather have the bronco 2 agian...or rather, something in between, maybe a bigger truck
03:17  richardcavell: No, it relates to something that happened more than 10 years ago.  I threatened to sue a prostitute who was also a medical student for misdiagnosing me, and she responded by having me bashed within an inch of my life
03:17  richardcavell: I'd like to have a car that is big enough to live in
03:17  unrealjeff: it would be fun to live in a nicely organized van and travel 
03:17  unrealjeff: i think
03:17  alexlea: unrealjeff: it is totally fun
03:17  richardcavell: Some RVs are really nice
03:17  richardcavell: like luxury yachts
03:17  richardcavell: I don't think we have that kind of RV culture here in Australia
03:17  richardcavell: I'd love to live on a yacht
03:18  alexlea: yeah, my rv is not like taht...its more of a camper van...it has an added few inches/feet of roof space, so you can stand in it...and it has a shower and stove in it
03:18  alexlea: there is a bed over the front seats, and one n the back...but i use he floor instead
03:19  richardcavell: Does it have a toilet?
03:19  alexlea: well, i have a mattress, etc...i dont wannna sleep 6 feet off the floor, where the official beds are because thats a pain
03:19  jsoft_: ffs.
03:19  alexlea: unrealjeff: i crosssed the country 5-6 times the past 2 years...i have finally gone to all 48 lower states
03:19  jsoft_: my stupid windows laptop turned off due to overheating during a game.
03:19  unrealjeff: alexlea: alaska is next
03:19  jsoft_: While a heap.
03:20  jsoft_: What a heap, even.
03:20  unrealjeff: jsoft_: that's awesome
03:20  alexlea: unrealjeff: alaska is difficult....2000+ miles to drive, and candain gas is hell a expensive...or take a hella expensive ferry
03:20  alexlea: by ferry, its like 600 miles, because you can depart from bellingham, and hit the southern tip of the peninsula
03:20  unrealjeff: dang
03:21  alexlea: and that 2000 miles is just through canada, i would have to add another 1500 cause i am in socal
03:21  richardcavell: When my MacBook says my battery has 74% health, what does the percent refer to?
03:21  richardcavell: The battery still holds charge for a couple of hours
03:22  richardcavell: although it's lost its zero point.  It goes dead at 12% remaining
03:22  alexlea: richardcavell: http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/
03:22  alexlea: richardcavell: that app tells you alot about your battery
03:23  richardcavell: thanks alexlea
03:23  richardcavell: istatpro says my battery has done 289 cycles and has 74% health
03:24  unrealjeff: jsoft_: dont use windows, if you want to game get an xbox 360 or PS3... xbox 360 system with controller is about the same price as windows 7 
03:24  richardcavell: see the design capacity is 5.02 Amp hours and it still holds 3.7 Amp hours
03:24  richardcavell: that's still usable
03:24  alexlea: mine has 419 cycles
03:25  richardcavell: it's less than it's designed for, but it still bloody works
03:25  alexlea: and i guess 95% health
03:28  alexlea: richardcavell: no, no toilet...it did, but i removed it (didnt want to deal with having to empty/maintain that)
03:29  unrealjeff: alexlea: i've been truckin before a lot. a simple bottle will do the job ;)
03:30  alexlea: unrealjeff: for a guy maybe
03:31  alexlea: i *only* sleep in it anyway... i just make sure to stop by a gas station before i aprk for the night
03:32  richardcavell: There was a story about a girl band here in Australia that went on tour.  They had a nice bus and went to various towns and stayed in motels.  They said they preferred to sleep in the bus because the motels were sometimes pretty downmarket
03:34  richardcavell: Well for my Christmas present I'll get a battery for my MacBook
03:34  richardcavell: Keep the damn machine for another year
03:38  unrealjeff: i saw a macbook pro for 1499 at best buy 13 inch screen, 4GB ram core 2 duo. HP for 799, 6GB of the same type of ram i5 processor.
03:38  unrealjeff: wut
03:38  unrealjeff: i thinnk the HP was 15 inch also
03:39  richardcavell: Yeah the Macs are expensive.  But I've invested in the software and the platform and I like it
03:47  alexlea: i only like teh appearence of the macs
03:47  alexlea: if pc laptops were cuter i would get a pc
03:48 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
03:48  alexlea: i would have to run linux on it tho
03:50  yazdmich: i like macs for the OS and the look
03:50  yazdmich: so clean and simple
03:51  yazdmich: aqua <3
03:52  alexlea: i have equal complaints about all os-es...
03:53  alexlea: osx=no customisation ; windows=too easy to get viruses, etc, linux=too many options which leads to incompatibilities...plus driver support
03:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v danl]
03:58  unrealjeff: yes gnome is like the most custom UI out there. that's why i luv it
03:59  yazdmich: YES
03:59  yazdmich: WINE BOTTLER AND MIRC FOR THE WIN
03:59  yazdmich: i will soon be running mirc on OSX
03:59  alexlea: why
04:00  alexlea: why not explore osx irc options
04:00  yazdmich: best irc client i have ever used
04:00  yazdmich: i dont like searching for extra clients
04:00  yazdmich: i have aspergers
04:01  yazdmich: im stiff like that
04:01  alexlea: to me it just makes more sense to use an app that is tailored to one's OS
04:02  LordHawke13: Okay. Question with iTunes. . .
04:02  LordHawke13: I have some albums with songs by different artists.
04:03  LordHawke13: Without putting them in playlists, when sorting the library by album by artist name, can I have the songs in these albums be put together instead of separated by artist name?
04:05  alexlea: LordHawke13: you could arrange by "album artist" , i am assuming you are having issues with compilations/various artist situations?
04:07  LordHawke13: ARE YOU A WIZARD!?
04:08  LordHawke13: OMFGROFLMAOBBQ Thank you so much!!
04:08  alexlea: :) you're welcome
04:08  LordHawke13: I have been looking for this for YEARS!!
04:08  LordHawke13: Just never found the place to ask, I guess. . .
04:09  alexlea: i have spent WAY TOO MANY hours playing with itunes
04:09  unrealjeff: alexlea: i know
04:10  alexlea: and i learn new stuff all the time, most recently i learned abotu teh pop out window that has the album art and play controls
04:15  unrealjeff: he ditched you
04:15  alexlea: many do...they come in just for help
04:15  alexlea: which is cool
04:16  yazdmich: damn
04:16  yazdmich: winebottler didn't work
04:17  unrealjeff: yazdmich: :D
04:17  yazdmich: thats open source software for ya
04:17  unrealjeff: alexlea: he's back
04:17  LordHawke: Okay, back again, with another question. . .
04:17  LordHawke: :P
04:17  unrealjeff: yazdmich: open source is teh futar
04:17  LordHawke: So, everyone's got iPhones. We just got Apple TV.
04:18  LordHawke: Today, we all got some kick ass noise canceling headphones.
04:18  alexlea: yazdmich: limechat, macirssi, colloquy, xchat aqua, linkinus (not free), and textual...those are the top osx irc apps...try one you may like it
04:18  LordHawke: Can we have Apple TV play the audio through our iPhones with the Remote app so that we can use our headphones to listen?
04:18  yazdmich: i will be porting mirc to my mac
04:18  unrealjeff: webchat
04:18  unrealjeff: best
04:19 * yazdmich slaps unrealjeff with his macbook
04:20 * LordHawke would have rather used the pink Dell netbook sitting next to him. The MacBook, he cares about it too much. . .
04:21  alexlea: i'm sure there is a way, but it would require some kind of hack or 3rd aprty app 
04:21 * unrealjeff praises yazdmich for letting him touch an apple product.
04:22  webPragmatist: why does mac blow?
04:22 * yazdmich slaps unrealjeff with an iPad
04:22  unrealjeff: webPragmatist: compared to?
04:23  yazdmich: whats the dev channel?
04:23  yazdmich: maybe someone there will know about wine
04:23 * unrealjeff goes and eats maccaroni and cheese in fear of yazdmich and his apple product pain giving.
04:24  yazdmich: those slaps were for mentioning webchat in here
04:25  unrealjeff: yazdmich: what's wrong with it?
04:26  yazdmich: its inferior to every client but xchat
04:27  unrealjeff: it's useable
04:27  yazdmich: its inferior
04:29  unrealjeff: that's an opinion
04:31  yazdmich: damnit 
04:31  yazdmich: i had to join #ubuntu to get help
04:31  unrealjeff: ubuntu is the best OS
04:31  unrealjeff: don't knock it
04:32  yazdmich: i hate it
04:32 @bashusr: woah
04:32  unrealjeff: why?
04:32  unrealjeff: yazdmich: why?
04:32 @bashusr: what's the isssue yazdmich ?
04:33 @bashusr: nobody uses wine on Mac
04:33 @bashusr: everyone uses Parallels or Vbox
04:33  yazdmich: ubuntu wouldn't work on my old pent 4
04:33 @bashusr: off topic?
04:33  yazdmich: wine packages windows programs
04:33  yazdmich: to work on osx
04:34 @bashusr: really?

05:20  alexlea: florida is like a bad version of california; no mountans, humidity, southerners....
05:22  alexlea: way better beaches though... :(
05:22 * alexlea steals floridas beaches and puts them in cali
05:22  richardcavell: California has decent beaches, doesn't it?
05:23  alexlea: richardcavell: depends on your definition of decent; dark sand course, really cold water....as opposed to florida white powdery sand beches, warm water,
05:23  alexlea: in cali, the ocean is good for surfing, thats about it...florida is better for swimming
05:23  windowsISbad: Windows is probably the best Operating System that has ever graced the personal computer.
05:24  alexlea: you can go really far from the coast, and the water is still waist high in florida

07:00  nexus741: hello
07:07  zzing: chipotle: Arrr, extract the rar file, get rid o' the subtitles you do not want, and then rar it up again. Aye.
07:09  numberz: is it just me or does iTunes 10.1 really struggle when adding media say from a smb share?
07:10  windowsISbad: hi friends
07:10  nexus74: numberz: itunes really needs to be streamlined
07:10  Kasm279: ^
07:11  nexus74: I can't even scroll through the music store (a artisits album list for example) with the scroll constantly stalling
07:11  zzing: windowsISbad: You have brought a dark cloud of windows hatred with you. We only want care bears here. *spreads rainbows*
07:11  zzing: nexus74: How much music have you?
07:12  nexus74: not a lot,  I'm talking about when I search for a song title on iTunes store, lets say you get 50 songs with that word or title in the name.  When I go to scroll, it constantly hangs
07:12  nexus74: It makes me not want to use it
07:12  nexus74: I'm on a mac, and I love apple products, but iTunes needs work
07:12  zzing: I can concur with that. I remember a day when iTunes was well a music player.
07:13  nexus74: before the iTunes store came out, is iTunes how you transferred music to your iPod?
07:13  nexus74: iPod came out in 2001, iTunes store didn't arrive till 03
07:14  zzing: nexus74: I didn't have an ipod until last year.
07:15  zzing: Actually it has only been about a year. I don't even use it anymore.
07:15  nexus74: so how do you get music on your pod?
07:16  Kasm279: nexus74: Roxio
07:16  Kasm279: was on windows
07:16  Kasm279: and wait
07:16  zzing: iTunes is what I have used for that
07:16  nexus74: ah
07:16  Kasm279: nexus74: are you sure about that?
07:17  nexus74: Kasm279: sure about what
07:17  Kasm279: the date of itunes
07:17  nexus74: last documentary I saw said that, i'll check
07:17  Kasm279: nope
07:17  Kasm279: Jan 9, 2001
07:18  nexus74: The iTunes Store is a software-based online digital media store operated by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.. Opening as the iTunes Music Store on April 28, 2003, with over 200,000 items to purchase,
07:18  Kasm279: iTunes has been out longer though
07:18  Kasm279: you ripped CDs before that
07:18  nexus74: yes sir, but I'm talking about the store
07:19  zzing: nexus74: You seem confused.
07:20  nexus74: I thought iTunes was a music player before the iTunes store came out…yeah I guess I am confused
07:20 --- windowsISbad is now known as yeahim12
07:21  nexus74: iPod came out in 01…so I was curious as to how folk where transferring music to their pod
07:21  zzing: nexus74: Mac users were using iTunes, Windows users had other software. But neither had to be exclusive.
07:21  nexus74: so, itunes did exist before iTunes store...
07:22  Kasm279: nexus74: iTunes came out for the iPod
07:22  nexus74: right
07:22  Kasm279: iTunes then was only for playing media and syncing
07:22  Kasm279: two years later apple introduced the store
07:22  nexus74: iTunes, then eventually iTunes *with* the itunes store
07:22  nexus74: exactly
07:22  Kasm279: yes
07:23  nexus74: that's what I thought
07:23  Kasm279: with the original iTunes minus the store you can rip music from CDs and get files from your hard drive to put on the iPod
07:23  nexus74: that's what i was thinking
07:24  nexus74: but none the less, iTunes needs to streamlined, like google chrome
07:24  nexus74: lighter weight
07:26  zzing: nexus74: nothing like google chrome
07:26  zzing: It needs to be engineered properly, that is all.
07:26  nexus74: I was just using that as an example of what, to me, appears to be a very lightweight app
07:26  richardcavell: How crowded will Chadstone be today?
07:26  richardcavell: now?
07:26  zzing: Notepad is a light weight app
07:27  nexus74: even better! lol
07:28  nexus74: richardcavell: what is chadstone?
07:28  richardcavell: shopping centre here
07:28  richardcavell: Thought I was talking in #australia sorry
07:28  nexus74: ah
07:29  chipotle: zzing: i tried, but it starts at the beginning of the archive
07:30  richardcavell: nexus74: mind you it's so I can visit the Apple Store and buy my MacBook a new battery
07:30  zzing: chipotle: What do you mean?
07:30  nexus74: richardcavell: chadstone to visit apple store?
07:31  chipotle: zzing: i tried to extra just r93 but it starts at r00 and goes through the entire 93 parts to create the actual file (i am using unrarx)
07:31  zzing: chipotle: I don't understand. Are you saying you have .rar, r00, ... r93, and you want to distribute it?
07:31  Kasm279: chipotle: extract the rar
07:31  chipotle: zzing: erm, i just moved it into another folder, and tried again, and got this: WARNING: You need to start extraction from a previous volume to unpack mhq-casino.1995.720p.x264.mkv No files to extract
07:31  Kasm279: remove what you don't want
07:32  Kasm279: and re archive it
07:32  chipotle: zzing: i want to remove the subtitles. i *assume* they are in r93 since r93 is only 3MB
07:32 * Kasm279 facepalms
07:32  zzing: chipotle: You have to have the entire set of archive to extract from a rar file
07:32  Kasm279: chipotle: extract the file and turn them off in the movie player
07:32 * zzing joins Kasm279
07:33  zzing: chipotle: Check to make sure your computer is unplugged and the battery is removed before continuing. It will save a lot of trouble in the long run.
07:33  richardcavell: chipotle: he's being silly
07:33  chipotle: that would be a nice life, zzing 
07:33  richardcavell: You can't assume the subtitles are in the last .rar file
07:33  richardcavell: they're probably all through the movie
07:34  zzing: Are these subtitles even a separate file? Could they be burned in?
07:34  Kasm279: they aren't a seperate file
07:34  Kasm279: well
07:34  chipotle: thanks Kasm279 . i just got into watching movies, so am grabbing bluray versions of movies i enjoyed many years ago  
07:34  Kasm279: you can have subtitles in a seperate fuke
07:34  Kasm279: file more like
07:34  Kasm279: anyway
07:34  zzing: chipotle: Arrr ye pirating films off the internet mate?
07:35  richardcavell: Arr me hearties
07:35  Kasm279: but most of the time they are integrated
07:36  chipotle: how do you disable subtitles completely from vlc?
07:36  Kasm279: >video>subtitles track>disable
07:37  chipotle: thanks :)
07:37  zzing: Only if they are not hard coded
07:38  Kasm279: hard coced isn't the correct word
07:38  Kasm279: coded*
07:38  chipotle: i figured it would be in a separate file since what i remember from years back (when i last watched a movie on my computer)
07:38  Kasm279: if its actually in the video, which is unlikely
07:38  Kasm279: then you can't disable them
07:38  chipotle: good to know you can just disable them when watching a video, through the video player
07:38  Kasm279: must of the time they are in the same container file as the video but still seperate
07:39  chipotle: i thought they were in a separate file, now an mkv itself? i guess mkv allows for a subtitle file inside? (i forget the format i remember seeing)
07:39  Kasm279: a lot of formats alllow subtitles in them
07:39  zzing: chipotle: as Kasm279 says. There are a lot of different formats. AVI is one that is likely burned in, or separate file. 
07:40  chipotle: i see. 
07:40  chipotle: what's the major differences between avi and mkv? it seems avi is best for smaller (under 1GB video), whereas mkv is for larger video files?
07:41  zzing: chipotle: AVI is a relic
07:41  zzing: MKV supports vast more options
07:41  zzing: AVI has been extended in ways that are not always consistent with all players
07:41  zzing: Some newer audio formats can't even be properly put into avi
07:42  chipotle: and x264 is an audio format?
07:42  zzing: I don't care for mkv myself, I prefer AVI or mp4
07:42  zzing: x264 is an encoder for H.264 which is MPEG4 Part 10
07:42  zzing: It is a video format only
07:42  chipotle: zzing: mp4 is apple's baby, right?
07:43  zzing: chipotle: It is used by apple, and primarily supported by them, but no it is quite 'standard' the same way mpeg 2 is standard (dvds, et al.)
07:46  chipotle: i see
07:46  chipotle: zzing: so why do you dislike mkv? how does the difference between mkv and mp4 affect your life (i'm not being facetious at all)?
07:47  zzing: chipotle: Things I use generally support mp4 much better
07:47  zzing: That being wiimc (avi and mp4 work best), and ipad (mp4 works best)
07:47  chipotle: oh, you mean watching on an iPhone?
07:47  chipotle: (or other apple products)?
07:48  zzing: Also quicktime isn't a fan of mkv, but it can use it
07:48  chipotle: i don't know where i'd try to watch a 15GB video, other than my computer, so i don't see how i'd be limited
07:48  chipotle: through perian, right?
07:48  zzing: yes
07:48  zzing: What on earth do you need a 15gb video for?
07:49  chipotle: i prefer quicktime because vlc's keyboard shortcuts do not like me for whatever reason. i have tried REPEATEDLY to make it so when i press the play/pause keyboard button, vlc doesn't start the last movie i played
07:49  chipotle: zzing: dunno the differences between compression, but isn't 1080p movies typically 10-15GB?
07:50  zzing: hmm, I wouldn't know I don't keep 1080p videos around
07:50  zzing: My videos are usually between 240 and 480
07:50  chipotle: zzing: you never watch videos at a higher res?
07:50  zzing: No, why would I want to?
07:51  chipotle: zzing: never watched a movie or tv show?
07:51  chipotle: even youtube videos are typically around 500x400
07:51  zzing: chipotle: I have more movies and tv shows then I can count
07:52  chipotle: zzing: 240 and 480 what?
07:52  zzing: I have a 2TB drive dedicated to various things
07:52  zzing: vertical resolution
07:52  chipotle: zzing: why don't you want to watch a movie larger than that?  
07:52  zzing: I don't see any point
07:53  chipotle: me neither, until i got a 17 mbp
07:53  zzing: I found just now the largest video I have is 1920x800 pixels and with 5.1 sound, H264 it is 4.37GB and is just over 2 hours long.
07:53  chipotle: now i want to get some type of tv for the first time in ~10 years, to watch videos/tv shows on
07:56  zzing: I watch videos on a TV with RCA cables
07:59  Kasm279: i watch videos on my computer
07:59  Kasm279: on a 1680x1050 screen
08:00  zzing: I do have a 15" mbp screen for sometimes too
08:01  Kasm279: gah
08:02  Kasm279: i can't wait for FLCL to come out on bluray
08:02  Kasm279: DVD quality is kinda low res
08:02  zzing: I love dvd res
08:03  Kasm279: i mean
08:03  Kasm279: its ok
08:03  Kasm279: but tiny on this screen
08:03  zzing: Its good enough for most people

08:40  svm_invictvs: I've got a macbook 13 inch
08:40  svm_invictvs: And it will shut itself off when running on battery
08:40  svm_invictvs: No warning, no safe shutdown, just turn itself off.
08:40  svm_invictvs: And it will happens when the cPU is under load.
08:41  svm_invictvs: Even if the battery level is up above 80%
08:41  svm_invictvs: Where does mac keep its logs so I could figure out what's going on.
08:41  svm_invictvs: I think this is an overheating issue, anybody have any ideas?
08:41  numberz: you can monitor temps
08:41  svm_invictvs: Where doy ou do that?
08:42  numberz: istat menus has a module... sure there are others
08:42  svm_invictvs: I dropped it a week ago, I wonder if I damanged the cooling system.
08:43  svm_invictvs: Probalby ought ot take this shit apart
08:43  numberz: watch your language if you don't want to get booted :)
08:44  numberz: also may want to look into a program called smc fan control i think...
08:45  svm_invictvs: 50 and 52 C
08:45  numberz: someone else had an overheating problem and discovered one of the fans had died via that program
08:45  svm_invictvs: Well, this only started happening recently.
08:45  numberz: the c2d cutoff is 110°C or around that
08:45  svm_invictvs: It hit the ground pretty hard.  I had a toshiba do the same thing
08:45  svm_invictvs: I dropped it and then it slowly went downhill.
08:45  svm_invictvs: BUt, I could be wrong.
08:46  svm_invictvs: Yeah, I loaded up Starcraft II and then the thing just dropped like a brick.
08:48  svm_invictvs: hm.

09:02  jsoft: *yawn*
09:40 * richardcavell yawns too
09:40  richardcavell: Anyone know how the MacBook battery is supposed to degrade over time?  Does the capacity just reduce linearly?
09:41  richardcavell: Branes was telling me that a cell might have collapsed, but the voltage still seems good.  It's the capacity that's only 3/4 what it should be
09:42  svm_invictvs: I'm not 100% sure, but I'm fairly certain that if a cell dies then the voltage was dropped.
09:42  richardcavell: 12.5 Volts
09:42  svm_invictvs: iirc, a battery can only produce 1.5 volts or so.
09:42  richardcavell: Yeah it seems logical to me that if a cell collapses, it'll go less than that
09:42  svm_invictvs: So to make a 12 v battery they stack them.
09:42  svm_invictvs: Yeah
09:42  richardcavell: Mind you, I've heard people say that they've run their MacBooks on 10 Volts
09:42  svm_invictvs: Yeah, well, i'm sure you end up with problems doing that.
09:43  svm_invictvs: I dunno
09:43  richardcavell: See at 12.5 Volts I think all the cells are working, it's just that the capacity reduced suddenly without explanation
09:43  svm_invictvs: I don't know how the batteries are supposed to degrade.
09:59  nexus74: anyone here beta testing Lion?
10:01  nexus74: I'm not sure if Apple even allows that for Lioin
10:02  jsoft: Allows what?
10:02  nexus74: beta testing for Lion
10:05  S_SubZero: I'm sure they have internal testing.  I don't think "HAY GUYZ CHECK OUT MY LION BETA" is really gonna happen.
10:06  nexus74: Has Apple ever had public beta testing for any of it's apps?
10:06  S_SubZero: I dont know.  I am not aware of any
10:06  jsoft: Yes they do.
10:07  jsoft: Well at least I seem to end up with all this pre-release shit 
10:07  jsoft: Part of the apple developer program stuff
10:07  nexus74: oh you do?  You don''t sound too happy about that
10:07  jsoft: I dont remember seing lion in the latest email though
10:07  jsoft: I dont mind it
10:07  jsoft: Im just a bit grumpy after spending on hour trying to help a troll.
10:08  nexus74: How much is the developer program?  Is it the same dev program for iPhone
10:08  jsoft: yeah
10:08  jsoft: $99 (nzd anyway)
10:08  nexus74: So, it's $99
10:08  nexus74: ah
10:08  nexus74: man, I need to get that
10:08  jsoft: Indeed!
10:08  nexus74: how did you end up spending an hour on a troll
10:10  jsoft: well he was some guy wanting help setting up apache. Took ages to get answers out of him, etc. I thought he was just slow and a bit thick, but then illogical answers started coming back, contradictory ones.. yeah.
10:10  nexus74: i see

17:17 --- Guest8610 is now known as Bensawsome
17:25  Southron: AlHafoudh: I don't think so.
17:26  AlHafoudh: ok, so how to correctly "undock" my macbook? I have all plugged in, displayport, 2xusb,firewire,ethernet,audio and I wanto to sleep my mac and take him away with me
17:28  Southron: AlHafoudh: When I want to do that, I dismount all drives (USB or FireWire), then physically disconnect the USB from the Mac.
17:29  AlHafoudh: and how do you sleep it then?
17:29  Southron: Then I can put it to sleep and disconnect the display, Ethernet, audio, etc.
17:29  Southron: Either by closing the lid (and waiting till the light pulses steadily)
17:29  AlHafoudh: hmm, ok
17:30  Southron: or from the Apple menu, selecting sleep, etc.

17:35  Southron: Well, if so, you can open the lid before putting it to sleep and use the built-in keyboard.
17:35  Southron: Hope that helps.
17:39  AlHafoudh: i just read that i can disconnect everything like you said and it will exit the clamshell mode and go to sleep

19:10  thelostpatrol: can someone go on steampowered.com and tell me what the top/left-most game deal is? it's not allowing me to see it because of my region
19:10  evilbug: crilly: i tried but the screen will keep staying black either way.
19:12  crilly: evilbug, and resetting the PRAM still results in this?
19:13  evilbug: crilly: resetting pram will not do anything, the screen continues to stay black.
19:13  crilly: oh dear
19:13  crilly: Any beeps form the Mac at all? If you're still under warranty, I would take it into a store.
19:14  crilly: thelostpatrol, -75% off "Killing Floor Bundle"
