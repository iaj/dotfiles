00:00  S_SubZero: "modified tiger" = "snow leopard"
00:00  fujisan: :P Yeah you are so right
00:01  fujisan: but tiger is way faster than snow leopard
00:01  S_SubZero: Oh, you did extensive benchmarking of Tiger on a current MBA.  Link?
00:02  ErrantEgo: on the MBP, would you stick with the 5400 RPM hard drive
00:02  ErrantEgo: or would it be safe to get the 7200
00:05  crilly: ErrantEgo: The 7200RPM HDD is fine. Some people in here have them. I think Tomis does, Tu13es.
00:05  S_SubZero: i wouldn't get the 7200rpm from Apple directly.
00:05  crilly: I'd go with an SSD though, which is what am I buying in the new year.
00:05  ErrantEgo: the only thing i'd be afraid of is the overheating of the drive
00:05  ErrantEgo: you'd get teh SSD?
00:05  S_SubZero: So you believe Apple intentionally sells products that can overheat.
00:06  ErrantEgo: S_SubZero: did i say that/
00:06  S_SubZero: you hinted at it.
00:06  ErrantEgo: wrong.
00:06  ErrantEgo: i stated a fact of the hard drive as a whole
00:06  ErrantEgo: it has nothing to do with the mac
00:06  S_SubZero: good, you know full well Apple wouldn't sell a drive that would overheat.
00:07  crilly: Anyway, 7200RPM drives work fine in MBAs, I believe.
00:07  ErrantEgo: my father has some external 320 GB hard drives (about the same as what you would see in a laptop)
00:07  ErrantEgo: and it seems to run hot
00:08  ErrantEgo: crilly: what are the differences pretty much between the standard and SSD?
00:09  S_SubZero: Actually, store.apple.com won't configure a MBA with a regular hard drive.
00:09  ErrantEgo: im looking at the mbp's fwiw :p
00:10  ErrantEgo: im just curious what the difference is between the two
00:11  mrcrilly: ErrantEgo: speed
00:11  ErrantEgo: ah ok
00:11  S_SubZero: SSD is faster, more expensive, lower max capacities
00:11  mrcrilly: Huge speed differences. Look at the benchmarks.
00:11  ErrantEgo: im on the apple store website
00:11  ErrantEgo: the solid state seem to be expensive as hell
00:12  mrcrilly: From Appel, yes.
00:12  mrcrilly: Apple*

00:12  ErrantEgo: heh
00:12  ErrantEgo: i'd be afraid to open it
00:12  ErrantEgo: ive never actually opened a laptop before
00:13  crilly: SSDs make great main HDDs for the OS and applications. Platter based HDDs make great storage devices.
00:13  b3ny0-: http://www.editorskeys.com/ableton-live-keyboard.html
00:13  b3ny0-: perhaps I should get this
00:13  crilly: I will get a small SSD for the OS and applications and use external, networked storage for media and wok
00:14  ErrantEgo: Ugh.
00:14  S_SubZero: I'd assume the SSDs are also more resistant to shock and that sort of thing.
00:14  ErrantEgo: Damn.
00:14  ErrantEgo: i hate not knowing where else to look for things such as this
00:15  ErrantEgo: if it were like a mac mini or something, it'd be a different story
00:15  ErrantEgo: i dont wanna lug around an external hard drive if i get a macbook :p
00:15  S_SubZero: how much data do you plan to carry around on a regular basis?
00:15  S_SubZero: terabytes?
00:15  ErrantEgo: hell no
00:16  ErrantEgo: 256 GB would probably excessive
00:16  S_SubZero: a 128GB SSD is more than enough for the OS and a typical laptop's data loadout.
00:16  ErrantEgo: 128 is iffy
00:16  ErrantEgo: idk
00:16  ErrantEgo: from a 3rd party, what would each usually run?
00:16  ErrantEgo: (and what 3rd party would you recommend)
00:17  crilly: my mbp only has 160gb
00:17  ErrantEgo: if i could get a 200 GB, that would be a decent amount
00:17  crilly: I'd get a 256GB SSD probably.
00:17  ErrantEgo: or 256
00:17  ErrantEgo: whats a decent 3rd party seller
00:18  S_SubZero: www.newegg.com
00:18  ErrantEgo: brb

17:29  Untouchab1e: so the lock screen on my macbook is kinda failing
17:29  Untouchab1e: I lock the screen
17:29  Untouchab1e: and when I come back, the lock screen pops up, but so does everything else and I can still use the laptop and interact with the OS as normal
17:29  Untouchab1e: 8/10 times this doesnt happen, but it does occur and it poses a significant security risk
17:29  Untouchab1e: any ideas?
17:32 @ChrisAM: if you create a new user and try with that account, does it do the same thing?
17:33  Untouchab1e: ChrisAM: hmm, dont know.. gotta try it
17:35  thelostpatrol: it sounds like a software problem
17:36  Untouchab1e: yea, it def does
17:36  veovis_muaddib: Untouchab1e: I've also had that happen, but only once...
17:36  Untouchab1e: veovis_muaddib: yeah, it doesnt happen often for me either
17:36  Untouchab1e: so 8/10 was perhaps a bit off, but yeah
17:36  Untouchab1e: im just worried by the fact that it happened at all
17:37  veovis_muaddib: Untouchab1e: of course
17:40  thelostpatrol: ok time to play black ops
17:41  Untouchab1e: veovis_muaddib: yeaa, im surprised I cant find any info on the issue
17:43  veovis_muaddib: Untouchab1e: Kind of disturbing, but I figure if they have physical access to my machine, there's nothing I can do short of encrypt my drive, which would reduce performance in games...
17:43  veovis_muaddib: Untouchab1e: So I TrueCrypt my sensitive information and that's all
17:43  Untouchab1e: veovis_muaddib: well yeah, but a password protection would at least keep your nosy friends off the computer
17:44  Untouchab1e: yeaa, I have all my sensitive info on an IronKey with truecrypt on it
17:44  Untouchab1e: lol

18:56  Rav3nSw0rd: I have a triple boot mac book pro, and I want to upgrade my hard drive. Is there any simple way to preserve all three os's or do I have to backup each one individually, reinstall using blank hard drive, and then restore each? the second method sounds most tedious and annoying, so alternative solutions would be much preferred.

19:47  Nickeeh: Hi there! I just activated Filevault, made it erase my home directory. Upon completion, 2 warnings appeared right before it auto-rebooted. The warnings read something along the lines off: "An error has occured, Filevault will not be activated for this account". Now, it's "booting" (blue screen (heh.) with a spinning activity indicator) for more than an hour. Any idea what it's doing? 
19:50  Nickeeh: Luckily I made a full system backup yesterday. For the first time ever. Thank $deity. Buuutt I'd like to access my mac.
19:51  Nickeeh: I only don't have access to my OSX DVD at the moment.. that would've made things easier.
19:51  Nickeeh: Perhaps I'll just.. turn it off.
19:51  Nickeeh: Can't find anything on google. 
19:51  Nickeeh: with the term "file vault mac failure", no quotes in the query. 
19:52 @ChrisAM: I've never encountered that
19:54  Nickeeh: ... weird.
19:54  Nickeeh: rebooted it
19:55 @ChrisAM: works?
19:55  Nickeeh: as in, turned it off the hard way, started it
19:55  Nickeeh: works, no filevault tho. :/
19:55 @ChrisAM: try again I guess
19:55  Nickeeh: so what the hell has it been doing for those 2 hours? xD
19:55  Nickeeh: hahaha, glad it works anyway.. lets give a second try, yes.
19:55 @ChrisAM: Turning on filevault is the first thing I do after I install... before I put any files on it.
20:20  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah, my hdd keeps making a really high sound like when you run your finger round the rim of a glass
20:20  KeeperOfTheSoul: and a series of 2 clicks
20:21  Kasm279|Away: KeeperOfTheSoul: backup NOW
20:22  KeeperOfTheSoul: indeed
20:22  KeeperOfTheSoul: but its just a pain since this isn't a unibody
20:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
20:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: wonder how long this hdd will last, ah well was pondering if I should get a larger one
20:35  KeeperOfTheSoul: anyone know what OSX is like with a hybrid SSD drive?
20:35  KeeperOfTheSoul: such as http://www.ebuyer.com/product/222310
20:42  KeeperOfTheSoul: anyone know the specs for maximum size hdd a non-unibody macbook pro can accomodate?
20:43  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: 2.5"
20:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: but what height?
20:43  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: there are different heights?
20:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: yup
20:44  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: i'd think just about any popular laptop hdd would fit.
20:44  KeeperOfTheSoul: looks like they come in 9.5mm or 13mm
20:44  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: so if you keep away from obscure brands you should be fine.
20:45  KeeperOfTheSoul: I was looking at http://www.ebuyer.com/product/192247
20:45 +Branes: Keeps, 9.5mm is maximum clearance in almost all Apple laptops
20:45  KeeperOfTheSoul: ah right, so the 1TB is out
20:46 +Branes: fraid so
20:46  KeeperOfTheSoul: guess I'll go with this one then http://www.ebuyer.com/product/200796
20:46  KeeperOfTheSoul: still a step up from my 120GB I currently have
20:47  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: get an ssd >:D
20:47  evilbug: hey, Branes.
20:47  KeeperOfTheSoul: evilbug: yeah, but they are hell a expensive
20:47  veronicamars: hello
20:47  evilbug: hey.
20:47  KeeperOfTheSoul: was about 1,300 for 500GB or more
20:47  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: not the point ;)
20:48  evilbug: so they can't fit 1tb in a 9.5mm?
20:48 +Branes: he's after reliable storage, not unreliable, overly-expensive speed :)
20:48  KeeperOfTheSoul: it would appear not, for the moment
20:48 +Branes: not yet, no
20:48  evilbug: Branes: pssshhhh... reliability. who needs that?
20:49  evilbug: gotta get that fps!!!
20:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah, this means I now have to get a new external drive as well
20:49 +Branes: Me, for one -- it's why I don't own anything with an Intel in it :)
20:49  evilbug: Branes: har har. i can't agree with you on the intel, haven't had trouble with it myself.
20:50  veronicamars: Branes many macusers to have forgotten what intel's nickname was
20:50 +Branes: You don't have to fix the bloody things. I do :)
20:50  veronicamars: it used to be wintel
20:50  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: do you use an external mainly for storage?
20:50  veronicamars: so now Macs have wintel cpu's
20:50 +Branes: It's always been "Inthell" as far as I'm concerned. Endian little hate i.
20:50  KeeperOfTheSoul: evilbug: naw, backup
20:50  S_SubZero: veronicamars: "now" being for the last five years or so, yes.
20:50  evilbug: Branes: what are the issues you encounter?
20:50  evilbug: S_SubZero: hey.
20:51  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: what connection do you use?
20:51  KeeperOfTheSoul: usb
20:51  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: ah, ok.
20:51 +Branes: How would I know, I don't use any! I just fix the bloody things because they break down far far too often
20:51  KeeperOfTheSoul: firewire 800 is probably faster, but only my laptop has that connection
20:52  KeeperOfTheSoul: and no esata on the laptop
20:52  evilbug: Branes: that's what i was referring to.
20:52 +Branes: Keeps, FW400 is faster than USB2.
20:52 +Branes: And you can run an FW400 device off an FW800 port, you just need the appropriate cable.
20:52  evilbug: for esata i wouldn't get a cheap consumer hdd.
20:52 +Branes: I wouldn't get eSATA anything. It's a hack on top of a hack.
20:53 +Branes: It's why Apple refuse to add it.
20:53  KeeperOfTheSoul: though USB is better for me here since the external drive is for backup
20:53  evilbug: Branes: :) shooting everything down, eh? i've only had issue with consumer hdd's regarding esata. once i got a dedicated enclosure and hdd it's perfect.
20:53  b3ny0-: or they wanted to make more money on an adapter
20:53  b3ny0-: :P
20:54  KeeperOfTheSoul: how's esata a hack?

20:54  veronicamars: Wintel is a portmanteau of Windows and Intel. It usually refers to a computer system or the related ecosystem based on an Intel x86 compatible processor and running the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is sometimes used derisively to describe the monopolistic actions undertaken by both companies when attempting to dominate the market
20:54  veronicamars: oh yeah
20:54 +Branes: They'll never bother, they'll drop all of that for Light Peak in a couple of years, once they give Intel the heave-ho.
20:55 +Branes: Only two more years of int-hell, thank the gods.
20:55  veronicamars: just a reminder for all the ppc haters
20:55  evilbug: oh yeah, definitely looking forward to light peak.
20:55  veronicamars: Branes:  is Apple making their own cpu's ?
20:55 +Branes: Aye.
20:55  veronicamars: so they will ditch all intel?
20:56 +Branes: Parallel-processing multicore ARMs.
20:56  veronicamars: sweet
20:56 +Branes: Provided Steve doesn't die before the big switch, yes.
20:56  b3ny0-: not good for some
20:56  veronicamars: why not b3ny0- ?
20:57 +Branes: ben, a good POWER chip can emulate x86 code faster than *anything* Intel ships.
20:57  b3ny0-: there's a ton of software that relies on x86-64 architecture
20:57  veronicamars: so... ?
20:57  b3ny0-: provided it can run it at all
20:57  veronicamars: rosetta?
20:57  evilbug: rosetta. right...
20:57  veronicamars: i doubt it'll be able to run windows
20:58 +Branes: Other way, 'roni - Project Hammadi.
20:58  b3ny0-: windows isn't an issue, I was more thinking of DAWs and VST/AUs 
20:58  evilbug: b3ny0-: on you with that one.
20:58  veronicamars: Branes:  what is that i've never heard of it
20:58 +Branes: Does the reverse of Rosetta, provides x86 compatibility on RISC chips.
20:58  evilbug: with you on that one ** < fail.
20:59  veronicamars: oh ok
20:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: why did they switch to intel anyway?
21:00 +Branes: Two reasons: IBM wanted a long term contractual commitment on supply of the 'G6' Apple had designed, which Steve refused, and secondly PA Semi were behind schedule.
21:01  evilbug: Branes: didn't intel offer better performance at the time? and had the market with its c2d?
21:01 +Branes: So for the last five years, Steve has been milking the Intel-lover market building up a *huge* war-purse (US$58bn in the bank at the moment) so he can do _everything_ himself. Yes, he's that much of a control freak -- he wants to be beholden to no-one, not IBM, not Intel, no-one.
21:04  veronicamars: hehe
21:04 +Branes: bugsy, in terms of pure crunch, PowerPC still ran rings around Intel chips at the time, and even two years after the switch, a PowerMac G5 quad-core could out-compute a dual Xeon.
21:04  veronicamars: isn't it true PA Semi has the Power Architecture license?
21:04  veronicamars: so now Apple owns it
21:04 +Branes: Steve wanted money for his grand plan. What better way to do it than sucker in all the windows-weenies?
21:04  veronicamars: =]
21:04 +Branes: World's most epic bait-n-switch campaign ever :)
21:04  veronicamars: Steve is smart :)
21:04  veronicamars: ye
21:05  evilbug: Branes: but intels were more power-efficient, no?
21:06 +Branes: 'roni, Apple helped set PA Semi up. And they got some amazing smarts when they bought the company and rolled it into Hardware Engineering.
21:06  veronicamars: Branes:  i never believed Apple was going to stick with Intel indefinitely
21:06 +Branes: No, not at all, bugsy. Not in the slightest. Still aren't.
21:06  evilbug: Branes: nevermind then.
21:06  veronicamars: i remember how many macusers were outraged by the switch to intel
21:07  veronicamars: but now a lot of those people love their Intel Macs
21:07 +Branes: The ability to run Windows is a bug, not a feature :)
21:07  evilbug: Branes: +1
21:08  veronicamars: :)
21:09  evilbug: i don't know. i don't really care what they use as long as it's solid and my software works properly on it.
21:11  b3ny0-: I wasn't around those "golden days" of non-intel
21:12 +Branes: In a little over two years, all new Macs will run iOS Desktop, and you won't be able to boot any other OS.

21:13  evilbug: ios isn't suitable as a full desktop os, is it?

21:13  evilbug: so they'd have to do major overhaul.
21:13  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah, I hate websites forcing me to use a less secure password :(
21:14  evilbug: Branes: i don't know, jobs seems to want to take this whole thing a bit too far.

21:16 +Branes: I personally think he hasn't been taking it far enough.
21:16 +Branes: Considering almost everything he does is based around Kay's Three Laws.
21:16  evilbug: Branes: i'm just not sure about making it too closed. i understand it's ironic of me to say that since it's apple we're talking about but i think what we have now is good in terms of choices and all.
21:20  evilbug: Branes: and what laws are those?
21:22 +Branes: 1: Technology must strive to become invisible in the environment. 2: Teach computers how humans work. Never teach humans how computers work. 3: If you are serious about your software, you will make the hardware to run it.

21:24  evilbug: Branes: ah.
21:25  evilbug: i'm not sure about that second law. i saw irobot.
21:25  KeeperOfTheSoul: well new hdd on order, as this noise is starting to get annoying
21:26  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: what did you get?
21:27  evilbug: b3ny0-: what daw(s) do you run?
21:27  KeeperOfTheSoul: I went with http://www.ebuyer.com/product/200796
21:27  KeeperOfTheSoul: and http://www.ebuyer.com/product/200424
21:27  b3ny0-: ableton
21:29  evilbug: b3ny0-: hi5.
21:29  b3ny0-: hehe
21:29  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: nice, i like wd.
21:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: now all I got to do is find a size 0 screw driver
21:29  veovis_muaddib: evilbug: I don't like the second law either, it makes Skynet even harder to defeat...
21:30  imacake: hi
21:30  imacake: which Mac OS X does only use SSE/SSE2 ?
21:30  imacake: but nothing above like SSE3 ?
21:31  evilbug: veovis_muaddib: indeed.
21:31  KeeperOfTheSoul: although I've discovered the hdd is fine, the sound is coming from elsewhere
21:32  imacake: could i get an answer please ?
21:32 +Branes: None of them.
21:32  imacake: =[
21:33  fujisan: imacake 
21:33 --- ritsuka_ is now known as ritsuka
21:33 +Branes: It shouldn't be a problem anyway, all Intel-based Macs do SSE3
21:33  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: maybe open it up, peek inside.
21:34  KeeperOfTheSoul: evilbug: naw, its not from the laptop at all, its from elsewhere entirely
21:36  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: odd.
21:37  KeeperOfTheSoul: though in looking up prices for HDDs I realized I was tired of having only 120GB :)
21:37  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: i personally don't need that much internal space. i'm on 200gb now and only using about half.
21:37  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: most of my files are run from externals.
21:38  KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah, but I like to use iTunes to manage media, and that gets annoyed when the files arn't present
21:39  evilbug: wow, how much media do you have?
21:39  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: i mean i don't have uber amounts of music (and usually as 320 mp3) and videos i don't bother with.
21:40 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
21:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: evilbug: not huge huge amounts, but I do use VMs as well
21:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: and I do have movies and tv shows
21:44  KeeperOfTheSoul: and I like not having external HDDs plugged up and not having to worry about space or copy things to/from the main drive
21:45  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: gotcha. well i hope that your upgrade will be enough for a while.
21:45  KeeperOfTheSoul: should be, might partition it in 2 and use the other half for time machine
21:47  evilbug: you should have enough room for that :)
21:48  veovis_muaddib: KeeperOfTheSoul: You HAVE to name your time machine partition TARDIS...
21:48  evilbug: KeeperOfTheSoul: i'm off. take care.
21:48  veovis_muaddib: It's an unspoken rule :P
21:48  KeeperOfTheSoul: didn't you just speak it?
21:49  veovis_muaddib: Yeah
21:49  evilbug: type it **
21:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: I wonder if superduper can back up a timemachine partition to another drive

22:09  imacake: KeeperOfTheSoul, i can
22:12  KeeperOfTheSoul: excellent
22:16  fujisan: KeeperOfTheSoul:  externals are great what are you talking about?
22:17  KeeperOfTheSoul: fujisan: what do you mean?
22:17  fujisan: @rewind member:identifier:keeperofthesoul:
22:17  fujisan: and I like not having external HDDs plugged up and not having to worry about space or copy things to/from the main drive
22:18  fujisan: KeeperOfTheSoul:  eventually you'll need more space
22:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: right, if you have an external drive plugged up it gets annoying, since you can't just pickup your laptop and walk around with it anymore, it's tethered to the external drive
22:18  fujisan: and then you have choice but to use externals
22:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: and you get the annoying problem you can't just unplug the external drive as it is in use
22:18  fujisan: oh i thought you were talking about a desktop mac nvm
22:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: nawp
22:20  fujisan: i use my external for timemachine mainly
22:20  KeeperOfTheSoul: I would do that if I could have time-machine use 2 sources
22:21  fujisan: oh ok
22:21  KeeperOfTheSoul: I want it to use a local partition so that I can get the short changes archived
22:21  KeeperOfTheSoul: but also need external for actual backup

22:23  veovis_muaddib: Already have flac copies of all of my music, and isos and converted mkvs of all my movies, all sitting on my server...

22:24  veovis_muaddib: Yes, yes I do

22:25  veovis_muaddib: But here's the question:  Do you know veovis?
22:25  fujisan: no not really :O
22:25  veovis_muaddib: fujisan: He's from the Myst novels, which don't seem to have been that popular...
22:25  fujisan: oh ok
22:26  fujisan: never read those
22:26  veovis_muaddib: fujisan: They
22:26  fujisan: Live?
22:26  veovis_muaddib: They're making a movie about one, so you could see that
22:26  fujisan: oh ok
22:26  fujisan: cool
22:26  veovis_muaddib: Hit enter on accident
22:26  fujisan: they are also making a movie about neuromancer
22:26  veovis_muaddib: hmmm
22:26  fujisan: =]
22:27  fujisan: it's a cyberpunk William Gibson novel
22:27  veovis_muaddib: Yeah
22:27  veovis_muaddib: That's pretty cool, I'll keep an eye on that
22:28  fujisan: i have some of his books i got some 2nd hand also but the book just makes me sneeze nonstop

22:33  SJr: It honours the Queens first boxing match on December 26th 1959 after her coronation.
22:34  fujisan: some UK thing then?
22:34  SJr: But also Canadian
22:34  SJr: and Australian
22:34  fujisan: Common Wealth thing then
22:34  SJr: and if the King of england has his way, the thirteen colonies will partake in it soon.

22:36  neuro: "they"'ve been making a neuromancer movie for about 20 years now
22:36  fujisan: neuro hehe
22:36  fujisan: so it's another Ubik then :(
22:37  neuro: i'll believe it when i see it
22:37  neuro: that too
22:37  fujisan: :)
22:37  neuro: i have a seriously well thumbed copy of neuromancer, signed by the man himself
22:37  veovis_muaddib: You just don't want us to talk about it so you don't get highlighted randomly...  :P

22:40  neuro: i want a trailer on trailers.apple.com and a rock solid release date
22:41  fujisan: ye
22:41  fujisan: i still hope Ubik will be turned into a movie as well
22:42  fujisan: Dick had an idea for the film which involved "the film itself appearing to undergo a series of reversions: to black-and-white, then to the awkward jerkiness of very early movies, then to a crookedly jammed frame which proceeds to blacken, bubble and melt away, leaving only the white glare of the projection bulb, which in turn deteriorates to leave the theater in darkness, and might almost leave the moviegoer wondering what sort of dilapidate

23:24  [M]ax: imacake topic
23:24  imacake: my computer only has SSE/SSE2
23:25 @ChrisAM: imacake ... which mac do you have?
23:25  imacake: I'd like to know if i can install mac anyway on it
23:25  imacake: i have a toshiba laptop
23:25  imacake: just want to know if i can install mac on it
23:25 @ChrisAM: We don't support installing OS X on non-apple hardware.
23:25  Marctraider: this is hackintosh
23:25  imacake: o.O
23:26  imacake: why wont it work on any other computer ?
23:26 @ChrisAM: It violates the license agreement.
23:26  Marctraider: But to answer your question, it theoretically means that if the apps /kernel were compiled wih sse3 it could possible not work for you :p
23:26  imacake: oh
23:26  imacake: :(
23:26  Marctraider: it would execute unknown code
23:26  Marctraider: But since you talk about a toshiba it is hackintosh
23:27  imacake: btw. in these stores where there are mac laptops...
23:28  imacake: there isnt any command like New File in the popup menu ???
23:28  Detergentizer: Hi!
23:28  imacake: i have to use terminal for that all time ?
23:28  Marctraider: ?
23:28  Detergentizer: wut is best (but FREE) dvd ripper around today?
23:28  imacake: Detergentizer, dd
23:29  imacake: i dont know if Mac support it. but its built in into linux
23:29 @ChrisAM: Detergentizer ... Handbrake, imo.
23:29  Marctraider: imacake: Well, or just open up the program which you want the file to be, and save it.
23:29  imacake: Marctraider, huh
23:29  Marctraider: Or I dont know what you mean
23:30  imacake: in the file manager popup menu. there is only new folder
23:30  Marctraider: Ok ..
23:30  Marctraider: So i get you correctly. and indeed there is no such thing as new file afaik
23:30  Marctraider: what file do you want to create?
23:31  imacake: text files, cpp files, links, folders, binary files, just everything
23:31 @ChrisAM: there is nothing like Windows' Right-click -> New -> Document Type
23:31  Marctraider: if you want to create a textfile just open a text editor and save the file.
23:31  imacake: ChrisAM, ima linux geek
23:31  veovis_muaddib: ChrisAM: Terminal > $ touch FILE
23:31 @ChrisAM: there are some 3rd party hacks to add it to the context menu.
23:31  Marctraider: imacake: most of these files gets saved by their specific program anyway
23:31  Detergentizer: ok.
23:32  Marctraider: And if you want an empty file, do what veovis told you
23:32  Detergentizer: I will downloadies handbreak
23:32  imacake: i know touch...
23:32  Marctraider: ok
23:32  imacake: btw, can any of you mac users check if you have installed "dd" ?
23:32  imacake: (terminal)
23:32  Detergentizer: dd?
23:33  Marctraider: imacake confirmed.
23:33  Detergentizer: damn disk?
23:33  imacake: Detergentizer, yes lol
23:33  imacake: cool
23:33  Marctraider: Its installed.
23:33  imacake: Detergentizer, to rip your DVD
23:33  Detergentizer: handbreak costs money though
23:33  imacake: you just type:
23:33  imacake: dont buy it!
23:33  imacake: whats the DVD device name ?
23:33  Marctraider: detergentizer: why dont you try it first, if you like it, buy it.
23:33  imacake: i mean, /dev/cdrom ?
23:34  Detergentizer: wut is the url maybez i gots the wrong wone?
23:34  Marctraider: imacake: i think /dev/disk*
23:35  Marctraider: Because there is no /dev/cdrom, nor /dev/hd*
23:35  imacake: no, /dev/disk should be the HDD
23:35  Marctraider: or sd*
23:35 @ChrisAM: the site is handbrake.fr but it's not loading for me right now
23:35  Marctraider: imacake: you dont know that for sure.
23:35  imacake: on linux its /dev/cdromN
23:35  Marctraider: imacake: because hd* also stands for 'harddisk' i assume, but hda could just as well be cdrom.
23:35  Marctraider: not neccesarily.
23:35  imacake: no
23:35  imacake: theres hdX and sdX
23:35  Marctraider: my cdrom is /dev/hdd
23:36  Marctraider: so what you say is not entirely correct :p
23:36  imacake: hdX is used on IDE stuff, sdX on SCSI stuff
23:36  Marctraider: I know.
23:36  imacake: anyway
23:36  imacake: Detergentizer:
23:36  Marctraider: And cdrom = IDE/ATAPI as well, unless we talk about SATA
23:36  bassliner: imacake: even that is not necessarily true as ide drives get mapped to scsi todays.
23:37  imacake: dd if=/dev/hdd of=somefile bs=65536
23:37  Marctraider: imacake: http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie4_2_2.htm
23:37  imacake: that'll copy every byte to somefile
23:37  Marctraider: sorry ;)
23:37  Marctraider: /dev/cdrom is just a 'shortcut'
23:37  veovis_muaddib:  imacake: My 2008 MBP was (before it broke) packing an IDE optical
23:37  Marctraider: to the real device node
23:38  bassliner: well libata maintains ide drives too since a specific kernel version many years ago.
23:38  veovis_muaddib: The optical broke, not the MBP
23:38  imacake: okay, thanks

23:39  Detergentizer: yeah ya
23:39  imacake: dd if=/dev/hdd of=somefile bs=65536
23:40  imacake: to copy your DVD
23:40  Detergentizer: will i be able to play it?
23:40  Detergentizer: it is dvd of movie
23:40  imacake: yes
23:40  imacake: you just mount it as a disk on some loop thing
23:40  Detergentizer: k
23:40  Detergentizer: me tryzies
23:40  Marctraider: :
23:40  Marctraider: :o
23:41  Marctraider: Detergentizer: why dont you just copy over all data in VIDEO_TS?
23:41  imacake: please note the copy thing will take long and it doesnt give output. give it time
23:41  Marctraider: you can play it from your harddisk as well
23:41  Detergentizer: OK'zies
23:41  veovis_muaddib: Detergentizer: imacake: Run it in screen -dmS DD
23:41  imacake: huh
23:41  Marctraider: unless you want to explicitly have a one on one copy, but that would mean you;d have to find a way to 'mount' the file
23:42  diffract|: what is the significance of the number 65536?
23:42  Detergentizer: I'm off to the liubrary then to copy dvd's thankies for help!
23:42  Marctraider: isnt bs blocksize?
23:42  imacake: yes
23:43  imacake: set a higher blocksize if you have more RAM
23:43  imacake: should be faster...
23:43  Detergentizer: i'm gonna sit there and copy every movie in the library
23:43  diffract|: why do you have to set the block size? this number is hard to remember, this is a horrible interface
23:43  imacake: (gparted detects always 65536 as fastest over here)
23:43  imacake: Detergentizer, okay
23:44  Detergentizer: byte bytes
23:44  imacake: you can simply mount them, and they appear as normal disks
23:44  imacake: (kernel provides that. not any app.)
23:44  imacake: btw. how is software under mac managed ?
23:45  imacake: packets like linux ?
23:45  Marctraider: it copies the .app to the applications directory really.
23:45  Detergentizer: does library allow mounting in public place?
23:45  Marctraider: and additional files go to libraries and other locations.
23:45  diffract|: what do you mean managed?
23:45  Marctraider: I think he means package manager like linux distros
23:46  imacake: Detergentizer, the "mount" command allows you to mount any file to any location. even in some folder on your desktop
23:46  Detergentizer: imacake: quikie quest, the library has 300 dvd movies canI copy in 8 hours?
23:46  Marctraider: lol
23:46  imacake: Detergentizer, OMG
23:46  Detergentizer: ?
23:46  imacake: depending on your computer speed....
23:46  imacake: 300DVDs
23:46  imacake: 4.7 GB
23:47  diffract|: you never know until you start copying
23:47  imacake: i needed like 15 mins for a 2GB microSD card
23:47  Marctraider: approx 1.5TB
23:47  Detergentizer: I have mac laptop 3 external terabyte disks
23:47  Marctraider: 1410GB
23:48  Marctraider: Calculate how fast your reads are, and calculate it over all DVD's. And all the time you need to put all dvd's in your drive in and out.
23:48  imacake: yes
23:48  Marctraider: Assuming you will stay with the computer all the time, not falling asleep
23:48  imacake: if you have a multicore CPU, start multiplie copythings...
23:48  Marctraider: But I thought i heard some lego device which could automatically switch cd/dvd's from your drive ;)
23:49  Detergentizer: they have conference room, I reserved it for 3 days
23:49  imacake: heh
23:49  Detergentizer: I will start many copies and go home and come back at closing
23:49  imacake: but wait
23:49  Detergentizer: just wanted to know how many I should start and expext to be done in 8 hours
23:49  imacake: you must save each on an different disk
23:50  imacake: reading from a different CD drive
23:50  Detergentizer: I have 3 external usb drivers
23:50  imacake: else speed will decrease instead of increase
23:50  Detergentizer: oh.
23:50  Marctraider: seektimes
23:50  Detergentizer: that's right I only gots 1 dvd
23:50  Detergentizer: hehehe.
23:50  imacake: then it doesnt matter much
23:50  imacake: you still have to exchange the DVDs yourself
23:50  Detergentizer: yeah...
23:51  imacake: then just execute the command again. repeat 300 times
23:51  imacake: o.o
23:51  Detergentizer: soI assume it will take 45minutes per copy 
23:51  Detergentizer: my fried and I will do watch
23:51  Detergentizer: I take fist 4 hours and he second
23:51  Detergentizer: hehehe
23:52  Marctraider: 45minutes per copy? how slow of a dvd drive do you have?
23:52  Detergentizer: really?
23:52  Detergentizer: maybe it will be faster then!
23:52  Detergentizer: :D
23:52  Marctraider: omg...
23:52  Detergentizer: we are startiung our own online video store
23:52  Marctraider: i see...
23:52  imacake: good luck with it
23:52  imacake: but use linux as server, not mac please
23:53  Detergentizer: we got the idea in school last week.
23:53  Detergentizer: and we gonna do it check
23:53  Detergentizer: you can rent the movies for only 99cents if you pay $100.0 to register!
23:53  imacake: o.O
23:53  iSpacewalker: (afaik it's illegal...)
