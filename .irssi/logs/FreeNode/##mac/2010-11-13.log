00:24  MariusAZ: It's a good show, kinda campy though
00:24  alexlea: i wonder if weedsis any good...i have yet to see an ep

00:25  MariusAZ: I heard Breaking Bad was good, I haven't seen it yet though
00:26  alexlea: MariusAZ: you should totally get Boardwalk Empire
00:26  alexlea: it's one of those shows that i think almost anyone can like
00:26  alexlea: its just super good

00:53  MariusAZ: Peter
00:55  alexlea: tehbaut: a discount coupon? that is the LAMEST euphamism i have ever heard
00:55  tehbaut: I know, right?
00:55  alexlea: lol
00:56  MariusAZ: I don't even know what TotalFinder is
00:56  tehbaut: it's technically a discount link with coupon code tagged on, apparently there's no form field to enter a coupon code on the order screen
00:56  MariusAZ: Sounds like some kind of kickback affiliate thing
00:56  MariusAZ: And a lame attempt at advertising
00:56  tehbaut: serioiusly? It's only the most awesome Finder utility ever
00:57  MariusAZ: point proven
00:57  MariusAZ: How much are they paying you?
00:57  alexlea: i tried total finder...i HATED it
00:57  MariusAZ: Or did you write it?
00:57  alexlea: you cant turn tabs off
00:57  alexlea: LAME LAME LAME
00:57  alexlea: only thing i liked was being able to have folders on top
00:57  tehbaut: yeah, that's what drew me to it
00:58  tehbaut: and no, there's no affiliate system unfortunately

01:12  Citrus: My Mac Pro wont boot up. I am getting this red LED on my motherboard: http://imgur.com/oTPtJ.jpg how can I fix it?
01:12  MariusAZ: Citrus:  We already told you, take it to the Genius Bar
01:12  Citrus: im out of warranty
01:12  MariusAZ: Citrus:  Worst case scenario, they'll have to do a depot repair on it which costs about $300
01:13  Citrus: thats what I am trying to avoid
01:13  Citrus: I cant afford that
01:13  MariusAZ: Well, you don't have much of a choice
01:13  Citrus: I want to try and fix it on m own
01:13  MariusAZ: You can try and find parts online for it, if it's a temp sensor, buy a new one and replace it, if it's the CPU, replace it, if it's the motherboard, umm, that's more expensive than Genius Bar
01:14  MariusAZ: Thing of it is, you're gonna have to spend money to fix it
01:14  Citrus: what if the temp sensor is loose
01:14  Citrus: or i just need to use fresh thermal paste for the heatsinks
01:15  MariusAZ: You get a light immediately when you turn it on?
01:15  MariusAZ: Even if it's been powered off for a while?
01:15  MariusAZ: If so, that's not a temperature problem
01:15  MariusAZ: That's a faulty part problem
01:19  MariusAZ: You've got sensors going off on both CPUA and CPUB, the chances of both sockets failing at the same time are slim to none
01:19  MariusAZ: I would assume you've got a logic board problem
01:19  MariusAZ: And a new Mac Pro logic board runs about $800
01:20  MariusAZ: A depot repair at the Genius Bar is about $300
01:20  MariusAZ: And they'll replace the logic board if it's faulty

16:25  Cam: Nope, didn't work
16:25  Cam: http://cl.ly/1o262t0i2A1L403H0N2p

16:34  Cam: Jarvis; Didn't work.
16:34  Cam: ChrisAM; What was it?
16:34 @ChrisAM: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5172108142_32c486140d_o.png
16:34  Jarvis: Cam: it puts the screenshot in your Documents/ScreenShots directory
16:35  Cam: Jarvis; I took a picture when it was blue and I couldn't see my screen but it took a pic of the screen.
16:35  Jarvis: did u hit space?
16:35  Jarvis: so u got a camera icon
16:35  Cam: Nah, cmd+shift+3
16:35 @ChrisAM: I did cmd+shift+3
16:35  Cam: Humph.
16:35  Jarvis: ah i use 4
16:36  Jarvis: i wasn't aware 3 worked :/

16:39  Cam: R: 20.8% G: 40.4% B:69.4%
16:39  Marctraider: You didnt use the solid colors from wallpaper section did you? because I dont talk about that color
16:39  Marctraider: ohhh.. ok :)
16:40  Marctraider: thank you all :)
16:40 @ChrisAM: when it does the blue screen during the video switch, it replaces your existing desktop background with the blue one when you take the screenshot
16:40  Cam: Want the hex val?
16:40  Cam: ChrisAM; It does? :o
16:40  Cam: Hex 8-bit: 53.103.177

16:42  Marctraider: im trying this cmd shift 3 myself just to get the hang of it :p
16:42 @ChrisAM: move to a space that has no windows up, otherwise it might cover the background when you take the screenshit
16:42 @ChrisAM: err shot

16:43  Marctraider: is there some paint proggie?
16:43  Marctraider: where you should paste the screenie?
16:44 @ChrisAM: Screenshots go to my desktop when I take them.
16:44  Cam: tinypic.com imgur.com
16:44 @ChrisAM: cmd+shift+3 goes to a file, not the clipboard
16:44  Marctraider: oh it does it automatically
16:44  Marctraider: okie
16:44  Cam: I have an auto-uploader for me.
16:44 @ChrisAM: I use DropZone to send them to my Flickr account.
16:44  Marctraider: it drops them at the desktop here :/
16:45  mike3: guys, what are the benefits of running osx under a windows domain?
16:45 @ChrisAM: unified account management
16:46  Marctraider: chrisAM, cam: i managed to screen it as well ;)
16:46  mike3: other then that?
16:46 @ChrisAM: did it show you the color?
16:46  Marctraider: yup
16:46 @ChrisAM: cool
16:46  Marctraider: and only the color :)
16:46 @ChrisAM: mike3 ... I've never done it myself.
16:46  Marctraider: so i dont have to manually create the wallpaper
16:47  Marctraider: chrisAM: I dont know why mac didnt put this color for a solid color background because i think this looks the best.
16:47 @ChrisAM: I use images as backgrounds
16:48  Cam: MY background > all others.
16:48 @ChrisAM: picked one from here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/01/desktop-wallpaper-calendar-november-2010/

16:49  Marctraider: Did you guys also calibrate your screens to be a little less yellowish?
16:49  Cam: Nope
16:50 @ChrisAM: I don't notice yellow on mine.
16:50  Cam: red white and black ftw
16:51  Marctraider: Ic well with my new macbook pro I noticed some yellowish part, ONLY after i calibrated my screen with the expert settings though
16:51  Marctraider: because now i see the difference
16:52  Marctraider: The normal Aqua blue wallpaper (brushed) looked slightly yellowish instead of blue :/
16:52  Marctraider: I didnt thought it was right.
16:53  Cam: Time to go to school, ttyl
16:53  Marctraider: seeya dude :)

16:55  Marctraider: oic.
16:55  Marctraider: yup
16:59  anr78: I've made an apple script to launch movies with mplayer from a shell. It works, but when I try to set it as default application for avi/wmv files, OS X won't listen. It chooses Quicktime instead.. 
16:59 @ChrisAM: could you put it into an automator application and try it that way?
17:01  anr78: ChrisAM: was that for me? I have never used automator, so I don't understand if your answer is relevant for my Q :)
17:01 @ChrisAM: yes
17:01 @ChrisAM: automator will bundle the script up as an app
17:02  anr78: ChrisAM: I have saved the script as an app from applescript editor, does that give the same result?
17:02 @ChrisAM: not sure
17:02 @ChrisAM: are you hitting "Change All" when you set the default app?
17:04  anr78: ChrisAM: yes. I'm able to choose my App for one file, but when I hit change all, the scrolldown menu changes to quicktime.
17:04 @ChrisAM: weird
17:10  dpecka: hi thre

17:15  dpecka: ChrisAM: what's the proper english name for such a kind of software?
17:15 @ChrisAM: not sure, but handwriting recognition might be good
17:15  dpecka: is it "gesture recognition" ?
17:16  dpecka: ok, thanks ... hard to find sometning .. i'm not native speaker so i'm using probably bad terms

18:12  MikeH_: Hi guys, I'm looking for something free for mac that can batch convert mov's to mp4/x264
18:13  MikeH_: ffmpegx works great, but no batch option
18:13  crilly: A Python script
18:13  crilly: written by you, would be free and gain you invaluable knowledge
18:13  MikeH_: I'd rather not, else I'd have already done that
18:14  MikeH_: The girlfriend needs to be able to use it, too.
