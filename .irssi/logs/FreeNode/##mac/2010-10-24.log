00:01  apsuva: 64bit hd5870 driver available ?
00:02  crilly: Why do you need a driver?
00:02  fleebailey33: ?
00:02  crilly: WHat is the device?
00:02  apsuva: my screen resolution 1024x768. i have ati 5870
00:02  fleebailey33: apsuva: what mac do you have
00:02  apsuva: ooppss
00:03  apsuva: sorryy
00:03  apsuva: i have hackintosh :D
00:03  apsuva: sorry
00:03  crilly: we can't help with that sorry
00:04  crilly: i'm sure fleebailey33 can in private - he's quite the hackintosher.
00:04  apsuva: ok i understand. i see topic :)
00:04  fleebailey33: lies
00:04  fleebailey33: all lies
00:04  fleebailey33: :P
00:04  fleebailey33: apsuva: irc.osx86.hu #radeonhd
00:04  fleebailey33: but dont ask me
00:05  apsuva: ok thanks. i had a macbook pro and sold :)
00:07 <-- bashusr has kicked fleebailey33 from ##mac (PM that stuff)
00:07  crilly: oh you're here
00:08 @bashusr: haha
00:08 @bashusr: hfor 5 seconds
00:08 @bashusr: i'm going to a weddin g banquet
00:08 @bashusr: in 5 seconds
00:08 @bashusr: what's up?
00:08 @bashusr: you IMed me this mroning?
00:08  ChrisAM: bashusr ... you gettin married?
00:08  crilly: bashusr: richard is good to go
00:08 @bashusr: no
00:08 @bashusr: ok coool
00:08 @bashusr: he's not going to be a tyrant?
00:08 @bashusr: he's a cool guy?
00:08  crilly: Nah he seems very laid back
00:08  crilly: like a true australian
00:09 @bashusr: haha
00:09 @bashusr: ok
00:09  crilly: Oh he's online actually
00:09  crilly: richardcavell: hi
00:10  crilly: hmm 11 days uptime. i'm debating whether or not to shutdown tonight.
00:10 @bashusr: crilly: ok
00:10 @bashusr: haha
00:10 @bashusr: that's nothing
00:12  crilly: bashusr: i've had an uptime of four years on a Linux server.
00:13 @bashusr: nice!!!
00:13 * bashusr looks for exploits 
00:13  ChrisAM: running a 4 year old kernel... great
00:13 @bashusr: from the last 3 years
00:13 @bashusr: to run on crilly 
00:14  crilly: It wasn't connected to the Internet.
00:14  crilly: It wasn't even connected to the LAN after about a year.
00:14  crilly: I disconnected it by mistake and because it was in the loft and not actually serving like a server should, it was forgotten about.
00:15  crilly: If I could, I would have my entire network infrastructure (all one of my router and cable modem) in the loft. I use WiFi for every device in the house.
00:15  crilly: Although I don't want to create a much more complex network for experimenting and playing around
00:15  ChrisAM: I only use wifi for the Nook... everything else is wired.
00:17  crilly: Nook?
00:17 @bashusr: crilly: huh?
00:17 @bashusr: so what's the point?
00:18 @bashusr: no internet connection
00:18 @bashusr: not working like  a server
00:18 @bashusr: what was it doing??
00:18 @bashusr: nothing?
00:18  ChrisAM: crilly ... Barnes & Noble's answer to the Kindle.
00:20  crilly: bashusr: I forgot about it. I unplugged the cat5, not knowing what it was for, and plugged something else in. that was that. it sat there happily for three years. the power grid in the UK is very stable. it's especially stable around here because in clear view of my house are eight hugh cooling towers sitting along side a power station :)
00:20 @bashusr: crilly: lol
00:21 @bashusr: aww
00:21 @bashusr: so it wasn't put to the test!
00:21 @bashusr: time to go to the banquet
00:21 @bashusr: ttyl
00:21  crilly: it wasn't :(
00:21 @bashusr: crilly: don't get cancer
00:21  crilly: have a good night mate.
00:21  crilly: it's a coal powered plant :P
00:21 @bashusr: yeah
00:21 @bashusr: don't get cancer
00:21 @bashusr: =P
00:21  crilly: thanks
00:21 @bashusr: if the magnetic waves don't get you
00:21 @bashusr: the smog will =P
00:22  crilly: don't you live in a dense American city? lol
00:22  crilly: do you even have grass where you live? :P
00:22  crilly: richardcavell: oi poo head
00:26  richardcavell: hello
00:26  richardcavell: I was busy downloading Half-Life 2 on Steam.  My apologies
00:27  crilly: no need to apologise :P
00:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +o richardcavell]
00:27 @richardcavell: it works
00:28 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac -o richardcavell]
00:28  crilly: Welcome on board. Enjoy and play nicely :)
00:28  crilly: The zombie shift is yours ;)
00:29  richardcavell: I will quote from China's first astronaut, Yang Liwei
00:30  richardcavell: I will not disappoint the motherland. I will complete each movement with total concentration. And I will gain honor for the People's Liberation Army and for the Chinese nation.
00:32  crilly: so you're saying you're a communist? ;P
00:32  crilly: and everytihn you do is for CHina!
00:32  richardcavell: haha no, I just thought it was a funny quote
00:33  crilly: :P
00:33  crilly: I need a new client. Macirssi isn't very... Mac like
00:34  ChrisAM: Textual
00:36  richardcavell: I like Colloquy
00:36  richardcavell: although it is kind of simple
00:37  crilly: ChrisAM: Looks simple. I shall give it a try.
00:38  mrcrilly: OK well, I can't read any text, so that's a negative point.
00:38  crilly: ChrisAM: http://cl.ly/49528e1505c43020b814
00:39  ChrisAM: that happened to me once... a restart of the app fixed it
00:39  mrcrilly: ChanServYes, that did indeed fix it. I suppose that can be forgiven for now; it is beta still isn't it?
00:40  mrcrilly: ChanServ?
00:40  mrcrilly: ChrisAM*
00:40 --- mrcrilly is now known as crilly
00:40  ChrisAM: it's a 1.x release
00:40  crilly: aye
00:40  ChrisAM: mikemac11 is the developer... he's in here every now and then
00:41  crilly: i see. i assume it's written in ObjC + Cocoa?
00:42  ChrisAM: I guess... im no programmer
00:42  ChrisAM: http://github.com/mikemac11/Textual
00:44  crilly: ChrisAM, how is your networking? I've been trying to get a better understanding of how FaceTime works. The only aspect I don't understand is the whole NAT traversal
00:46  KeeperOfTheSoul: crilly: doesn't it just use stun?
00:46  crilly: KeeperOfTheSoul; it does, as well as TURN and ICE too.
00:46  KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah, quite comprehensive
00:46  crilly: I'm wondering if uPNP comes in to it as well?
00:47  ChrisAM: you don't need NAT to use facetime
00:48  crilly: Because once it has bounced off a STUN server and discovered it's behind NAT, it will get TURN to get a proxy to use basically (worst case). The part I don't understand is how ICE then discovers the best path and whether or not both can be connected directly.
00:48  crilly: Will ICE try and use uPNP on the router to setup port forwarding?
00:48  crilly: ChrisAM: I know.
00:48  ChrisAM: I haven't looked at any packet captures of it yet.
00:50  panosru: Hello
00:50  panosru: you think it would be good idea if I back up my mac and re-format the disk to respect case sensitivity ?
00:51  crilly: You mean set the filesystem to be case-sensituve?
00:51  S_SubZero: no
00:51  panosru: yes
00:51  crilly: I can't see why you would want to do that. I can't imagine it's a good idea, in fact.
00:51  diffract|: why is deprecating the java vm making a big fuss? we'll just get subsequent versions from oracle
00:52  crilly: diffract| sorry what?
00:52  panosru: its real pain if you are web developer because in big projects you may miss some times something and when you deploy the project on a linux server that respect case sensitivity you have issues trying to find where you had the case-insensitive mistake
00:52  diffract|: crilly: what did you find unclear?
00:53  panosru: my previous macbook was case sensitive and it seems to work fine
00:54  panosru: I'm just not sure if I format now my drive to respect case sensitivity if some of my apps fail or do crazy things
00:54  crilly: panosru, quite possibly.
00:54  crilly: diffract|, i found what you're talking about unclear as a whole.
00:54  S_SubZero: you gain nothing from using case-sensitive.  You potentially introduce problems by using case-sensitive.
00:54  diffract|: crilly: apple deprecated java
00:55  diffract|: it's making a big fuss
00:55  diffract|: i don't know why
00:55  diffract|: because we'll just get subsequent versions from oracle
00:55  crilly: I'm afraid I can't explain Apple's thinking on that one.
00:56  crilly: ChrisAM, nice client, but the tabbing of nicknames is annoying; i want it to auto post-append ': ' after the nick :P
00:56  crilly: ChrisAM, and yes it's ObjC + Cocoa I think

01:24  thelostpatrol: S60 only, btw
01:24  thelostpatrol: screw that newfangled one they just came out with!

01:26  thelostpatrol: this song is about the apple store
01:28  richardcavell: Everyone, let's make a list of must-have Mac software.  Software that any user should have.  I'll start: Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, Firefox/Chrome, Carbon Copy Cloner, 1Password, iDefrag, Onyx, Skype, VLC
01:29  S_SubZero: I don't have seven of those things but my Mac is still doing what I need it to do.
01:29  S_SubZero: Whatever does this mean?
01:29  richardcavell: well what's your must-have list?
01:30  S_SubZero: Power button?

01:31 * crilly is currently running: Finder, Google Chrome, Mail, Skype, Textual, Xcode, QuickTime Player - (7 Total)
01:31  crilly: pretty much them
01:37  thelostpatrol: richardcavell, adobe reader? why?
01:37  thelostpatrol: completely useless
01:37  thelostpatrol: same with idefrag--not necessary
01:38  thelostpatrol: ff/chrome not necessary either
01:38  richardcavell: I think that iDefrag makes a significant difference to my drive performance
01:39  crilly: i might that a try
01:39  koro: doesn't mac os defrag automatically
01:39  koro: or something
01:39  spline: iterm2, chromium
01:40  spline: hm what else do I use
01:40  Tomis: files under 30MB koro 
01:40  crilly: koro: the file system does yes
01:40  spline: because OSX has minimal fragmentation
01:40  spline: here
01:40  S_SubZero: oh yeah, my work upgraded their Exchange server and I can get to it with the 10.6 Mail/iCal/Contacts.  Not sure I want this tho -.-;
01:40  richardcavell: theoretically it does do some defragging but it's very limited
01:40  thelostpatrol: my list: perian, vlc, skype, linkinus or other irc client, transmission, adblock for safari, vlc, appcleaner, soundsource menubar app (lets you choose sound in/outs from the bar), ccc.
01:40  crilly: any journalling filesystem does
01:40  koro: whaaat? why would files over 30MB be fragmented anyway
01:40  spline: all you need to know about HFS frag: http://www.osxbook.com/software/hfsdebug/fragmentation.html
01:40  spline: best article ever
01:40  Tomis: why would any file be fragmented
01:40  spline: read that
01:40  spline: Amit = brilliant
01:40  koro: ok
01:41  Tomis: anyway, the OS takes care of ir
01:41  Tomis: if the systme needed to be defragged, apple would include a defragger and run it automatically
01:41  thelostpatrol: yep
01:41  spline: yes
01:41  thelostpatrol: as microsoft does with windows
01:41  spline: well I don't think hfs fragments in the first place.. or it heals itself 
01:41  spline: (don't know all too much about it)
01:42  spline: im not sure I saw the purpose of idefrag beyond using it for fat32
01:43  crilly: iDefrag is a bit pricey
01:43  spline: that too
01:43  richardcavell: iDefrag really improves the speed of my drives
01:43  Tomis: it's like $80 isn't it?
01:43  crilly: £25
01:44  spline: hm don't you also not defrag on SSD? because of how it  does the blocks?
01:44  Tomis: oh, so like $300 american then crilly 
01:44  spline: I already run w/o aTime when mounting 
01:44  richardcavell: And I also run it on my backups simply to force the files to be rewritten so that they're freshly laid on the disk
01:44  crilly: Tomis: I wish
01:44  crilly: I would be minted if i went the US
01:45  richardcavell: spline: yeah defragging an SSD makes no improvement and wears out the drive
01:45  spline: yeah
01:45  spline: well the one thing I wish would come is 1) apple still lacks TRIM support
01:45  spline: 2) Specific ssd options since they offer the drives
01:45  spline: 3) the way to check the "wear" is done via SMART, same way as normal drives
01:45  spline: however, it has a different attributes table (modify the offset) to get them
01:46  spline: im not thinking what else should be done on OSX or any unix machine for ssd, though
01:46  crilly: richardcavell: Is this good or bad? http://cl.ly/295a136f14c425f50b45
01:46  richardcavell: whoa!
01:47  crilly: looks bad to me. all that red
01:47  richardcavell: If you defrag that hard disk, it will work faster.  You'll also gain some free space that's currently consumed with fragmentation
01:47  crilly: i can't afford the £25 they're asking for iDefrag
01:47  richardcavell: the very first time you boot after a defrag, it takes about 5 seconds extra - there's some reason for that - but after that, it's faster
01:48  richardcavell: connect it to my computer via VPN and I'll defrag it from here
01:48  spline: what about just using amit's hfsdebug until in the console?
01:49  richardcavell: hfsdebug doesn't defrag
01:49 --- Julian-_ is now known as tos9_
01:50  crilly: it would be nice if they let you defrag at least once in the demo
01:50  richardcavell: don't they let you defrag as long as the volume is < 250 megs?
01:50  spline: hm any way to get the frag % w/o idefrag?
01:51  richardcavell: spline: yeah hfsdebug will report fragmentation but not defrag
01:51  richardcavell: seriously spend the 25 quid
01:53  richardcavell: what I find intriguing is that there's no defragger for the Linux filesystem (ext)
01:53  richardcavell: out of all the tens of thousands of FOSS projects, no one's made a defragger
01:55  proprietarysucks: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=712384
01:56  proprietarysucks: it doesn't need a defragger
01:56  spline: yeah I was unaware even ext3/4 needed it
01:56  proprietarysucks: what I find intriguing is that there are still filesystems that need that =]
01:59  richardcavell: as SSDs become more common, fragmentation and defragging will become history
02:00  crilly: they need to become a lot cheaper and hold longer lives
02:02  richardcavell: All this talk of defragging has made me want to fire up iDefrag on my boot disk
02:03  richardcavell: ok that's it I can't help myself.  Logging out to defrag now...
02:03  crilly: lol

02:39  mattsh: hi everyone! does anyone have any tips on the best 2x4GB RAM upgrade for a 2010 unibody Mac Mini?
02:40  Tomis: whatever is cheep and meets the specs
02:40  portnoy: Or tips on a mini displayport to hdmi cable that carries audio for a new macbook pro?
02:40  Tomis: i usually just go to newegg and amazon matthew- 
02:40  Tomis: err mattsh rather
02:41  mattsh: @Tomis is there no performance difference between Crucial, Corsair, Kingston, and OWC?
02:41  mattsh: @Tomis The name is actually matthew :) good guess
02:41  Tomis: any cable should do portnoy 
02:41  mattsh: how can you be sure which are compatible with the Mac Mini?
02:41  Tomis: it's the hardware/software in the machine which couldn't do audio out before
02:41  portnoy: I've seen tons that say that they do not carry audio
02:41  Tomis: you look at the specs mattsh 
02:42  portnoy: So the ones that say they DON'T carry audio are the ones that don't pull audio from the headphone or usb ports?
02:43  Tomis: miniDP and HDMI both support audio
02:43  portnoy: Sweet
02:43  Tomis: so i don't know why they would say they don't
02:43  mattsh: @Tomis Thanks
02:43  mattsh: @Tomis I just realized Apple has a page on them here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2616?viewlocale=en_US
02:44  portnoy: On to monoprice.com
02:44  Tomis: the poblem was that apple cheeped out and decided not to implement the audio portion of the spec early on, so you'd have to go with some crazy miniDP>DVI>DVI+Audio>HDMI
02:44  Tomis: but recent models support audio over miniDP
02:45  Tomis: that information looks to be outdated mattsh 
02:45  mattsh: @Tomis really? I don't know where else to find info then. Can you point me in the right direction please?
02:45  Tomis: apple.com > support > specs
02:45  Tomis: or everymac.com
02:46  Tomis: or system profiler.app on your machine
02:51  mattsh: i just ordered the machine so i can't system profile it 
02:51  mattsh: i will look through that site
02:51  mattsh: thanks
02:56  mattsh: yeah that seems quite outdated
02:56  mattsh: even the pin # is wrong
02:58  mattsh: @Tomis that was confusing me
03:01  koro: can someone explain how the "instant on" in the new macbook airs differ from normal behavior in macbooks (resume from sleep instantly? i thought that already existed)
03:01  koro: or is this an instant "resume from hibernation"?
03:01  mattsh: Would anyone be able to recommend between this:
03:02  mattsh: http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/8566DDR3S8GP/
03:02  mattsh: and this:
03:02  mattsh: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Modules-1066MHz-KTA-MB1066K2-8G/dp/B001PS9UKW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1287881921&sr=8-2
03:02  mattsh: similar price, but one is OWC, the other Kingston
03:02  mattsh: for a Mac Mini 2010 Unibody HDMI
03:02  mattsh: *excited for it*
03:02  koro: oh it's just resume from hibernation on an SSD...
03:02  koro: lol
03:03  thelostpatrol:  i need to get my battery fixed/replaced
03:16  Tomis: after sleeping for an hour the machine goes into hibernation koro
03:17  Tomis: hopefully it's something they'll bring to the rest of the line in an update
03:21  koro: Tomis: a software update you mean?
03:21  koro: i don't think that would be possible... unless it's just the computer turning on and going to hibernation (which would be weird)
03:21  Tomis: yea koro 
03:21  koro: it sounds like this thing goes straight from sleep to hibernation, or doesn't it?
03:22  koro: i wouldn't like my macbook turning on when it's in my backpack in an airplane compartment
03:22  koro: even if it's just for a brief transition
03:23  Tomis: when you put it to sleep, it writes the hibernation image
03:24  Tomis: so it's allready to hibernate
03:24  Tomis: all it has to do is shutdown
03:24  Tomis: then when you turn it back on, it finds the hibernation image and restores the system to that state
03:27  koro: um, by default that's what macbooks do
03:28  koro: they write the hibernation image when put to sleep
03:28  koro: but i hate that
03:28  koro: when i put it to sleep i don't want my HD spinning
03:28  Tomis: ah huh
03:28  koro: if i had an SSD i wouldn't mind
03:30  koro: i use hibernatemode 0 to avoid that
03:30  koro: if i really want to hibernate, i go to hibernatemode 1
03:31  Tomis: or just let the system do as it's designed and don't worry about it
03:32  Tomis: would be nice if you could hold a modifier key and have it go straight to hibernate
03:36  koro: indeed.

04:15 @bashusr: is it a gui command?
04:15 @bashusr: then you have to do it at logon
04:16 @bashusr: if it is a CLI or daemon program
04:16 @bashusr: you can do it as a service
04:16  osxdude: it's actually screen
04:16  osxdude: I'd like it to start on boot for me
04:16 @bashusr: osxdude: GNU screen?
04:16  osxdude: yep
04:16  osxdude: so I can just attach to it
04:16 @bashusr: hmmmmmmm
04:17  osxdude: yup
04:17 @bashusr: i did that on linux
04:17 @bashusr: never on OSX
04:17 * bashusr thinks hard
04:17  ChrisAM: give crontab a try
04:18 @bashusr: ChrisAM: you can't do a crontab on boot?
04:18  osxdude: well, crontab does a command for an interval of time
04:18  osxdude: not on boot
04:18  ChrisAM: Why not?
04:18  ChrisAM: sure it can
04:18 @bashusr: ChrisAM: what is that command?
04:18  ChrisAM: @reboot
04:18 @bashusr: only think i can think of is * * * * * 
04:18 @bashusr: oh
04:18 @bashusr: you're right =P
04:20 @bashusr: http://www.plouj.com/blog/2008/03/31/howto-run-rtorrent-from-cron-inside-screen/
04:20 @bashusr: looks promising
04:21  fleebailey33: rtorrent ftw
04:21 @bashusr: fleebailey33: !!
04:21  fleebailey33: bashusr: i use rtorrent + wtorrent
04:21 @bashusr: ignore that =P
04:21  fleebailey33: but i hate you
04:22 * bashusr hates you too
04:22  fleebailey33: good
04:30  Kasm279: fleebailey33: i have an idea
04:30  fleebailey33: Kasm279: want a cookie?
04:30  Kasm279: on the LEM swaplist a guy has a G4/500MHz CPU for sale for $15
04:31  fleebailey33: k
04:31  Kasm279: get that and put it into the G3 :D
04:31  Kasm279: then i can skype and iDVD
04:31  Kasm279: >:D
04:31  Tomis: lol
04:31  fleebailey33: lol
04:31  Kasm279: then move the G3/400 into the Molar Mac
04:31  Kasm279: which is currently 266MHz
04:32  Kasm279: would have to OC the FSB on the molar mac though
04:32  Kasm279: what do you think fleebailey33?
04:32  fleebailey33: get a newer mac
04:32  fleebailey33: :P
04:33 @bashusr: woah
04:33 @bashusr: g4 500Mhz for 15 dollars?
04:33 @bashusr: boo
04:33 @bashusr: i have 1 of those =/
04:33 @bashusr: that's all it's worth?
04:34  Tomis: 15 bucks is too much
04:39  Kasm279: bashusr: the CPU and heatsink only
04:39  Kasm279: not the whole comp
04:39 @bashusr: oh
04:39 @bashusr: i have the whole computer
04:40  Kasm279: [20:30:56] <Kasm279> on the LEM swaplist a guy has a G4/500MHz CPU for sale for $15
04:40  l34k: hello i'm having a rather serious problem in which my acomdata external 250g wont be repaired by diskutil
04:40 @bashusr: l34k: what does that mean?
04:40  l34k: and as far as i've tried, i can't get SecureHD to recognize it
04:40  l34k: i have an external harddrive which i cannot access
04:40 @bashusr: l34k: yeah, but i mean... is it failing?
04:40  l34k: i have no idea, i don't think it is
04:41  l34k: it was working
04:41  l34k: not too long ago
04:41  l34k: i've only just upgraded to 10.5 so i don't know if that matters at all
04:41  Kasm279: l34k: what comp are you on btw?
04:41  Kasm279: just curious >.>
04:41 @bashusr: l34k: what's the disk format?
04:41  l34k: macbookpro 1st gen
04:42  l34k: bashusr i'm not sure where to find the disc format information
04:42  ChrisAM: Anyone in virginia? 10 G5's w/ monitors at auction for $100 currently.
04:42  ChrisAM: http://www.govdeals.com/index.cfm?fa=Main.Item&itemID=1457&acctID=892
04:42  Tomis: disk utility will tell you l34k 
04:43  natrium1970: I have a scanner with ADF that only scans one sided physically. Any suggestions on software that will scan in two passes and automatically shuffle the pages?
04:44 @bashusr: ChrisAM: G5s?
04:44 @bashusr: that's pretty good
04:45  k-man: is there some way to run an update server on my network so all the macs download software updates from the server rather than downloading updates from apple each time?
04:45  Kasm279: inb4 its over nine thousand
04:45 @bashusr: dual or single core?
04:45  Tomis: run a caching proxy k-man 
04:45  Tomis: it will work for updates from apple and other software on your machine
04:45  k-man: Tomis: i thought apple might have something to do it rather than reply on a caching proxy
04:45  ChrisAM: bashusr ... this is the inside... looks like dual processor: http://www.govdeals.com/photos/892/892_1457_6.JPG
04:46  Tomis: you could get mac os x server, it will let you set it up as an update server k-man 
04:46  Kasm279: ChrisAM: **MOST CPU'S HAVE SOME RAM INSTALLED**
04:46  Kasm279: i didn't know you put the RAM into the CPU
04:46  Tomis: but for home use, i'd just use a caching proxy
04:46  Kasm279: or the SATA HAR DDRIVES
04:46  Kasm279: or that you could put software on a CPU
04:46  Tomis: yea, they're using CPU to mean the whole machine
04:46  Kasm279: and yes, its a dual
04:46  l34k: bashusr http://pastebin.com/DdQUUT8k
04:47  ChrisAM: And it's also some government clerk who has no idea about computers writing the description.
04:47  l34k: i'm not sure what i'm looking for, but i do think it's in mac journaled
04:47  k-man: Tomis: ok, thanks
04:48 @bashusr: l34k: it says that that is a CDROM
04:48 @bashusr: what are you talking baout
04:48 @bashusr: ?
04:48  l34k: it is a cdrom part
04:48 @bashusr: huh?
04:48  l34k: if you read further, you can see it is connected via usb
04:48 @bashusr: i htought you said your disk is broken?
04:49  l34k: i can't access the hd; the way acomdata has it set up is you login through a small partition
04:49  Tomis: huh?
04:49  Tomis: what crazy setup is this?
04:49  l34k: my grandaughter got it for my birthday lol
04:50 @bashusr: l34k: what is acomdata?
04:50 @bashusr: yeah
04:50  l34k: the maker of my hd
04:50 @bashusr: what crazy setup is this???
04:50  l34k: the thing is
04:50  Tomis: ok so why does it have this crazy SecureHD crap then
04:50  l34k: while i was still in 10.4
04:50  l34k: it worked fine
04:50  l34k: but last week up finally updated to 10.5
04:50  l34k: and i'm not sure if it's a driver problem
04:50  l34k: or the 
04:50  l34k: HD is bad or something else
04:51  Tomis: did you try to set up whole disk encryption or something?
04:51  l34k: i don't remember if that is the case
04:51  l34k: and
04:51  l34k: when i go to diskutil to verify so i can repair permissions
04:51  Tomis: so how did you get this crazy acomdata whatever login crap
04:51  l34k: let me paste it
04:52  l34k: Verifying volume ?CD PART?
04:52  l34k: Verify volume failed: Invalid request.
04:52  l34k: Tomis it was working right out of the box
04:52  Tomis: no
04:52  l34k: so i didn't bother messing with it
04:52  Tomis: that's not the default setup
04:52  Tomis: there isn't some seperate login you have to do outside of os x
04:53  l34k: the manual suggested this be the case
04:53  Tomis: the manual to what
04:53  l34k: this HD came with a setup manual
04:53  Tomis: huh?
04:53  l34k: there is a copy of it on the CDPART
04:53  l34k: i'll upload it
04:53  Tomis: so you upgraded the internal hard drive manually?

04:55 @richardcavell: damn didn't work
04:55  Tomis: an external backup drive?
04:55 @bashusr: richardcavell: hi

04:55  Kasm279: richardcavell: /cs topic ##mac
04:55 @bashusr: welcome Mr. new op
04:55  Kasm279: instead of /topic ##mac
04:55  l34k: it doesn't recognize the CDpart for what it is to let me login to it
04:55  Tomis: to logi nto what
04:55  Tomis: i'm not following you
04:55 @bashusr: you were trying to talk to me richardcavell 
04:55 @bashusr: i never caught you
04:56  Kasm279: Tomis: to let you access the hard drive
04:56  Tomis: you plug in your backup drive, it mounts
04:56  Tomis: there's nothing to login to

04:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac -o richardcavell]
04:56 @bashusr: so tell me a bit about yourself richardcavell 
04:56  Kasm279: only after you login Tomis
04:56 @bashusr: since i finally made it here
04:56  l34k: ah
04:56  l34k: i see the confusion, Tomis 
04:56  Kasm279: it works like the U3 drives do im guessing
04:56  richardcavell: bashusr: I'm 33, a doctor who specialises in law, frequently attend Melbourne Uni and Monash Uni to do research
04:56  l34k: i have to login to it's little client so it will mount
04:57  Kasm279: no wait Tomis
04:57  Kasm279: you can't use U3 >.>
04:57  richardcavell: Been a Mac man since 2004 and wish that I had been for much longer now that I've made the switch
04:57  Tomis: so they've got some wack-ass custom setup where the thing mounts like a CD drive
04:57  Tomis: you open an app on it and "login"
04:57  Kasm279: l34k: and the drive with the login stuff won't mount
04:57  Tomis: and then it presents its self as a normal hard drive?
04:57 @bashusr: richardcavell: doctor?
04:57  Tomis: what a pain in the ass
04:57  richardcavell: yeah
04:57  l34k: Kasm279 ya
04:57 @bashusr: like a phd doctor?
04:57  Kasm279: Tomis: mounts as two drives
04:57 @bashusr: or a medical doctor?
04:57  l34k: Tomis i agree
04:57  richardcavell: like a medical degree doctor
04:57  Tomis: chuck that POS and get a normal hard drive
04:57  Kasm279: you cna only access the second one after logging in
04:57  Tomis: make your life easy, sheesh
04:57 @bashusr: that does law?
04:58 @bashusr: how are they related?
04:58  richardcavell: bashusr: I research into medical law
04:58  l34k: Tomis that's why i was trying to log into this one, actually
04:58  richardcavell: and forensics
04:58  l34k: lol
04:58  l34k: i was getting tired of it
04:58  Tomis: if you want a secure backups, just backup to an encrypted disk image
04:58  Kasm279: l34k: do you have any other Macs around the house?
04:58  l34k: Kasm279 sadly no
04:58  Kasm279: and/or does the software work on windows?
04:58 @bashusr: richardcavell: interesting
04:59  l34k: Tomis just what i intended to do
04:59  l34k: Kasm279 just a few old laptops
04:59  Tomis: well you've upped the machien to 10.5
04:59  l34k: most of which have ubuntu
04:59  Tomis: just plug in a backup drive and start from there
04:59 @bashusr: richardcavell: so how long have you been frequenting this channel?

05:06  [Waterfox]: richardcavell: also, I was going to oppose because of how you exaggerated everything in 2007 and got your sysop removed
05:06  [Waterfox]: well, requested for it to be removed
05:06  richardcavell: [Waterfox]: Yep
05:06  richardcavell: At the time I was under a fair bit of pressure, feeling distant from wikipedia
05:07  richardcavell: over the Essjay thing
05:07  Tomis: lol
05:07  richardcavell: It was in 2008 that I requested desysopping
05:07  [Waterfox]: richardcavell: another problem was that the crat was right. *admins have no authority*
05:07 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 87 seconds
05:07  [Waterfox]: 23:06 < richardcavell> [Waterfox]: I'm pretty sure that back in 2005,2006  unsourced but correct info in BLPs was acceptable.   Things have changed.
05:07  [Waterfox]: it is important for admins to know up-to-date policies
05:07  richardcavell: Yes, I agree
05:08 @bashusr: richardcavell: hi
05:08 @bashusr: pm?
05:08  richardcavell: bashusr: sure
05:08  richardcavell: are you going to say that Waterfox and I are off topic?
05:09 @bashusr: no
05:09 @bashusr: i'm interviewing you
05:09 @bashusr: =P
05:09 @bashusr: and i have no clue what you and waterfox are talking about
05:09  fleebailey33: why not me
05:10  richardcavell: [Waterfox]: Don't worry, there's no harm done.  I will apply for adminship again sometime.  I'm keen to show that I can change and learn.
05:10  [Waterfox]: richardcavell: I'd be pleased to nom you at that point ;)
05:11  richardcavell: The article that I got in most trouble for was [[Josie Parrelli]].
05:12  richardcavell: I exaggerated my knowledge of her.  Although I have worked with her, I don't know her *that* well and haven't spoken to her for at least 3 years.
05:12  richardcavell: I'm not sure that I really do have a conflict of interest over her.
05:12  richardcavell: If not, I'd like to help write her biography with sources.
05:12  richardcavell: There are plenty of them at Channel 31.
05:19  richardcavell: Does anyone here have a view on the reliability of Time Machine?  I've had to rely on it once and it worked pretty well.  But I worry about the 'image' being fragmented over so many backup points.
05:20 @bashusr: richardcavell: i would not rely on it as an image
05:21 @bashusr: i tried using time machine
05:21 @bashusr: and doing a clean format
05:21 @bashusr: Developer tools did not work after the restore
05:21 @bashusr: i had to reinstall developer tools
05:21 @bashusr: i recommend superduper or CCC 
05:21  richardcavell: Well when I say an 'image', I mean that it stores incremental changes over successive backup points, so that the true image of any given point in time is fragmented over multiple restore points
05:21 @bashusr: if your'e imaging
05:21  richardcavell: Well I have two 250 Gig external hard disks, and a 250 Gig internal one
05:22  richardcavell: I clone my internal to one of the externals with CCC
05:22  richardcavell: and I Time Machine to the other 
05:22 @bashusr: time machine is quite reliable for files
05:22 @bashusr: like in documents and such
05:23  Tomis: yea i wouldn't use time machine for anything other than user files
05:23 @bashusr: Tomis: yeah, how does it do on permissions?
05:24  Tomis: seams fine to me bashusr 
05:24 @bashusr: i still wonder why developer tools stopped working after i re-installed OSX and restored from time machine
05:25  richardcavell: bashusr: did you restore at a particular time?
05:25  richardcavell: see, that's what bothers me about TM
05:25  richardcavell: it's great for individual files but I worry about its robustness for going back in time
05:25  richardcavell: some 3rd party products are terrific for going back in time
05:26 @bashusr: richardcavell: i don't have too great experieince with it
05:26 @bashusr: as i don't have a time capsole
05:26 @bashusr: capsule*
05:26  richardcavell: You can use an external hard disk fine
05:26  richardcavell: I did just now
05:26 @bashusr: i've been using BackupPC though
05:26  richardcavell: I religiously backup everything
05:26 @bashusr: i'm trying to do so
05:26  richardcavell: Been using computers for long enough to have learned that lesson
05:26 @bashusr: but, it's not working too well
05:26 @bashusr: no time to setup backup systems
05:26 @bashusr: richardcavell: make sure you backup offsite!
05:27  richardcavell: in case of fire etc?
05:27 @bashusr: theft
05:27  richardcavell: I used to store one of the external hard disks at my work place
05:27 @bashusr: i'm always afraid of theft
05:27  richardcavell: My system is in the order of 100 gigs
05:27  richardcavell: is there anywhere online that will give you that kind of storage for free?
05:28  richardcavell: And I don't want to send that kind of data over the internet
05:28 @bashusr: what i've been trying to setup, but it's been proving to be complicated
05:28 @bashusr: is a network of backup systems with my friends
05:28  richardcavell: so you backup to each other?
05:28 @bashusr: i have a 2TB at a friend's with ssh access
05:28 @bashusr: yeah
05:28 @bashusr: very low likelihood of both of us being robbed at the same time
05:28 @bashusr: and if an earthquake or something worse happens
05:29 @bashusr: my data isn't important =P
05:29  richardcavell: you want to set up an rsync script
05:29 @bashusr: oh
05:29  Tomis: hmm
05:29 @bashusr: i don't trust my friend's site
05:29 @bashusr: well, not that i don't trust... but i prefer it to be hidden
05:29  Tomis: it would be nice if osx had something to dynamically switch the network settings per network
05:30  richardcavell: So that at a regular time of day, it incrementally copies the newer files over
05:30 @bashusr: so what i setup or trying to setup is LVM snapshots encrypted with GPG
05:30 @bashusr: i did that for ZFS
05:30 @bashusr: but opensolaris is no longer supported
05:30  richardcavell: You'd have to do incremental backups or it would take too much bandwidth
05:30 @bashusr: and oracle seems to want to close opensolaris so i better migrate away =(
05:30 @bashusr: you can see what i did
05:31  richardcavell: For the same amount of effort you could buy an external hard disk, clone everything to it, and bury it in a tupperware container in the backyard.
05:31 @bashusr: http://bashusr.com/wordpress/?page_id=32
05:31 @bashusr: richardcavell: but my backups happen every day automagically =)
05:31 --- Tomis2 is now known as Tomis
05:32  richardcavell: Well that's the idea of the Time Capsule too, isn't it?
05:32  richardcavell: It just sits there wirelessly backing up every hour
05:32 @bashusr: but mine is offsite!
05:32 @bashusr: =)
05:32  richardcavell: if you bury your hard disk it will be immune from fire, flood, etc
05:33 @bashusr: richardcavell: and how will i update it every day?
05:33 @bashusr: i'll have to dig it up!
05:33 @bashusr: too complicated!
05:33  richardcavell: yes
05:33  richardcavell: I always had the idea if I had a business I would have a fireproof safe
05:34  richardcavell: up high where water won't get to it
05:34  Tomis: bu heat rises
05:34  richardcavell: When the fire brigade find your house on fire, they flood it
05:34  Tomis: what you really want is a water proof padded safe
05:35  richardcavell: yeah
05:35  Tomis: in the event of a fire, an ejection meganism is triggered
05:35  richardcavell: no don't need to eject
05:35  Tomis: flinging the safe away from your burning house, to safety
05:35 @bashusr: richardcavell: yea
05:35 @bashusr: they always flood it
05:35 @bashusr: richardcavell: but still, the backups have to be automatic
05:35 @bashusr: in the busy-ness of life
05:35 @bashusr: you won't remember to backup
05:36  richardcavell: oh no I remember
05:36  richardcavell: I backup all the time
05:36 @bashusr: richardcavell: i don't have the time
05:36 @bashusr: that's why i'm trying to make it a programable automatic job
05:37  richardcavell: Now I'm defragging my Time Machine with iDefrag
05:37  Tomis: why richardcavell 
05:37  richardcavell: It forces the files to be rewritten
05:37  richardcavell: so they're fresh
05:37  Tomis: huh?
05:37  richardcavell: Freshly laid magnetic signals
05:38 @bashusr: richardcavell: you should look into ZFS
05:38  Tomis: why would you care how fragged your backup disk is
05:38 @bashusr: well, not anymore that opensolaris is going away
05:38 @bashusr: but zfs has that too
05:38  Tomis: it's not like you're constantly pulling data off it
05:38 @bashusr: a hash checksum function to make sure all your data is still there
05:38 @bashusr: Tomis: you know data can become corrupt even without use?
05:38  richardcavell: bashusr: like you said, OpenSolaris is pretty dead now
05:39  richardcavell: I've setup iDefrag to verify all writes.  That's good enough for me.
05:39  Tomis: i doubt it bashusr 
05:39  Tomis: unless you're regularly setting off EMPs or seriously abusing your disk
05:39 @bashusr: richardcavell: i'm waiting for the other zfs-like FS
05:39 @bashusr: btrfs
05:40 @bashusr: Tomis: for the paranoid - it happens =P
05:40  richardcavell: is that Reiser FS?
05:40 @bashusr: richardcavell: nope
05:41  richardcavell: I'm astonished that there's no defragger for ext
05:41  richardcavell: And I doubt that there ever will be
05:41 @bashusr: zfs scrub: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1405/zfs-how-to-fsck-or-check-filesystem-integrity-with-scrub/
05:41  richardcavell: in the time it would take to write one, SSDs will become more widespread
05:41 @bashusr: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs
05:41  richardcavell: and defragging will be obsolete and a bad idea
05:41 @bashusr: has many of the features as zfs, but better implemented and fully GPL
05:41 @bashusr: so you will see it in linux
05:42  ChrisAM: I'd kill for reiserfs support.
05:43 @bashusr: why?
05:43 @bashusr: is reiser really that good?
05:43 @bashusr: i used it and i had it corrupted before
05:43 @bashusr: so i stopped and went back to ext3
05:43  ChrisAM: sorry, it was a bad joke.
05:43 @bashusr: oh
05:43  richardcavell: bashusr: that looks interesting
05:44 @bashusr: it has no advantage to ext3 in my experience
05:44  richardcavell: ChrisAM: yeah haha
05:44  richardcavell: ReiserFS would have been good but the creator ended up in jail
05:44 @bashusr: richardcavell: jail??
05:44 @bashusr: haha
05:44 @bashusr: really
05:44  richardcavell: yeah he killed his wife
05:44 @bashusr: i didn't know the story behind it
05:44 @bashusr: oh boy
05:44 @bashusr: that's terrible
05:44 @bashusr: i jumped on to reiser when ext2 was popular
05:44 @bashusr: back then ext had no journaling
05:45 @bashusr: so it was as bad as fat32
05:45  richardcavell: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_reiser
05:45 @bashusr: and reiser was great compared to that
05:45 @bashusr: but then i had 1 power outage that the journaling didn't fix
05:45 @bashusr: and i lost data on my drive
05:45 @bashusr: and the whole thing started acting funny
05:45 @bashusr: and i never used reiser again
05:46 @bashusr: that's scary
05:47  JeffATL2: imovie '09 - i have some transcoded video to import and I transcoded in my usual known good fashion but when i try to import the files are greyed out - maybe i got the extension wrong when i transcoded?  i'm using the extention .mp4
05:47 @bashusr: i'm out
05:47 @bashusr: gnite/morning
05:47 @bashusr: take good care of the channel richardcavell 
05:47 @bashusr: welcome to the op team!
05:48  richardcavell: bashusr: I will
05:48  Cam: How do I edit my terminal prompt? nano ~/.bashsrc?
05:49 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
05:50  Cam: KASM
05:50  Cam: DON'T GO
05:50  Kasm279|Away: >.>
05:50  Kasm279|Away: i was going to go fly a plane
05:51  Cam: <3
05:51  Cam: xPlane?
05:51  richardcavell: I've been downloading all my games on Steam.  It's literally been 36 hours so far.
05:51  richardcavell: And we're still going
05:51  richardcavell: I'm going to overheat Valve's servers.  Their electricity bill will be massive this month because of me.
05:52  ChrisAM: Cam ... I set my environment variables in ~/.bash_profile
05:53  Cam: ChrisAM; Where do I define PS1?
05:54  ChrisAM: I set mine in ~/.bash_profile
05:55  Cam: Ok.
05:56  JeffATL2: i guess there had to have been a transcoding problem - i can't get my files to play in QT, streamclip, or vlc
06:00  richardcavell: I see that Windows 7 has a Windows Backup feature now
06:00  richardcavell: obviously inspired by Time Machine
06:00  richardcavell: I'm going to give it a go
06:01  richardcavell: It can also create clones
06:01  richardcavell: OS X can't do that.
06:14  torchie: oh noes
06:15  torchie: this thing does a thing that another thing doesnt do
06:18  richardcavell: One thing that amuses me about Windows is that it has always been fiercely different to UNIX, and kept a lot of the esoteric UNIX features out, but as Windows has matured, it's incorporating more and more UNIX functionality.
06:26  tehbaut: anyone got their hands on one of the new macbook airs? I'm curious on how well it performs for video/flash gaming (yes, I know it doesn't come pre-loaded with flash)
06:29  torchie: man I'm starting to realize how sweet it would be to have an air 2010
06:29  torchie: no fans
06:30  torchie: like
06:30  torchie: no fans!
06:30  torchie: no fans, right?
06:30  tehbaut: heh, yeah... macbook fans are always running
06:30  tehbaut: so it seems
06:31 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
06:31  torchie: well mine's quiet until I use flash
06:32  torchie: it'd just be great to have a computer with no moving parts
06:32  torchie: now if only we could get rid of that unsightly hinge
06:32  torchie: and all of those buttons
06:32  torchie: and maybe add capacitive multitouch
06:32  torchie: to the screen
06:39  tehbaut: you did see why they didn't (and likely wont ever) make the screen multitouch, right?
06:40  tehbaut: Jobs says multi-touch was meant to live on the horizontal plane
06:40  tehbaut: something to that effect anyway
06:40  tehbaut: your arm will get tired working vertically, because it has no place to rest
06:41  torchie: well that's why you'd remove the hinge and keyboard
06:41  torchie: and have one single monolithic sort of "slate" or something
06:42  torchie: of course, to make the offer more appealing, the lower-powered hardware would have to be coupled with a mobile operating system
06:44  tehbaut: I think they call that an iPad, but I can't remember
06:45  almonds: hey, anyone have any ideas on how to make your mac anti-forensic so to speak
06:45  almonds: for example, use truecrypt, espionage
06:46  Tomis: don't download donkyporn almonds 
06:46  Tomis: problem solved
06:46  almonds: lol
06:46  almonds: im a computer forensics minor
06:46  almonds: @ st johns
06:47  Tomis: and of course, all the encryption in the world won't help when they break your knuckles and throw you away forever because you wouldn't give them your password
06:47  almonds: yea, pretty much, for the sake of my paper though, im looking more towards, wiping artifacts 
06:47  almonds: such as wiping var/log
06:47  Tomis: 7 pass erase is more then enough
06:48  almonds: technically 1 pass is enough
06:48  ChrisAM: 1 pass overwrite is sufficient.
06:48  almonds: 7 pass is more of a myth
06:48  Tomis: exactly, hence "more than" enough
06:48  almonds: 7 pass would be degrading your drive if its SSD
06:48  Tomis: well it's all you got for secure erase in the finder
06:49  almonds: but yea, any tips in regards to anti-forensic the mac
06:49  almonds: another one i have is disabling the sleepimage
06:49  ChrisAM: you can use srm from terminal and control the number of passes and stuff.
06:49  almonds: sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
06:49  almonds: sudo nvram "use-nvramrc?"=false
06:49  almonds: to disable sleepimage
06:49  almonds: and your mac sleeps quicker
06:49  almonds: that would classify as a anti-forensic tactic
06:50  Tomis: i'd think the sleep image would be encrypted if you have encrypted virtual memory on anyway
06:50  almonds: yea
06:50  almonds: its better to not have an image at all
06:50  Tomis: i guess
06:51  Tomis: personally i'd prefer they allow the option to go straight to hibernate, from the GUI
06:51  almonds: yea its pretty difficult to come up with some methods here
06:51  Tomis: FileVault for your files obviously
06:51  almonds: i would prefer truecrypt over filevault
06:51  almonds: filevault really slows down your mac
06:51  torchie: is what the 2010 air does when closing hibernation?
06:51  Tomis: not really
06:51  almonds: if you have an SSD its awesome
06:51  torchie: or is it just regular sleep
06:52  Tomis: after sleeping for an hour they shutdown torchie 
06:52  Tomis: when you select "sleep" all mac laptops write the hibernate image automatically
06:52  almonds: not just sleepimage 
06:52  torchie: a whole hour!?
06:52  almonds: i saw another one, called vm?
06:52  almonds: or something
06:52  ChrisAM: filevault works fine for me.
06:53  almonds: the reason filevault is messy is because lets say you want to disable it....
06:53  almonds: so lets say my mac is 250gb
06:53  EdLin: hi
06:53  almonds: i use 150gb
06:53  almonds: and fielvault is turned on
06:53  Tomis: that's not the same as it affecting performance almonds 
06:53  torchie: isn't filevault the one where if you don't know the password you're completely out of luck
06:53  torchie: forever
06:53  almonds: if i want to turn it off....i cant
06:53  Tomis: oh well, tha'ts the price you apy for security
06:53  Tomis: heh
06:53  ChrisAM: torchie ... that's a good thing.
06:53  almonds: it does effect performance 
06:54  EdLin: torchie, no, that's if you run Windows Vista.
06:54  almonds: i have used it on my 250gb , very slow
06:54  torchie: until you don't know the password
06:54  Tomis: not to a noticeable degree almonds 
06:54  EdLin: torchie, out of luck forever. ;-)
06:54  almonds: i guess it depends on what system
06:54  ChrisAM: I've got FileVault running on my 500gb drive.
06:54  almonds: this was on my black macbook
06:54  almonds: 2gb at the time
06:54  Tomis: it's more likely that your system is slow due to low ram
06:54  almonds: 250gig drive so the rpm would be slow
06:54  almonds: yea
06:55  torchie: what's it like being on lots of ram
06:55  Tomis: the capacity of the drive doesn't say anying about the rpm
06:55  EdLin: brb, as nobody seems to be trolled tonight. ;-)
06:55  Tomis: it's probably 4200 or 5400
06:55  almonds: notebook hd's usually have lower rpm
06:55  almonds: yea
06:55  almonds: 5400 for me
06:55  almonds: i upgraded my macbook since then, to 4gb and ssd
06:55  almonds: best thing i have ever done lol
06:55  Tomis: good move
06:55  almonds: apps launch like pop up ads
06:55  Tomis: i'm waiting until SSD isn't stupid expensive
06:56  almonds: its coming down rapidly now
06:56  almonds: def worth it
06:56  almonds: i have the ocz vertex from newegg
06:56  almonds: no complaints
06:56  Tomis: i'll wait until i can get 500GB SSD for $100
06:57  almonds: lol
06:57  almonds: like 10 years
06:57  Tomis: yup
06:57  Tomis: fine by me
06:57  almonds: it depends on your needs
06:57  Tomis: maybe they'll have the max write life problems fixed by then too
06:57  almonds: i store media on HDD's
06:58  almonds: i only store text and images on my laptop
06:58  Tomis: why
06:58  almonds: so i bought the 60gig ssd
06:58  almonds: no need for a 500
06:58  Tomis: ouch
06:58  Tomis: too small
06:58  almonds: it makes more sense though, depends on your needs
06:58  Tomis: if i can't keep it all in one place, it's not practical
06:58  Tomis: now where my 2TB laptops drives at yo
06:58  almonds: lol
06:59  Tomis: i put a 500GB 7200rpm in my macbook pro
06:59  torchie: how is it
06:59  almonds: this is the same reason the new air comes with a 64gb ssd opton
06:59  Tomis: i don't know, i up
06:59  almonds: they market based on needs
06:59  Tomis: 'd it immediately after getting it
06:59  almonds: web designers will not need more than 64gb
06:59  almonds: they store media externally 
06:59  Tomis: so i can't really say if it's noticable faster than then stock 320GB 5400rpm
07:00  torchie: I put 7200 320gb but I'm on stock 1gb ram on a 2006 macbook
07:00  Tomis: i'm gonna up the ram to 8gb in a couple years
07:00  Tomis: wouldn't run os x on less than 4GB these days
07:01  Tomis: the specs on the air are a disgrace
07:01  Tomis: 2gb, 64gb
07:01  Tomis: 1.4ghz
07:01  almonds: yea it is
07:01  Tomis: useless machine
07:01  almonds: 1.4 is appalling 
07:01  Tomis: might as well get an ipad at that rate
07:01  almonds: the only reason they can do 1.4 is because its SSD
07:01  almonds: so it kinda makes up for the lack of cpu
07:01  almonds: but still
07:01  almonds: horrible
07:02  torchie: is it really that bad
07:02  torchie: isn't 1.4ghz just on the 11 air
07:02  Tomis: yes
07:02  Tomis: that whole product is horrible
07:02  torchie: that's still rocking harder than an Atom isn't it
07:02  Tomis: if they'd drop the price to $799 i could forgive them
07:02  almonds: yea
07:03  almonds: its not that bad considering the target market for that model is people who type
07:03  almonds: surf the web
07:03  almonds: students?
07:03  almonds: any processing would kill the battery 
07:03  torchie: 11 air as the gateway mac instead of mac mini would be pretty sweet
07:03  almonds: so for students i can see it working fine
07:04  Tomis: the target market is people who like to pay out the wazzoo and get jack-all
07:04  almonds: lol
07:04  Tomis: the only "feature" of the machine is that it's lightweight
07:04  torchie: does the air 13" have a fan?
07:04  Tomis: that's their justification for the high price
07:04  Tomis: i'm sure it does torchie 
07:04  torchie: :(
07:04  Tomis: doesn't mean they need to use it though
07:04  almonds: j never seen a 1.4gz dual core before
07:04  almonds: has anyone else
07:04  almonds: i*
07:05  torchie: so much for no moving parts period
07:05  Tomis: you can look at the teardown pics torchie 
07:05  Tomis: ifixit did a teardown
07:05  torchie: looking
07:05  Tomis: apple even has pictures as part of the marketing
07:05  torchie: all the teardowns I found were for the 11
07:06  Branes: All of Apple's laptops have at least one fan in them. At least, every laptop back to the PowerBook 520c has had a fan in it.
07:06  Branes: The Airs (all generations) have fans.
07:06  torchie: weak
07:06  almonds: so the air does not even have your typical hard drive
07:06  almonds: no 2.5inch
07:06  torchie: nope
07:07  almonds: interesting
07:07  torchie: storage is soldered straight onto the board
07:07  Tomis: the previous generation used a 1.8" drive
07:07  Branes: No; it uses a custom-built solid state drive module.
07:07  torchie: oh
07:08  morpheuspr: silvernode: lol
07:08  Branes: almonds: The new Air is a lot like the old Air, in that the CPU used is a custom chip made especially for Apple, and Apple are the *only* company Intel willsell that chip to for six months.
07:09  silvernode: Hi
07:09  almonds: oo
07:09  morpheuspr: hey
07:09  torchie: 13"'s got 2.13ghz :D
07:09  almonds: i look forward to playing with it @ the apple store
07:09  almonds: curious how good a 1.4 is
07:09  silvernode: So I was wondering, on a mac can you run "sudo rm -rf /* in terminal?
07:09  silvernode: "
07:09  almonds: yes
07:10  almonds: do it
07:10  silvernode: almonds, Nice
07:10  almonds: report back
07:10  silvernode: almonds, I don't think I will be able to.
07:10  TechnoticRacoon: hello guys
07:10  morpheuspr: lol
07:10  almonds: why not
07:10  almonds: u gotta be positive 
07:10  Branes: Depends on the Mac. It's not possible on at least seven of mine :)
07:10  silvernode: almonds, because it will remove my system root directory.
07:10  almonds: nah 
07:10  almonds: apple has built in protection 
07:10  TechnoticRacoon: I love irssi, I can talk about macs in one section, and troll linux users in another
07:11  TechnoticRacoon: hehehe
07:11  Branes: Most of my Macs don't have anything resembling a commandline.
07:11  TechnoticRacoon: err
07:11  silvernode: almonds, I thought they might have some sort of block :-P
07:11  morpheuspr: lol
07:11  TechnoticRacoon: i ment windows*
07:11  TechnoticRacoon: fail on my part
07:11  almonds: lol
07:11  morpheuspr: TechnoticRacoon: that you did
07:11  almonds: i was wondering 
07:11  almonds: is there really a windows channel
07:11  TechnoticRacoon: ##windows
07:12  torchie: yeah
07:12  TechnoticRacoon: most of the people in there are sysadmins
07:12  torchie: they're pretty cool in there actually
07:12  torchie: I haven't been in a while though
07:12  morpheuspr: you have to have active x installed though to join
07:12  TechnoticRacoon: and dont care about what you think
07:12  almonds: o sys admins
07:12  almonds: figured
07:12  TechnoticRacoon: i like them
07:12  silvernode: Not so say I'm trolling, but it is quite fun to observe a GNU/Linux IRC chat v.s a Mac IRC chat.
07:12  TechnoticRacoon: lol
07:12  TechnoticRacoon: i have now 3 windows open in irssi
07:12  almonds: i havent used windows since 2008, i think i forgot a lot of the basics
07:12  torchie: there's a cycle of trolling yo
07:13  TechnoticRacoon: so i can troll everyone at the same time!
07:13 * TechnoticRacoon wins
07:13  torchie: windows users troll the mac users, linux users troll the mac users, 
07:13  silvernode: Windows is full of non configuration and lack of command line power. At least OS X 10.6 is basically Unix.
07:13  torchie: well that's not much of a cycle
07:14  Kasm279: silvernode: not just 10.6
07:14  TechnoticRacoon: mac users get abused
07:14  silvernode: Kasm279, right
07:14  Kasm279: but 10.0-10.6
07:14  Kasm279: and probably 10.7 as well
07:14  Kasm279: :P
07:14  silvernode: Kasm279, In general OS X has some BDS base,
07:14  silvernode: BDS*
07:14  almonds: what is this os 10.7 stuff i hear about
07:14  silvernode: BSD*
07:14  almonds: a desktop app store?
07:14  almonds: serious?
07:14  torchie: 10.7
07:14  torchie: it comes with
07:14  TechnoticRacoon: thats not new
07:14  torchie: MISSION CONTROL
07:14  Kasm279: OpenBSD silvernode
07:14  Branes: torchie: When you've got the poor creatures using the computing equivalent of a stick with nails in it (Windows) and a lump of granite (linux) is it any suprise they are jealous of MacOS's sleek looks and extreme usability? :)
07:15  TechnoticRacoon: ubuntu has had an app store for 3 years
07:15  almonds: really
07:15  torchie: ubuntu has an app store technically
07:15  TechnoticRacoon: yeah
07:15  silvernode: Kasm279, Is it OpenBSD? hmmm Openbsd is a best.
07:15  silvernode: beast*
07:15  almonds: damn im so outta touch
07:15  Kasm279: with Mach, some stuff from apple themselves
07:15  Kasm279: and darwin
07:15  Tomis: since when does ubuntu have an app store
07:15  torchie: well they just recently got paid apps and started calling it something better than "synaptic package manager"
07:15  TechnoticRacoon: 2007
07:15  Tomis: heck, since when does linux have a commercial software market, lol
07:15  silvernode: Tomis, recently 
07:15  torchie: now it's "ubuntu software center"
07:15  almonds: oh
07:15  Kasm279: and not three years TechnoticRacoon
07:15  Kasm279: its only like
07:15  Kasm279: been one and a half
07:15  Kasm279: maybe two
07:15  Kasm279: but not three
07:15  almonds: apt-get isnt exactly an app store lol
07:15  almonds: but ok
07:15  TechnoticRacoon: meh
07:15  Kasm279: three years ago was 9.10 or 9.04
07:16  Kasm279: maybe even 8.10
07:16  TechnoticRacoon: still
07:16  torchie: yeah people lul around and are all I HAD AN APP STORE ITS CALLED apt-get
07:16  TechnoticRacoon: its not a new concept
07:16  almonds: anyone else worried 10.7 is getting too "commercial"
07:16  torchie: what's too commercial
07:16  TechnoticRacoon: and apple is killing them selves by not alowing refunds
07:16  Tomis: 10.7 of what
07:16  almonds: os x
07:16  Tomis: huh?
07:16  silvernode: Tomis, Ubuntu 10.10 now ships with an (I'll call it) "Alpha Software Store" which aims to bring commercial GNU/Linux applications to the masses. 
07:16  Tomis: no, mac os x is dead almonds 
07:17  Tomis: they're just backporting iOS features to it now
07:17  Tomis: that's what 10.7 is
07:17  TechnoticRacoon: i think macs are on a timebomb
07:17  almonds: yea
07:17  TechnoticRacoon: apple could care less
07:17  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: ?
07:17  torchie: I'm not gonna stop caring until I see XCode for ipad
07:17  Kasm279: what do you mean by timebomb?
07:17  TechnoticRacoon: im pretty sure os XI wont happen
07:17  almonds: i switched to mac because i like the power and unix shell, but its been getting too "commercial" , im not sure how to explain it
07:17  Kasm279: oh
07:17  almonds: too user friendly?
07:17  Kasm279: as in discontinuation
07:17  TechnoticRacoon: ios shall become mac osx
07:17  Tomis: lol
07:18  Tomis: it's always been commercial
07:18  Tomis: apple ain't a charity
07:18  silvernode: Well, Apple could care less about a lot of things, like the rights of their users. lol jailbreaking.
07:18  Tomis: and they're not some FOSS crap
07:18  almonds: excessive 
07:18  morpheuspr: its what the customers want 
07:18  Kasm279: my favorite version of OSX is still Tiger
07:18  Tomis: no, it's a company
07:18  TechnoticRacoon: i switched to linux cause hp thought 64bit vista would run fine on 1gb of ram
07:18  torchie: I haven't tigered in so long
07:18  Tomis: they figured out how to finally tap the mass market with the iOS
07:18  almonds: yea
07:18  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: thats for buying HP
07:18  Kasm279: derp
07:18  TechnoticRacoon: i won this 
07:18  ekx: Anyone here mildly experienced with FTP setup on OSX?
07:19  TechnoticRacoon: i use filezilla\\
07:19  TechnoticRacoon: it haz teh best stuff
07:19  Kasm279: eww filezilla
07:19  almonds: i never upgraded to snow leopard when they removed a lot of features from leopard, i see its going down hill
07:19  Tomis: you turn it on, you can access your files via FTP ekx
07:19  ekx: I mean server setup; I've got PureFTPd and multiple user/passes set up
07:19  Tomis: what features did they remove from leo?
07:19  torchie: removed?
07:19  almonds: for example, the ability to view the current WiFi password was removed in snow leopard, wtf?
07:19  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: on windows, SmartFTP>FileZilla
07:19  ekx: I want to make a "shared" folder for the FTP accts
07:19  almonds: the "show password"
07:19  Tomis: you mean the ones they never announced and finalyl shipped in snow leopard?
07:19  torchie: cyberduck
07:19  torchie: don't use finder for fpt
07:19  Tomis: no it wasn't almonds 
07:19  torchie: ftp*
07:19  Kasm279: torchie: wrong side
07:19  Kasm279: hes talking about a hose
07:19  Kasm279: host*
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: 10.7 needs a new theme
07:20  torchie: oh i see
07:20  torchie: my bad
07:20  Kasm279: not a server app
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: im not a fan of grey
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: or brushed metal
07:20  torchie: apple absolutely rocks gray
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: or anything resembling no color
07:20  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: iMac G3 ftw?
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: yep
07:20  torchie: what other color is appropriate for UI chrome
07:20  Kasm279: i have two of them here >.>
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: id like to see a black theme
07:20  almonds: imagine some day apple removed terminal access
07:20  Kasm279: ^
07:20  TechnoticRacoon: black themes rock
07:20  Tomis: they already did almonds , it's called iOS
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: lol
07:21  almonds: lolol
07:21  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: i have an indigop DV/400 and a revision d tray loader (333MHz)
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: nice
07:21  torchie: black and red
07:21  Kasm279: eww red
07:21  torchie: with flaming window animations when you press the close buttons
07:21  Kasm279: black and blue!
07:21  torchie: and anime wallpaper
07:21  Kasm279: hah
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: black and purple and orange....oh wait
07:21  torchie: don't forget the 3d cube
07:21  Kasm279: that would actually look cool TechnoticRacoon
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: yeah
07:21  Kasm279: torchie: fast user switching uses the cube
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: too bad an os already uses that color scheme
07:21  torchie: also wobbly windows
07:21  TechnoticRacoon: its called ubuntu
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:22  Kasm279: personally i would do black, blue, and hm
07:22  Kasm279: i dunno what else
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: any one use bbs's?
07:22  Kasm279: probably some light grey/white
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: telnet is still ftw
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: no matter how old it is
07:22  Kasm279: and ubuntu uses brown and orange >.>
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: nope
07:22  Kasm279: ssh>telnet :P
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: not anymore
07:22  Kasm279: WHAT
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: new them
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: theme^
07:22  Kasm279: THATS KUBUNTU'S TERITORY
07:22  TechnoticRacoon: do i need to do a screen shot?
07:22  Kasm279: yes please
07:23  TechnoticRacoon: i do have a dock and global menu on
07:23  TechnoticRacoon: so be warned
07:24  morpheuspr: TechnoticRacoon: lol
07:24  TechnoticRacoon: what
07:24  TechnoticRacoon: thats the only thing i like about osx
07:24  TechnoticRacoon: i cant stand being on windows with out my global menu
07:24  Tomis: global menu?
07:24  almonds: the bar on top
07:24  TechnoticRacoon: http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=119971
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: Tomis: you know the file,edit,etc. menu
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: next to the apple logo
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:25  Tomis: the menubar
07:25  Tomis: it has a name, don't objetify it, it has feelings you know
07:25 * Branes likes to get rid of the menubar where possible
07:25  almonds: lol
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: it is called the flobal menu
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: global^
07:25  TechnoticRacoon: not menubar:P
07:25  Kasm279: looks brown to me
07:26  TechnoticRacoon: Kasm279: you sir are color blind
07:26  morpheuspr: TechnoticRacoon: i see myself??
07:26  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: i mean
07:26  morpheuspr: TechnoticRacoon: :D
07:26  Kasm279: its a slightly brownish grey
07:26  almonds: i gotta start using ubuntu
07:26  Kasm279: its not black and blue
07:26  Kasm279: i see no blue besides chromium
07:26  almonds: whats the best way to get familiar with ubuntu
07:26  TechnoticRacoon: install it
07:26  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:26  almonds: yea i guess
07:26 * Branes would rather amputate his penis, one leg and both arms than use Ubuntu
07:26  almonds: play with it
07:26  TechnoticRacoon: oe use it in a vm
07:27  almonds: i currently use back-track in vm
07:27  almonds: same thing rite
07:27  almonds: pretty much
07:27  TechnoticRacoon: Branes: i'd rather do the same then have a android phone
07:27  Tomis: that's like asking "what's the best way to shoot myself in the face"
07:27  Tomis: why would you even consider it
07:27  TechnoticRacoon: java makes me wanna punch a baby
07:27  almonds: i like to be familiar 
07:27  torchie: I'm in a corner here
07:27  almonds: with all major OS
07:27  Kasm279: android has failed to impress me
07:27  TechnoticRacoon: meh
07:27  almonds: being a forensic minor i need to be able to navigate 
07:27  Branes: There's only two major OSes, Windows and MacOS. Everything else is a niche OS.
07:27  Kasm279: java does only a few good thing
07:27  Kasm279: err
07:28  TechnoticRacoon: android only has a better browser selection
07:28  TechnoticRacoon: i need opera to survive
07:28  Tomis: linux is pretty big in the server area
07:28  torchie: mac are expensive and not-awesome-chassissieeiad and I'm uninterested in windows
07:28  EdLin: Branes, you're excluding mobile OSs. I suspect desktop OSs in the larger scheme of things will be the niche.
07:28  TechnoticRacoon: macs are for people who like guis
07:28  torchie: how dare they!
07:28  TechnoticRacoon: i enjoy my green and black cli
07:29  TechnoticRacoon: it makes me feel good
07:29 * Branes is commandline-free and happy to stay that way
07:29  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, you can have a green and black cli on OS X.
07:29  Kasm279: TechnoticRacoon: opera ftw
07:29  almonds: yea
07:29  almonds: homebrew
07:29  torchie: darn people and their intuitive well designed interfaces
07:29  TechnoticRacoon: EdLin: but, i cant have a tiling windows manager in osx
07:29  torchie: android is just bullhonky
07:29  almonds: the android is insecure
07:29  TechnoticRacoon: if i wasnt so lazy i would be on awesome atm
07:30  almonds: if i borrow someones android for 2 minutes i can trojan it
07:30  almonds: very insecure phone
07:30  Tomis: that's true on any OS
07:30  torchie: I don't care about the security, I'm not the US president
07:30  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, ugh. tiling window managers. I hope you are a sysadmin of a Linux server farm, because that's all a tiling manager is good for, monitoring one.
07:30  torchie: it's just
07:30  torchie: android is like
07:30  torchie: maaaaaaan
07:30  torchie: come on man
07:30  TechnoticRacoon: EdLin: 
07:30  TechnoticRacoon: EdLin: nah, im just geeky like that
07:30  Tomis: if the user can download programs, they can run trojan programs
07:31  TechnoticRacoon: err enter fail
07:31  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, geeky doesn't mean self-torture, that's masochism.
07:31  TechnoticRacoon: ios should let developers atleast sideload apps
07:31  EdLin: like Gentoo
07:31  Tomis: how would that help apple TechnoticRacoon 
07:31  torchie: I hear gentoo makes you smart
07:31  TechnoticRacoon: EdLin: meh, i hate mice
07:31  EdLin: torchie, it makes your macbook melt
07:31  torchie: that's why we have touchscreens now
07:31  TechnoticRacoon: mice are only good for gaming
07:31  almonds: preyproject.com has a program to basically backdoor an android phone
07:32  Tomis: then developers could go outside of the app store and apple wouldn't get a profit from them
07:32  torchie: mice?
07:32  torchie: (dead)
07:32  TechnoticRacoon: mouse
07:32  TechnoticRacoon: whatever you wanna call it
07:32  Tomis: meese
07:32  torchie: mice are dead
07:32  EdLin: almonds, my phone runs both WinMo and Android, for double the security hole pleasure!
07:32  TechnoticRacoon: moose?
07:32  almonds: lol
07:32  torchie: you don't "run" winmo
07:32  EdLin: torchie, you run from it.
07:32  TechnoticRacoon: it runs you
07:34  EdLin: torchie, I just couldn't think of a cheaper way to get a fast Android phone off-contract than an HTC HD2 used at $225 from a ZDNet columnist. Android is awful on a 528MHz 2006 processor.
07:35  EdLin: torchie, now I have an awesome hacked phone, that can run ROMs based on at least 5 different Android phones with varients. :)
07:35  EdLin: torchie, I have the hots for the new Palm Pre 2 though, I must admit.
07:35  EdLin: too bad it's only on Veri$on in the US so far.
07:36  almonds: who's not from America here?
07:36  EdLin: almonds, Branes is from OZ
07:36  torchie: the palm pre 2
07:37  torchie: doesn't have a gyroscope
07:37  Tomis: i'm from the future
07:37  TechnoticRacoon: meh
07:37  almonds: whats OZ
07:37  EdLin: OZstralia
07:37  Branes: .au
07:37  TechnoticRacoon: web os has the best implmentation of multi tasking
07:37  almonds: lol
07:37  torchie: what
07:37  almonds: o ok
07:37  torchie: that's new
07:37  Branes: God's Own Earf Mate
07:37  almonds: i just watched a video on OZ
07:37  torchie: webos lets you have your cake and eat it too
07:37  almonds: you guys have a 10 billion dollar cattle export industry
07:38  torchie: now if only they'd come out with a slate phone
07:38  EdLin: torchie, I have the original 4.3" slate phone. :)
07:38  torchie: too big
07:38  EdLin: nah, not if you put it in a holster anyway.
07:39  richardcavell: almonds: I'm also from Oz
07:39  richardcavell: 10 billion a year?  Crikey, I didn't know that
07:39  torchie: how long has it been called oz
07:39  richardcavell: I spent $8 on 4 pieces of cattle at the supermarket today
07:39  EdLin: torchie, Samsung Galaxy S are a nice size, but they are from Samsung, which means poor build quality and 4 month support.
07:40  richardcavell: If ever a wonderful wiz there was, the wizard of Oz is one because
07:40  almonds: i think its north OZ
07:40  almonds: raise and export cattle to different nations
07:40  torchie: EdLin: don't forget apparently, incorrect file system and cruddy skin overlaid on android
07:40  EdLin: torchie, right, RFS, journaled FAT on flash.
07:41  torchie: welcome to "freedom!"
07:41  torchie: freedom for the manufacturers to use the wrong file system and sell the phone to you anyway
07:41  EdLin: torchie, you can always download the source from Andy Rubin. ;-)
07:41  richardcavell: almonds: you mean live or as beef?
07:42  almonds: livestock
07:43  Kasm279: android is failing its motives
07:43  richardcavell: they're subsequently turned into beef I bet
07:43  Kasm279: its open source, but its hopelessly locked down!
07:43  torchie: I'll hand it to them though, I used an epic 4g the other day and the touch response was buttery smooth
07:43  torchie: surprise!
07:43  torchie: that was the motive the whole time
07:43  almonds: probably 
07:43  almonds: i wish i had my beef from AU as well
07:43  EdLin: Kasm279, they're not selling it to you, they're selling it to the carriers and OEMs.
07:43  torchie: but if you get some guys on a stage and have them chant about "freedom" and "openness," everyone falls for it
07:43  almonds: i dont trust american beef
07:44  torchie: it's really freedom for the carriers and OEMs, because android is not for people
07:44  Kasm279: whats it for then
07:44  Kasm279: robots?
07:44  EdLin: torchie, Steve Jobs complimented Palm during a keynote.
07:44  Kasm279: WOAH
07:44  Kasm279: EdLin: what did he say?
07:44  torchie: palm is salvation
07:45  Kasm279: Palm ftw
07:45  EdLin: said they were like Apple, Palm "understands software"
07:45  Kasm279: webOS is epic
07:45  EdLin: yep
07:45  Kasm279: best mobile OS out atm imo
07:45  EdLin: I want it GSM, so when I travel, I can use it.
07:45  EdLin: but not on AT&T.
07:45  Kasm279: hoever the pre is utter shyte in the build quality department
07:45  torchie: webos is the alpha and omega, the jiggity jam
07:45  Kasm279: something that Palm isn't known for in the past
07:46  torchie: yeah
07:46  EdLin: Pre 2 has better build quality.
07:46 * Kasm279 points at Palm V and m515
07:46  torchie: treos and even centro and treo pro were absolute tanks
07:46  Kasm279: verison's pre?
07:46  Kasm279: yreah
07:46  EdLin: my first cell phone was a Centro.
07:46  Kasm279: only build quality issue i have had was with the T|W
07:46  torchie: my first smartphone was a centro :D
07:46  EdLin: Kasm279, no, that's Pre Plus.
07:46 * Kasm279 is jealous
07:46  torchie: the pre 2 is still a slider
07:46  torchie: so yeah.
07:46  Kasm279: wait
07:47  Kasm279: did HP release a new Pre?@?
07:47  torchie: yeah
07:47  torchie: pre 2
07:47  EdLin: yes
07:47  Kasm279: wow
07:47  torchie: verizon/at&T
07:47  Kasm279: that surprised me
07:47  Kasm279: i wonder
07:47  EdLin: torchie, its on AT&T too?
07:47 * Kasm279 sees if Palm Deksotp 4.1.2 is still up
07:47  torchie: apparently
07:47  torchie: it's just a slight step up from the pre plus
07:47  torchie: the touch response might actually be up to par with iphone this time though
07:47  EdLin: it has a 1GHz processor and a WVGA or better screen, that's a lot better than a Pre Plus, despite similar appearances.
07:48  Kasm279: awesome
07:48  Kasm279: im glad to see Palm is still alive
07:48  torchie: it's the same resolution
07:48  EdLin: I was scared it would be like the iPaq, a dead mobile platform.
07:48  EdLin: torchie, no, its not.
07:48  torchie: really?
07:49  EdLin: torchie, it isn't HVGA.
07:49  torchie: sources! sources!
07:49  EdLin: !g palm pre 2 resolution
07:49  torchie: I see HVGA everywhere
07:49 @Securabot: 10,500,000 results | News for palm pre 2 resolution | Palm Pre 2 made official: 1GHz processor, 5MP camera, glass screen ... @ http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-2-made-official-1ghz-processor-5mp-camera-glass-screen | DailyTech - Palm Pre 2 Officially Unveiled, Comes up Seriously Short @ http://www.dailytech.com/Palm+Pre+2+Officially+Unveiled+Comes+up+Seriously+Short/article19931.htm
07:49  EdLin: ugh, its HVGA!
07:49  EdLin: fail
07:49  torchie: yeah
07:50  torchie: pre 2 is really just "getting the pre right" before moving on to the SUPER DEVICE
07:50  EdLin: they need the super device, now.
07:50  EdLin: though at least HP can afford to fail for a while.
07:50  torchie: it'd be great to have the super device, on sprint, before christmas
07:51  torchie: my current pre is failing and sprint is android land
07:51  EdLin: torchie, I'm on T-Mobile now, the original Android-land.
07:51  EdLin: torchie, everywhere except AT&T is android-land now. ;-)
07:51  torchie: T-mobile's like super android land, since they don't even have a webos phone
07:52  EdLin: torchie, yeah, T-Mobile doesn't do Palm. I'd kind of given up on them though, and didn't want to pay a deposit to be on AT&T, and needed GSM... So, my options were limited.
07:52  torchie: I thought Palm just doesn't do T-mobile
07:53  EdLin: torchie, I don't know. Who is the ones who are deciding?
07:53  EdLin: that came out wrong
07:53  torchie: maybe in the treo days it was palm's decision
07:53  EdLin: s/is/are/
07:53  torchie: the motorola defy looks like the one slab of silicon that I want
07:53  torchie: ultra durable slate
07:53  EdLin: torchie, I could have gotten an unlocked Treo for cheap a little while ago, as you know, then I'd have had Palm on T-Mobile. :)
07:53  torchie: problem is
07:53  torchie: green robots
07:54  EdLin: torchie, you don't want the Defy, you need good specs to run Android.
07:54  TechnoticRacoon: winphon7 anyone?
07:55  TechnoticRacoon: or am a
07:55  TechnoticRacoon: grr
07:55  TechnoticRacoon: enter fail
07:55  TechnoticRacoon: or am I the only one?
07:55  EdLin: torchie, it runs like butter on my 1GHz Snapdragon. Like trecle on my 528MHz old qualcomm.
07:55  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, you're the only one - WinPho7 needs to reload programs after a screen blank, it has so little multitasking.
07:56  TechnoticRacoon: reminds me of a platform in 07
07:56  TechnoticRacoon: i wonder what it was called
07:56  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:56  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, iPhone had state saving, not winpho7.
07:56  EdLin: and it didn't reload the program after a screen blank.
07:56  TechnoticRacoon: atleast winpho7 has an app store
07:56  torchie: EdLin: the defy has bad specs?
07:56  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, where you can buy a game, and wait 3 minutes for it to load.
07:56  torchie: isn't it above mid range?
07:57  EdLin: torchie, mediocre specs.
07:57  TechnoticRacoon: EdLin: you've used one?
07:57  EdLin: torchie, don't need to, I've seen what Android looks like when it runs Motoblur on a poorly speced phone. My Cliq XT.
07:58  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, ^^
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: :P
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: you
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: grrr
07:58  torchie: OMAP 3610 clocked at 800mhz, that's mediocre?
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: enter fail once mroe
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: more^
07:58  EdLin: torchie, really? I thought it came with something worse.
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: as i was saying you've never used the os
07:58  TechnoticRacoon: so dont judge
07:58  torchie: motoblur is bullshit though
07:59  TechnoticRacoon: i say give it a fair chance, until you get to touch it, then it can be shit
07:59  EdLin: yeah, worst skin on Android sold in the US.
07:59  torchie: I'm so confused
07:59  torchie: like
07:59  torchie: doesn't it take less effort to sell a device with stock
07:59  EdLin: I said that because some KIRFs are worse.
07:59  EdLin: torchie, no product differentiation then.
07:59  torchie: differentiate your product by making it good
07:59  torchie: how about that
07:59  EdLin: torchie, if you sell stock everything, it ends up like Windows, a race to the bottom.
08:00  torchie: but android's a race to the bottom anyway!
08:00  EdLin: torchie, yeah, but a locked-in race to the bottom. At least, that's what the OEMs think.
08:00  TechnoticRacoon: err
08:01  TechnoticRacoon: selling stock builds that havent been touched is goof
08:01  TechnoticRacoon: good*
08:01  torchie: even G2's been touched a little, but it's all we've got
08:01  EdLin: torchie, I know someone who runs a WinMo Treo, and not the Treo Pro either. He runs it because he's used to it, and doesn't want to run anything that's different because that means he would have to learn something new. The OEMs count on that kind of customer.
08:01  TechnoticRacoon: id rather have a copy of windows with nothing, then a dell with object touched
08:01  torchie: wasn't one of the major attractors of the original droid that it ran stock
08:01  TechnoticRacoon: objectdock^
08:02  torchie: EdLin: the kind of customer who doesn't buy another phone?
08:02  EdLin: torchie, if he bought another phone, he'd want one that works like it. Same theory.
08:02  EdLin: torchie, it's why Apple doesn't suck. ;-)
08:02  torchie: android: pretty much windows again
08:03  TechnoticRacoon: um
08:03  TechnoticRacoon: apple has that same theory
08:03  EdLin: TechnoticRacoon, yes, but they want it to be good.
08:03  TechnoticRacoon: meh
08:03  TechnoticRacoon: i say screw windows or osx or linux
08:03  TechnoticRacoon: and make your own damn os
08:04  TechnoticRacoon: same with phones
08:04  TechnoticRacoon: Screw the man!
08:04  Kasm279: heh
08:04  almonds: isnt indian making their own OS
08:04  torchie: apple has the chutzpah to on a frequent basis completely redo something because their market share doesn't come from a tangled web of manufacturers and legacy support
08:04  almonds: india*
08:04  EdLin: Steve Jobs has what is called a Perfectionist-leader personality type, most CEOs have a people-pleasing personality type or if the hatchet-job a psychopathic type.
08:04  TechnoticRacoon: china has their own os
08:04  TechnoticRacoon: same with india
08:04  TechnoticRacoon: :P
08:04  torchie: steve jobs: one of the few CEOs who actually runs the company
08:04  almonds: nokia OS does not count
08:04  torchie: instead of the company running him
08:05  TechnoticRacoon: balmer runs the company
08:05  torchie: no, nokia is the finland OS :D
08:05  EdLin: torchie, cold and unfriendly?
08:05  torchie: finland, unfriendly?
08:05  EdLin: torchie, sure, they're the most laconic country in Europe.
08:06  EdLin: torchie, go to a Finnish bar, the people there drink alone, then go home, without a word said to anyone.
08:06  torchie: "using very few words"
08:06  torchie: what style of "very few words" is this
08:06  EdLin: torchie, right. They might be friendly, but they won't talk to you. Ironic that Nokias have the best talk quality. ;-)
08:06  torchie: is it because they understand body language or something
08:07  EdLin: torchie, no, they just keep to themselves.
08:07  torchie: and aren't afraid to look people in the eyes instead of spending 2 hours fauxting on the train
08:07  torchie: oic
08:08  EdLin: they're like the Russians, except Russians get drunk and curse, and Finns don't even do that. ;-)

08:10  EdLin: fails too
08:10  EdLin: one of these days I'm going to upgrade my PC's keyboard.
08:10  torchie: next pre supports way higher resolution images
08:11  EdLin: I hope so, once you've gone WVGA, you never go back.
08:11  torchie: maaaan
08:11  torchie: go retina
08:11  torchie: go retinaaaaaa
08:12  torchie: palm super device better have retina
08:12  EdLin: torchie, retina is only a little better than WVGA, it has that resolution due to needing HVGA backwards compatibility in terms of aspect ratio.
08:12  torchie: and 1 TB flash memory
08:12  torchie: that's what makes retina so great
08:12  torchie: going from HVGA to retina would be a cinch for palm
08:12  EdLin: torchie, no, WebOS doesn't need anything in terms of aspect ratio. Witness the Pixi.
08:13  torchie: instead of shoehorning into a different ratio
08:13  torchie: but what about native apps?
08:13  EdLin: WebOS is aspect-ratio independant.
08:14  torchie: aspect ratio independent in the standard UI
08:14  EdLin: torchie, native apps gotta get re-written for the new processor anyway a little.
08:14  torchie: but what of the apps developed with C/SDL 
08:14  torchie: hmm
08:14  torchie: fair enough
08:15  LaraX: EdLin: that's interesting about Steve Jobs' personality type... where are you getting this from and are there other perfectionist personality types? I'm a perfectionist but wouldn't say I'm a leader...
08:15 * EdLin enjoys having free Angry Birds though - free apps on Android, ftw.
08:15  torchie: as fun as 16:9 would be though, it wouldn't make for a nice vertical sftware keyboard
08:15  EdLin: LaraX, a friend's book on leadership personality types, name of the book escapes me for the moment.
08:15  LaraX: ok
08:16  LaraX: EdLin: I'd heard about the psycopathic CEO type though, in this documentary about psychopaths
08:16  EdLin: LaraX, most leaders aren't perfectionists. Those that are make a mark on the world, either for good or evil.
08:16  LaraX: it's a good combination
08:17  EdLin: I think so too.
08:17  EdLin: I'm a computer-geek perfectionist, the first thing I do on a stranger's computer is configure everything "properly"
08:17  EdLin: A mac was the first computer that made me feel like I didn't have to do that.
08:17  EdLin: Perfectionism.
08:17  LaraX: that's part of why I like Virgos, they tend to be perfectionists too :)
08:18  EdLin: LaraX, and virgins. ;-(
08:18  LaraX: it can be cute when someone has OCD too
08:18  LaraX: :p
08:18  torchie: well
08:18  torchie: imma go to bed
08:18  LaraX: I wouldn't know...
08:19  LaraX: even on a Mac the first thing I do is configure/customise things
08:20  LaraX: like make the scrollbar arrows separate rather than together
08:20  EdLin: yeah, I tend to do that a bit on a Mac also. I would always make an app stack, but I see Snow Leopard does that by default on a clean installl now.
08:21  Tomis: i just use spotlight menu, configured for just apps
08:21  EdLin: spotlight is too slow for that.
08:21  Tomis: get a modern machine
08:21  EdLin: QS is faster. :)
08:21  Tomis: it's instant
08:22  EdLin: I like the icons anyway. :)
08:22  Tomis: QS has always been too akward for me
08:22  EdLin: QS is too buggy, thats its main problem.
08:22  Tomis: all i ever wanted in an app launcher is exactly what spotlight menu is
08:22  EdLin: Google came out with QSs sucessor though.
08:22  Tomis: search box, results, return to launch
08:23  EdLin: spotlight is too slow, unless you limit it, but sometimes I don't want that.
08:23  Tomis: and i can use the comments field in the finder to assign keywords
08:23  Tomis: cmd-space, game, there's all my games
08:23  Tomis: etc.
08:24  EdLin: you play games on a Mac?
08:25  EdLin: I mean, why put up with Cider, Steam's lame ports, and WoW, and even then get a limited selection?
08:25  Kasm279: tremulous
08:25  Kasm279: warsow
08:25  EdLin: not to mention that until recently, Macs had very lackluster GPUs.
08:25  Kasm279: basically all of the OSS games
08:26  EdLin: torchie_pre, hi
08:26  Kasm279: speaking of such

09:21  richardcavell: How do I select a 'screen saver' that is entirely blank?  I'm on 10.6
09:22  richardcavell: There are plenty of screen savers but I can't seem to find one that is entirely black
09:25  Tomis: just set the display to sleep instead of running  screen saver?
09:26  LaraX: then he can't see the time, if he uses that
09:26  richardcavell: Wait I found a black screensaver online
09:27  richardcavell: Yeah I want the time
09:27  Tomis: meh, screensavers are a waste of electricity
09:28  LaraX: it's better than having a separate clock
09:28  richardcavell: http://www.dr-lex.be/software/screensavers.html
09:28  richardcavell: 8 kilobytes.  It's also 64-bit compatible.
09:33  LaraX: richardcavell: that screensaver is a good idea. now I just wonder if there's a way to get seconds in the clock and get it to stop moving around the screen or something, and just have one big clock as the screensaver
09:34  LaraX: clock/time
09:35  richardcavell: I think you'd have to code your own
09:35  LaraX: oh
10:00  richardcavell: Does anyone here run BOINC on OS X?
10:04  richardcavell: Branes: you there?
10:08 * Branes is hither and yon
10:09  richardcavell: Branes: Mate I just installed BOINC and downloaded some number crunching stuff.  My screensaver was running and iDefrag was defragging my Time Machine.  Battery fully charged, AC power plugged in.  Then suddenly, power turns off like a system halt.  system.log shows nothing.  I think BOINC might be to blame.
10:10  richardcavell: It's annoyed the crap out of me because now my Time Machine is unusable!  Disk Utility won't repair it either
10:15  Branes: You should *never* try to defragment a Time Machine volume, doubly so if Time Machine is still running.
10:15  richardcavell: No TM was not running, the volume was not mounted
10:16  Angostura: I tried defragmenting my time machine volume.
10:16  Angostura: ... I melted my external drive
10:16  Angostura: whoops
10:16  richardcavell: Angostura: serious?
10:16  Angostura: Very much so
10:16  Branes: Your Time Machine archive is corrupt, and there aren't any repair tools to fix it. Erase the drive, start over.
10:16  Angostura: A fairly old Lacie Extreme
10:17  richardcavell: One of the things I like about the hard disks I use for backing up is that they're slow
10:17  richardcavell: very reliable and slow
10:17  richardcavell: 5400 rpm
10:17  richardcavell: I used to have a very fast 7200 rpm thing
10:17  richardcavell: was unreliable
10:17  richardcavell: especially if I moved it while writing to the disk
10:18  Angostura: Coming in late - you have a corrupt TM backup?
10:18  richardcavell: Branes: As to BOINC, if it's going to cause system halts, I'm getting rid of it.  Do you think that was the cause?
10:18  richardcavell: Angostura: Hang on I'm doing surgery on it.
10:18  richardcavell: I was running iDefrag on the TM disk when the computer just halted suddenly
10:18  Angostura: Never had any problems with BOINC here
10:18  EdLin: richardcavell, time to start over.
10:18  Branes: No, BOINC would not have been the cause of it - it would have been your attempt to defragment the TM volume.
10:19  richardcavell: Branes: But I've done that many times
10:19  richardcavell: iDefrag unmounts the volume before defragging
10:19  Branes: Never *EVER* defrag a TM drive.
10:19  richardcavell: So it wasn't recognized as a TM
10:19  Branes: Doesn't matter.
10:19  richardcavell: Why not Branes 
10:19  Angostura: richardcavell: I had the same issue with iDefrag... just before  the drive eventually failed
10:19  richardcavell: Listen, if it wasn't mounted, the OS shouldn't have known that I might use it as a TM
10:19  Branes: Because TM backups are made up of hardlinks and direct physical sector addressing.
10:20  richardcavell: Branes: Are you sure about that?
10:20  Tomis: why would defragging break hardlinks
10:20  richardcavell: Looks to me like the backups have a proper directory structure
10:20  Angostura: it wouldn't
10:20  richardcavell: I've successfully restored to a previous point in time from a TM disk that I fully defragged several times over
10:20  Tomis: really, the question is why *would* you want to defrag your backup
10:20  Tomis: who cares
10:20  Branes: Ask Coriolis, they warn you in the docs to never defragment any volume used for Time Machine.
10:21  richardcavell: Tomis: defragging forces it to rewrite the tracks so they don't decay
10:21  Angostura: ?
10:21  Tomis: oh this again
10:21  Branes: Dude. Modern hard drive technology does not decay.
10:21  EdLin: Time Machine is consumer-grade backups anyway. If you need that kind of reliability, use something else.
10:22  Angostura: Well, hang on a second... it does decay. 
10:22  Angostura: ... but the sun will probably have gone nova
10:22  Branes: Unless you're going to stick it in a gamma bath or keep your hard drive next to half a kilo of strontium 90, hard drive magnetic media does not decay.
10:22  Angostura: so that's the least of your worries
10:22  richardcavell: Branes: Version 2 of iDefrag is safe to use on TM volumes - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:VjVyfvrRP3UJ:www.coriolis-systems.com/iDefrag.php+idefrag+time+machine&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au&client=firefox-a
10:23 * Angostura moves his box of strontium 90
10:23  Branes: My argument still stands -- never *EVER* attempt to defragt a volume used for Time Machine.
10:23  Angostura: ... based on what, Branes?
10:24  richardcavell: Look, these Coriolis people know their stuff
10:24  richardcavell: I've been really impressed with their documentation and the robustness of their software
10:24  richardcavell: if they say it's safe, I'm saying it's safe
10:25  EdLin: richardcavell, that may be so, but if you need defragmented backups, maybe Time Machine isn't the answer for your use case.
10:26  richardcavell: EdLin: Okay, look, I've saved my TM volume from death.  Even if I hadn't, I have backups of my backups.
10:26  Branes: At least you're sensible enough to do *that* :)
10:26  richardcavell: But back to my original question: Is BOINC responsible for the system halt?
10:27  richardcavell: The only other time I've ever had something like this was when I unplugged a printer that was printing, and the laptop just shut off and spat the dummy
10:27 * EdLin gets back to updating the Android ROM on his HD2. :)
10:27  Branes: Most likely not. That said, you may have managed to exceed CPU load capability and the CPU itself initiated a safety halt. Those kinds of events will never be recorded in any log.
10:27  Angostura: richardcavell: BOINC is unlikely to be responsible
10:28  EdLin: what is BOINC?
10:28  Branes: Some distributed processing thingy
10:28  EdLin: !g BOINC

10:28  Angostura: A framework that lets you run distributed processing - Folding at Home, SETIathome and the like
10:28  EdLin: eww
10:29  Angostura: basically donate your CPU cycles for science
10:29  richardcavell: I've set BOINC to run only when CPU usage is < 25%, and to use maximum 80% CPU time
10:29  EdLin: donate your fan and your motherboard to science.
10:29  Angostura: EdLin: You can set the max cpu utilisation
10:30  EdLin: Angostura, kind of silly considering how fast a PS3 or GPU can do most of these sorts of things.
10:30  Angostura: EdLin: Not kind of silly if you don't have a PS3
10:31  EdLin: Angostura, the statistical probability of you getting the result, rather than the guy with the PS3, is pretty low now.
10:31  richardcavell: EdLin: How much faster is the PS3?
10:31  EdLin: !g PS3 fold-at-home

10:32  EdLin: it completes a work-unit in 8 hours.
10:32  EdLin: one of those can take a week on a PC.
10:34  richardcavell: Hmmm
10:34  richardcavell: But the FAQ says that the work units are optimised for the Cell
10:34  richardcavell: It's getting about 20 Gigaflops
10:34  richardcavell: My brand new i3 does about 6.5 Gigaflops
10:35  EdLin: I see. 'tis still faster.
10:36  EdLin: an old joke is that the PS3 is only good for running fold-at-home and playing Blu Rays. ;-)
10:41  salamandyr: anyone know if a way around the 6gb+ ram limit (kernel panics) with macbook pro 5.1's was discovered?
10:44  Branes: EdLin: Not too far from the truth, considering eight PS3's can out-compute twenty-four 2.4 GHz quadcore Xeons.
10:44  Branes: salamandyr: first I've heard of that, got any more detail?
10:45  richardcavell: Branes: I think though that the work units are specialised.  The Cell is not a general purpose computing device.  The work units that are sent to the PS3 are specially selected for it.
10:45  salamandyr: ya, first unibody versions of macbook pros and 2nd of macbooks could support 6gb ram officially, though their chipsets suggest 8gb support
10:45  cYmen: I think I may have uninstalled the DVD player software. What is it called again?
10:45  salamandyr: but running 8gb causes kernel panics
10:46  salamandyr: cYmen:  DVD Player
10:46  cYmen: hehe
10:46  richardcavell: cYmen: It's called DVD Player
10:46  Branes: richardcavell: No, there is nothing special about DC work-units, they are handed out on a first come first served basis, irrespective of platform.
10:46  richardcavell: Now that's not true
10:47  richardcavell: they are selected
10:48  Branes: The Cell BE is actually an exceptionally good general purpose computing device, it's why Sony initially made linux available for it, which led to the development of the Gravity Simulator and the US Department of Defense building superclusters out of PS3s because they turned out to be much cheaper, much more powerful and completely compatible with their current POWER systems.
10:48  richardcavell: Not the same as having 8 x86 cores
10:49  Branes: The main reason why Sony pulled linux support from the PS3 is because the DoD got greedy.
10:49  Branes: Oh, goodness no, eight x86 cores can't keep up with a single Cell.
10:49  Branes: And I'm talking raw computing power, not pattern folding dist-comp stuff.
10:49  richardcavell: I just put in a feature request to iDefrag requesting an option to give the drive a break every so often
10:50  richardcavell: well raw computing power doesn't count
10:50  cYmen: damn, doesn't work if I install an update
10:50  cYmen: no idea where my os dvd is
10:50  richardcavell: I mean, GPUs are terrific at pumping out textured triangles, but you can't use them to do word processing on
10:51  Branes: Raw computing grunt *does* count, rich, why else do you think Apple are working hard to piss Intel off and make their own RICSC chips?
10:51  Branes: *RISC
10:52  richardcavell: If your theory is correct and they're developing ARM chips, the ARM chips will be general purpose computing devices
10:52  Branes: And it definitely counts when you can buy an IBM server with a POWER5 in it that on a single, dual-core 3.0 GHz chip, it can maintain over 100 x86 virtual machines -- each with equivalent computing power to a 2.0 GHz single core Pentium 4 -- without struggling
10:52  richardcavell: any GPU/parallelization function will be tailored to the function
10:53  richardcavell: eg graphics, physics
10:53  richardcavell: Branes: give over
10:53  richardcavell: A POWER5 can virtualise over 100 x86 virtual machines?
10:53  Branes: Yup.
10:53  richardcavell: It would have to emulate them
10:53  Branes: No, it's handled at the chip level.
10:54  richardcavell: I don't believe you
10:54  Branes: Fine, don't. But go stick your head in a big datacenter or colocation outfit some time. You'll see the IBM logo all over the place.
10:55  Branes: POWER5 and POWER6, with its PowerVR technology on-chip, runs x86 better than a native x86 chip can.
10:55  Branes: And unlike Intel, IBM make sure they eliminate microcode faults before shipping.
10:56  Branes: There hasn't been an Intel processor released in the last fifteen years that has not had *at least* six microcode execution faults burnt into the silicon mask.
10:56  Branes: The Core i7-860 has over thirty, and by Intel's standards, that's considered acceptable.
10:57  richardcavell: well wait for the next stepping
10:57  richardcavell: I don't believe that POWER5 can run x86 code faster than a native x86 processor
10:57  richardcavell: although in a manner of speaking the last native x86 processor was the Pentium Pro
10:58  richardcavell: Well I'm going to blame iDefrag for the system halt anyway, since my poor drive had been running for 12 hours at that point
10:59  richardcavell: And I made a feature request - especially for non-SMART drives - to let the drive cool down every so often
11:00  richardcavell: I agree, though, that Intel are sloppy with their processor design.  I don't believe that microcode updates should be a standard part of computing
11:00  richardcavell: It's like software updates.  When I was a boy, there was no Internet to download software updates.  You eliminated the bugs before the software shipped, full stop
11:01  richardcavell: Now, they shift the software 2 months early and rely on early adopters to be the beta testers.  It's a standard part of the business model.

14:04  Blink7: hi all
14:04  Blink7: does anyone know of a way to switch the display of my macbook pro to my cinema display
14:05  Blink7: i don't want to use both, just switch to the bigger screen
14:05  Blink7: now i have to sleep the macbook pro everytime before i can use it together with the big screen
14:06  Blink7: i used to have a program called Insomnia X which allowed me to close the lid of the mbp without going to sleep, while i plugged in the cinema display everything worked perfectly
14:06  Blink7: but since a new update it's not working anymore
14:06  Blink7: does anyone know of another way?

16:15  PigFlu: why is is that when i search my external HD, i can only search on content, not filename?
16:15  PigFlu: annoying as hell
16:30  Branes: PigFlu: try Devon Technology's EasyFind, a freebie which does the opposite.
16:37  PigFlu: what?
16:38  PigFlu: and why cant my mac search by filename?
16:42  Branes: Because Spotlight is hopeless in that regard.
16:44  ChrisAM: PigFlu ... you can use terminal... find . -name '*string*'
16:45  PigFlu: ...
16:45  PigFlu: why did i ever buy a mac
16:45  ChrisAM: dunno
16:47  ChrisAM: I can search file names in Finder.
16:47  ChrisAM: I don't ever use spotlight.
16:48  PigFlu: i can search file names too, but not on my flash drive
16:48  ChrisAM: lemme try
16:48  osxdude: why don't you click the "File Name" button in the top toolbar?
16:49  osxdude: and all my drives spin up (even CD drive) when I use Spotlight
16:50  osxdude: like so: http://www.osxdude.com/screenshots/20101024094948.png
16:50  osxdude: argh
16:50  osxdude: stupid webserver not working
16:51  ChrisAM: PigFlu ... working fine here
16:51  PigFlu: oh wait.
16:52  PigFlu: the window was too small, the button wasnt showing
16:52  PigFlu: -__-
16:52  osxdude: lol
16:52  ChrisAM: why did you ever buy a mac?
16:52  osxdude: yea; it's right there. :P http://75.63.61.37/~osxdude/Screen%20shot%202010-10-24%20at%209.50.32%20AM.png
16:52  ChrisAM: heh... I was just about to post a screenie
16:52  osxdude: yea that took a bit of work too
16:53  osxdude: since my webhost is currently sliced
16:53  __name__: Wait.
16:53  __name__: It finds mail messages?
16:53  osxdude: Apparently!
16:53  __name__: Scary.
16:53  osxdude: Why scary?
16:54  __name__: They want to sell you Corsair RAM!
16:54  osxdude: isn't it your computer?
16:54  osxdude: bwaha
16:54  __name__: How can it find mails if it searches by "file name".
16:54  __name__: That doesn't make the slightest sense.
16:54  osxdude: Oh
16:54 --- nullobj_ is now known as nullobj
16:54  osxdude: good point...
16:54  osxdude: I think Finder just assumes File Name = Email Subject
16:55  __name__: That's odd.
16:55  __name__: That's probably the magic Jobs keeps talking about ☺
16:55  osxdude: heh
16:56  __name__: Why isn't there a 13" antiglare MBP anyway?
16:57  osxdude: Can't you choose matte or gloss?
16:57  osxdude: matte being antiglare
16:57  __name__: Nope, only with the 15"/
16:57  __name__: And that one is both too expensive and big.
16:57  osxdude: yea.
16:58  __name__: 1900 (with the antiglare) is just too much.
16:58  __name__: *EUR
16:58  osxdude: :/

17:15  Branes: __name__: It's because screens with the polycarbonate front (aka CrystalView) are both cheaper and more study than their antiglare alternatives
17:17  Branes: Add to that the fact that those 90% are TV-brainwashed mouth-breathers with the intelligence of a concussed duckling who believe everything they're told, so therefore think (and I use that word loosely) 'vivid' is 'better'.
17:18  __name__: Shame there's no 13" antiglare mbp.
17:32  panosru: hello
17:32  panosru: does anyone uses Parallels?
17:32  panosru: I was wondering if it is possible to mount the debian virtual hard drive into osx in order to access it through finder :
17:32  panosru: :/
17:38  jeffszusz: panosru: i doubt that'd be a good idea since it's not a real hard-drive
17:39  jeffszusz: though if the virtual machine is RUNNING you can share everything with samba or NFS
17:39  panosru: jeffszusz: depends on the use you needed, for the use I need it is a good idea :)
17:39  jeffszusz: and see it all in finder as if it's on a network computer.
17:39  panosru: I tried to connect with SFTP but for some reason I have some issues :S
17:40  jeffszusz: what do you want to do with it?
17:41  panosru: I have set a debian installation with apache/php/mysql because OSX is crap for web development :D
17:41  jeffszusz: lol
17:41  jeffszusz: so you want to be able to put files in WWW
17:41  jeffszusz: sftp is one of the best solutions for that. what was giving you troubles?
17:42  panosru: the only reason I did that is because osx don't respect case senstivity and people here told me to not format my hard drive with case sensitivity because nothing will work :P
17:42  panosru: for some reason I get some permission issues when Zend Studio tries to write some SVN info on the project :/
17:43  panosru: and also I connect to sftp through transmit
17:43  jeffszusz: is zend studio trying to login to the machine as root or as another user?
17:43  panosru: and mount it as a disk since if I type ftps:// I'm prompt to login but I get errors even if I type the user name and pass properly
17:43  jeffszusz: because your regular user in linux won't have permissions for the /var/www folder or whatever
17:44  panosru: zend studio uses the mounted disk that transmit create using root user
17:44  panosru: yes I know, I'm using root user not regular :)
17:44  jeffszusz: mounted disk that transmit creates? what?
17:46  panosru: transmit has an option to mount your sftp
17:46  panosru: as a disk
17:46  panosru: which is very handy
17:46  jeffszusz: weird
17:48  jeffszusz: which debian do you have installed - is it just a server or is it equipped with gnome?
17:48  panosru: the most weird is that when I try to connect through finder with ftps://10.211.55.3 I get prompt to login and even if I type root as username and the password that I use I can;t connect
17:48  panosru: jeffszusz: not it is a server, Debian Lenny (5)
17:48  panosru: since I use Lenny for production servers too and I'm very familiar with it
17:48  panosru: and I didn't installed any X servers on it since I don't need any graphical appearance I need only the shell :D
17:49  panosru: works great I can browse my vhosts without any problem my only problem is to mount a hard drive on my OSX that will point to /var/www or to /
17:49  panosru: same for me
17:50  panosru: and when I try to connect with ftps through finder I get this message:
17:50  panosru: There was an error connecting to the server “10.211.55.3”. Check the server name or IP address, and then try again.
17:51  namidark: panosru: why not use nfs?
17:52  panosru: namidark: nfs can't connect at all :/
17:52  namidark: panosru: why? 
17:52  acovrig: does anyone know how to disable the trackpad button on a macbook?
17:52  panosru: its not that I want ftps only, I would use anything in order to connect :P
17:52  namidark: sounds to me like you have a firewall issue
17:53  panosru: namidark: hmmm let me check something now that you mentioned firewall
17:53  namidark: panosru: completely disable the firewall, then try
17:54  panosru: namidark: still the same :/ I turned off firewall from preferences
17:54  Branes: acovrig: short of disconnecting it electrically (which would also stop the internal trackpad, internal keyboard and power button from working) it's not really possible.
17:54  namidark: panosru: not on mac, on your lenny box :p
17:54  namidark: sorry for not being clear
17:55  namidark: also for nfs, do you have the appropriate daemons? and if you're insisting on using nfs, do you have your certificate installed?
17:55  namidark: daemons started***
17:56  panosru: namidark: lenny don't have any firewall installed, and sorry but I'm familiar with nfs protocol so any help is appreciated :)
17:56  namidark: familiar or unfamiliar :)?
17:57  namidark: panosru: on your lenny box, what happens when you run ` rpcinfo -p `
17:58  iaj: hmm hey dudes... can anyone tell me what I have to do to change MacVims :!echo $PATH path?
17:58  panosru: can't contact portmapper: RPC: Remote system error - Connection refused
17:58  namidark: panosru: so you need to start the nfs daemons
17:58  namidark: panosru: im not familiar with lenny but a quick google shoudl show you how to
17:59  namidark: should be something like mountd, nfsd, portmapper
18:01  panosru: namidark: ah seems that I haven't installed nfs at all :S
18:01  namidark: ;)
18:03  namidark: panosru: you could be even fancier, and edit stufff on your mac, and export your mac's nfs to your server and mount it from there
18:03  namidark: exporting nfs on mac is *super* easy
18:04  panosru: namidark: any link please? :D
18:04  panosru: sounds good!
18:04  namidark: http://bluescripts.net/2010/09/ruby-on-rails-nginx-and-passenger-setting-up-the-ultimate-development-environment/ -- look at first few lines
18:04  namidark: apps in my case was the directory where all my web stuff was
18:06  panosru: namidark: "Thankfully on mac it is ridiculously easy to setup NFS" I feel baaaaaad!!!! hahahahah
18:07  namidark: :)
18:07  namidark: i had to research it too :p
18:07  namidark: mac has it easy though, just one line in your exports and your done
18:09  namidark: and then you shouldnt need to install any nfs stuff on your lenny box
18:09  panosru: namidark: do I need that webmin thing?
18:09  namidark: should just be able to mount it
18:09  namidark: no ignore the rest
18:09  namidark: thats for a ruby/rails environment
18:09  panosru: ok cool
18:10  namidark: well some of it might pertain if you wanted :p i made it so if i have a folder called foobar, i can go to foobar.dev and it'll load up the app
18:10  panosru: namidark: ah this is your blog?
18:10  namidark: *shameless plug* lol
18:11  namidark: only thing webmin was for was setting up the BIND dns server locally, beause well, i have editing text files for dns -.-
18:11  panosru: :P
18:11  namidark: hate**
18:12  panosru: btw since before you told me about nfs, I installed it in my lenny virtual box and tried to connect just out of curiosity and still I can't connect :P
18:12  panosru: so anyways I will proceed with the other way from the link :D
18:14  namidark: yeah doing it from server to mac is easy, i think it started in 10.5.x they  made it super easy to export nfs
18:14  namidark: obviously change your IP etc to match yours
18:16  panosru: yeah
18:16  panosru: namidark: this seems to be correct to you ? /Users/panosru/Sites/web_projects/      -rw -mapall=root -network 10.211.55.2 -mask 255.255.0.0
18:16  namidark: yup
18:16  panosru: because when I run showmount -e I get errors
18:16  namidark: uhm
18:17  panosru: I restarted nfsd
18:17  namidark: wait
18:17  namidark: sorry
18:17  namidark: -network 10.211.0.0
18:17  namidark: change that then restart nfsd
18:18  panosru: ok did it and still I'm getting  "Cannot MNT RPC: RPC: Program not registered can't connect socket for RPC" when I execute showmount -e :/
18:18  panosru: sorry for taking your time btw
18:18  namidark: locally?
18:18  panosru: yeah :D
18:18  namidark: wouldnt be irc if i was worried aboutt ime lol -- try restarted nfsd a few times
18:19  panosru: lol
18:19  panosru: kk
18:19  namidark: restarting**
18:19  namidark: any luck?
18:19  panosru: yeah!!!
18:19  panosru: Exports list on localhost: /Users/panosru/Sites/web_projects   10.211.0.0
18:20  namidark: :)
18:20  namidark: then on oyur lenny box
18:20  namidark: cd /home or wherever
18:20  namidark: mkdir sites
18:20  namidark: mount -t nfs YOURMACIP:/Users/panosru/Sites/web_projects sites
18:20  panosru: ok so I moved /var/www to /var/www_bk
18:20  namidark: ok so it would be
18:20  namidark: cd /var
18:20  panosru: and I will mount www into /var right ?
18:21  namidark: mount -t nfs YOURMACIP:/Users/panosru/Sites/web_projects www
18:21  panosru: cool
18:21  panosru: lets try :D
18:22  panosru: unrecognized mount point www :P
18:22  panosru: oh
18:22  panosru: lol
18:22  panosru: w8
18:22  panosru: :P
18:23  namidark: :)
18:23  panosru: I forgot to mkdir www
18:23  panosru: but now I'm getting:
18:24  panosru: mount.nfs: 10.211.55.2:/Users/panosru/Sites/web_prjects failed, reason given by server: no such file or directory
18:24  panosru: oh stupid!!!!! web_projects ! not web_prjects! :P
18:24  panosru: lol
18:24  namidark: ill let you look at that for a second
18:24  namidark: lol
18:24  panosru: seems to works let me do a test to check something
18:25  panosru: ah
18:26  panosru: seems that it uses the case sensitivity of the mac :(
18:26  namidark: unix does
18:26  namidark: thats not a mac thing
18:26  namidark: if you want case insens go to windows :O? or reformat your mac os
18:26  panosru: yeah I mean it don't uses case sensitivity :(
18:27  panosru: no I want case sensitivity
18:27  namidark: oh
18:27  panosru: thats why I installed debian
18:27  namidark: o,0
18:27  namidark: is your mac case insensitive?
18:27  panosru: yes :(
18:27  namidark: ew
18:27  namidark: howd you manage that?
18:28  panosru: I wanted to reformat it to be case sensitive but people here told me that by default mac is case insensitive and if I format it to use case sensitivity it will brake lot of things
18:28  panosru: do you have case sensitive mac?
18:28  namidark: yeah, it was default...
18:30  panosru: and it works well?? you don't have any problems right ?
18:30  namidark: no?
18:30  namidark: *nix is case sensitive
18:30  panosru: crap :S shit :P
18:31  panosru: pfff I will check again the nfs
18:31  panosru: maybe I could mount /var/www to osx somehow
18:31  panosru: how can I remove the /var/www now without removing the files form the original place?
18:31  panosru: umount?
18:34  panosru: ok I did it :) so now normally if I finder I press command + K and use nfs://10.211.55.3 as server address shouldn't it connect to lenny?
18:38  Kasm279|Away: panosru: mihgt be easier just using SMB :P
18:41  panosru: Kasm279|Away: installing smbd now on lenny to try it
18:41  panosru: :/
18:41  panosru: what a f... day :S
18:42  panosru: you know the best part? :P the project have to be online tomorrow and it is for French bank populaire and NRJ radio :D
18:42  panosru: lol
18:43  Kasm279|Away: heh
18:47  panosru: Kasm279|Away: I installed smb daemon on lenny and now when I try to connect from my osx to lenny through smb I promted to enter username and password, I enter them correct but I'm getting message of invalid username or password :S
19:38  cryptic0: have you guys noticed a popup window in the new firefox (3.6.11) that asks permission for incoming network connection if you try to download something.  The popup is erratic and disappears after one second or so.
19:38  EugeneKK: Hi, do you guys know of any software that allows to use a monitor connected to a windows computer  as a secondary monitor for mac (hope this made sense )?
19:38  cryptic0: not a software, but you could use a KVM switch
19:39  cryptic0: a piece of hardware 
19:39  EugeneKK: eh, was thinking of something easier. 
19:39  Marvolo: Using a piece of software would be much slower since it would probably be over the network.
19:40  Marvolo: Hardware is the way to go in this situation.
19:40  Ballresin: Dual input monitor?
19:40  EugeneKK: Marvolo, I am aware of that, not a biggie. Easiest but not free solution would be a minidv to dvi/vga converter...
19:42  EugeneKK: by the way, here's one solution I found on google if anyone is interested: http://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html

22:14  Tomis: os 9
22:15  acous: definitely os9
22:15  Kasm279: i don't have it on OS9 >.>
22:15  Tomis: you also didn't know it came with mac os x
22:15  Tomis: lol
22:15  Kasm279: i tried using it on 9
22:15  Kasm279: and i had to download it
22:15  Kasm279: >.>
22:15  Tomis: meh, doesn't matter
22:15  Tomis: it's not coming with macs anymore now
22:16  Tomis: it's funny that apple apparently woke up and went "why are we supporting these 3rd party crap technologies? let's drop that shit"
22:16  diffract|: u talking about java?
22:17  Tomis: yup
22:17  Tomis: i wonder what other cruft they'll drop
22:17  Tomis: when are they going to diconnect carbon from life support already
22:18  sgfgdf: i did understand the move with the flash, but can't understand this with the java.
22:18  acous: they should drop ipv4 already
22:18  Tomis: it's the same with java sgfgdf 
22:18  Tomis: it's someone else's tech, it's slow, it's crap, it's a pain in their butt
22:18  Tomis: let said other company be reponsible for it
22:19  Tomis: apple's always been slow to update the java vm, their early love of java wore off rather quick
22:22 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
22:22  sgfgdf: Tomis: one of the reason i liked the mac was that it wasn't necessary to think about nstalling java vm or everything else related to it. i just run what i want. so now i'm disappointed.
22:27  sgfgdf: it will be interesting if google one day decide to deny access to their google maps service to each iphone, and cut all their applications using it. i'm getting to be not happy user because of these companys wars.
22:27  S_SubZero: it makes perfect business sense for Google to do that, certainly.
22:29  sgfgdf: may be the fashion now is when someone build something new you should build it too. not watch your business, ut watch everyone's other and copy them.
22:32  sgfgdf: i would not be surprised if milk build their own smartphone or better - a search engine like google.
22:32  sgfgdf: *milka the chocolate
22:33  acous: mmm chocolate smartphone
22:36  torchie: milka the chocolate?
22:36  torchie: is that some kind of code
22:37  sgfgdf: torchie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milka
22:38  torchie: milka the chocolate smartphone?
22:38  torchie: wat
22:38  torchie: wot
22:38  torchie: wut
22:42  sgfgdf: torchie: it was just in theory.
22:47  sgfgdf: hah, http://www.flickr.com/photos/frasers/5104179782/sizes/l/in/photostream/
22:54  S_SubZero: what does chocolate have to do with iphones.. who in their right mind would handle an iphone after eating chocolate
22:54  Kasm279: i would if my hands were clean
22:55  S_SubZero: if your hands are clean right after eating chocolate, you're doing it wrong sir.  8P
22:55  Kasm279: no, you are doin it right :P
22:57  KeeperOfTheSoul: ok, that was plain odd, iPad just showed the apple logo and nothing else
22:57  KeeperOfTheSoul: sat there like that for 5 minutes then turned back on
22:57  S_SubZero: M&M's I'll give an exception since they dont melt in your hand but seriously
22:57  Tomis: isn't that the boot image KeeperOfTheSoul ?
22:57  Tomis: it doesn't take that long to boot up though does it
22:58  KeeperOfTheSoul: if it is, they could at least animate it
22:58  Kasm279: KeeperOfTheSoul: black screen
22:58  Kasm279: glass apple?
22:58  KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah
22:58  Kasm279: yeah, boot screen for ipods
22:58  KeeperOfTheSoul: heh, been so long since I saw the boot screen must not have recognised it
22:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: wonder why it rebooted itself :s
22:59  osxdude|iPad: were you scrolling in Photos? lol
22:59  osxdude|iPad: that causes random reboots for me sometimes
22:59  Tomis: lol
22:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: nope, watching bbc iplayer
22:59  Tomis: that should never happen
22:59  osxdude|iPad: well...
22:59  osxdude|iPad: ...it does
23:00  osxdude|iPad: lol
23:00  Tomis: perhaps that's how it deals with kernel panics
23:00  Tomis: it just reboots
23:00  Kasm279: i started up the Reteurs app on an iPad
23:00  osxdude|iPad: that's what I figured
23:00  Kasm279: and scrolling on it lagged terribly
23:00  Kasm279: osxdude: that happen with yours?
23:00  osxdude|iPad: the rebooting or lagging?
23:00  osxdude|iPad: that's a per app thing
23:00  osxdude|iPad: the lagging I mean
23:01  Kasm279: do you have the reteus app?
23:01  osxdude|iPad: depends on the app
23:01  osxdude|iPad: nope lol
23:01  Kasm279: reteurs*
23:01  Kasm279: thr thing is, its not a complex app
23:01  Kasm279: just basically a site speciofic browser
23:01  Kasm279: with a page written for the iPad
23:01  osxdude|iPad: heh
23:01  Kasm279: but it still lagged terribly
23:01  osxdude|iPad: interesting
23:01  Kasm279: bad first impression tbh
23:02  osxdude|iPad: yea that's the app
23:02  Kasm279: the tech deck game was kinda fun though
23:02  Kasm279: the thing is, that app was loaded on as a demo app
23:02  Kasm279: and its an app that shouldn't have lagged like that
23:02  osxdude|iPad: indeed
23:03  osxdude|iPad: one app that is quite laggy is the Amazon app
23:03  osxdude|iPad: keyboard comes up slow lol
23:03  Kasm279: i liked the web browser and the keyboard though
23:07  kalusn: hey, how do i use the shortcut ^ with an _ above
23:07  kalusn: ctrl + ??
23:07  Tomis: yea that's the control sign
23:07  Shaded: hi osxdude 
23:08  kalusn: yeah but there is an underscore above the control sign
23:08  Shaded: hi the_rogue_smiler 
23:08  kalusn: overscore
23:08  Shaded: hi xid 
23:09  kalusn: you know what im talking about Tomis 
23:09  kalusn: ?
23:10  Tomis: what's the issue kalusn 
23:11  kalusn: i have a textmate bundle shortcut (latex) described by an ^ with an _ above it
23:11  Tomis: ah huh
23:11  Tomis: and we already covered that it means control
23:11  kalusn: ^ means ctrl
23:12  kalusn: ^ with an _ above it obviously doesn't
23:14  osxdude|iPad: o.o
23:14  osxdude|iPad: hi shaded
23:14  osxdude|iPad: lol
23:17 --- Tomis2 is now known as Tomis
23:20  kalusn: Tomis: i can tell you that the shortcut ^ with an _ above it is fn + enter. thanks for the help though :)
23:22  Tomis: ahhh
23:22  crilly: aaah indeed
23:22  Tomis: yea sorry, i realized what you were talking about but i got distracted by a phone call
23:23  crilly: Does he mean the symbol for Pi?
23:23  crilly: π?
23:23  Tomis: lol
23:23  kalusn: π
23:23  kalusn: nah not this )
23:23  crilly: What the hell is ^ with a _ above it?
23:23  kalusn: http://blog.macromates.com/2007/textmates-many-key-shortcuts/
23:24  kalusn: its the shortcut symbol for fn + enter
23:24  Tomis: why, it's enter of course crilly 
23:24  crilly: Oh I see.
23:24  kalusn: but its kinda hard to search for a symbol on google you know :)
23:25  Tomis: could search the character palette if you have it in text form
23:25  Tomis: sometimes the symbol descriptions are useful
23:26  kalusn: how do i find those?
23:28  Tomis: system prefs>keyboard>show menu item
23:30  kalusn: thanks!
