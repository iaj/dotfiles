00:00  b3ny0-: yeah I wouldn't want to wait on that to render on a laptop
00:00  b3ny0-: :)
00:00  CPng|N: finally a "real need" for superior hardware. lol
00:00  diffract|: i rendered similar graphics on my laptop
00:00  CPng|N: well did you read it. It uses the GPU so you don't have to wait (as much)
00:00  diffract|: i was kinda impressed
00:00  diffract|: but the laptop was about to cry
00:00  CPng|N: you could do it, but you could do it even faster on desktop HW
00:00  b3ny0-: it sure is possible on a laptop, but it takes time
00:00  CPng|N: yeah, nice n toasty hot
00:00  apn: diffract|, painful bokeh on some of them.
00:01  CPng|N: "no other software makes use of it in the way that Octane does. With a single, modern, GPU you can typically expect to see a 1000%-5000% (10X to 50X) speed increase over a typical un-biased, CPU based renderer."
00:01  apn: diffract|, but classy work other than that.
00:01  diffract|: yeah, so don't go on telling me high-end desktops and GPUs are only used for gaming
00:01  diffract|: there is CUDA and OpenCL now
00:01  diffract|: stop living under a rock
00:02  b3ny0-: games kick ass on a desktop though
00:02  apn: diffract|, sure, if you categorize AIX as a high end desktop. Graphical Station =! Desktop
00:03  alexbobP: I use my high-end gpu for cracking passwords
00:03  alexbobP: (also for gaming)
00:04  Condoulo: My GPU isn't really high-end. :( nVidia 7600GT with 256MB of graphics memory. Main reason I'm using it over my ATI Radeon HD2600XT 512MB (which also isn't high-end but better) is ATI drivers for Linux = crap
00:04  apn: b3ny0-, no more kick ass than playstation 3, just 5 times the money
00:04  b3ny0-: FPS sucks ass on consoles
00:04  b3ny0-: and that's like 90% of what I'm playing
00:05  alexbobP: consoles just suck ass
00:05  apn: Condoulo, true that. Nvidia do have better drivers.
00:05  b3ny0-: they wouldn't be able to charge as much for a console because its hardware is ancient
00:05  Condoulo: Yup. Its a shame because I really really like the Hardware AMD/ATI has to offer. 
00:05  alexbobP: apn: if you take the pricetag of a PS3 and invest it in a graphics card, that card will kick the SHIT out of the ps3's graphics
00:05  apn: b3ny0-, that means your screen sucks, as that's what makes the limits.
00:05  b3ny0-: the 360 has been unchanged for 5 years
00:05  b3ny0-: what does my screen got to do with the controls?
00:06  apn: alexbobP, really? tell me one game that can't handle ps3 :-)
00:06  apn: alexbobP, or vice versa, sorry
00:06  b3ny0-: I already own the only proper console
00:06  b3ny0-: Nintendo Entertainment System ;D
00:07  diffract|: OpenCL isn't mature enough yet too.. so that's one advantage of using nvidia cards, they support CUDA which is more mature
00:07  diffract|: unless you don't care about programs with graphics acceleration
00:07  apn: b3ny0-, and I'm told that I am living under a rock :-)
00:08  b3ny0-: you don't make any sence
00:08  b3ny0-: last time I checked you used keyboard and mouse to play games with, or in your case, a gamepad
00:09  alexbobP: apn: are you kidding me?  it's a locked down platform, it can't run very many games at all
00:09  alexbobP: apn: minecraft or nethack for example... pretty low system specs, but the ps3 can't run them simply because it only allows big gaming houses to publish for it :P
00:10  apn: alexbobP, it can run nethack
00:10  alexbobP: apn: the ps3 can't handle crysis, which is apparently the standard pop-culture way to measure gaming power :P
00:10  alexbobP: apn: how do you run nethack on a ps3?
00:10  apn: alexbobP, sony recommends installing linux on ps3
00:11  alexbobP: apn: sony also removed the ability to install linux on ps3 :P
00:11  b3ny0-: they made Crysis 2 uglier so it can run on consoles
00:11  alexbobP: lol
00:11  b3ny0-: hooray for advancements
00:11  apn: alexbobP, hehe, the times changed for the past 3 years I guess :-)
00:11  diffract|: yeah, too bad games are dumbed down on PC just so they can run on consoles
00:12  alexbobP: apn: yeah... I'd be a lot happier with sony if they still had the linux option
00:12  diffract|: but then there is more money on console games than PC
00:12  alexbobP: anyways I totally agree with diffract| and b3ny0- 
00:13  b3ny0-: you can't run mumble on a console either
00:13  b3ny0-: how am I supposed to communicate with my teammates
00:13  alexbobP: I say, to hell with gaming consoles!  And to hell with iphone for the same reason!
00:13  alexbobP: If I am going to even *consider* buying computing hardware it has to be MINE to run software on.
00:14  apn: alexbobP, I am not a gamer, so I relied on informations that I knew were true. I was not aware of the change. Wrong move I guess on their part.
00:14  alexbobP: apn: yeah... well the reason they did that was because hackers were getting close to giving linux full access to the ps3's hardware
00:15  alexbobP: apn: and their misguided and futile effort to stop piracy is more important than the basic rights of their users
00:15  b3ny0-: can you still run folding@home on it?
00:15  alexbobP: to, eg, keep running software that was a major marketing point when they bought their computer.
00:15  apn: And what's the problem? Wasn't that _hacker's personal hardware_?
00:15  alexbobP: b3ny0-: doubt it.  not if that ran on linux.
00:15  alexbobP: apn: by my reckoning yes
00:15  apn: alexbobP, yeah, class action!
00:16 * apn pulls out a fork and puts a hey hat on his dirty heir.
00:16  b3ny0-: racing and fighting games are more fun with gamepad I admit
00:17  b3ny0-: but a gamepad for fps is like giving someone a fork to eat his soup with
00:17  diffract|: they say FPS with gamepad and mouse is better than with keyboard and mouse
00:17  diffract|: don't know if that's true
00:17  apn: b3ny0-, what's the problem with hooking a keyboard and mouse to a console?
00:18  b3ny0-: what's the point is more my question
00:18  diffract|: where are you gonna put the keyboard?
00:18  apn: diffract|, to play the game the way you want?
00:18  b3ny0-: and do you sit at a desktop with your computer?
00:18  b3ny0-: console*
00:18  apn: diffract|, in usb port?
00:18  b3ny0-: sit in a sofa with mouse and keyboard = awkward
00:18  b3ny0-: and potentially dangerous for your poor spine
00:19  diffract|: apn: you still need a table to put the keyboard on, you're not gonna carry it as you're playing.. you might as well just use a desktop PC to play the game
00:19  apn: sitting too much is a potentially dangerous for your spine, and mouse for your wrist
00:19  alexbobP: apn: I hope that class action suit goes well for the plaintiffs
00:19  b3ny0-: yeah well, its not gonna help making it even worse ;)
00:19  apn: diffract|, while desktops are more expensive to play the same game
00:19  alexbobP: apn: it would be a true miscarriage of justice if sony learns that it's perfectly okay to sell people features and then take them away
00:20  diffract|: apn: fair enough
00:20  apn: alexbobP, you understand that if theirs go well, xbox, apple, microsoft, and other bigs are going under it also. Right?
00:20  alexbobP: 17:19:22 < b3ny0-> sit in a sofa with mouse and keyboard = awkward
00:20  alexbobP: not really, I do it all the time with mouse and laptop...
00:21  alexbobP: apn: lol, xbox = microsoft
00:21  alexbobP: apn: I don't see how apple and microsoft would be guilty of the same thing though
00:21  b3ny0-: you have to be ultra-precise and fast all the time you do that?
00:21  apn: alexbobP, true. I made a hasty mistake.
00:21  alexbobP: Sony marketed the "
00:21  alexbobP: other os" feature and then removed it
00:22  apn: alexbobP, the same policy. apple with it's itunes stores and firmware breaking jailbreaks. Microsoft with zune, etc.
00:22 --- Psycho is now known as Psy|
00:22  alexbobP: apn: I don't quite see the similarity
00:22  alexbobP: but Apple and Microsoft getting sued sounds awesome, so bring it on!
00:23  apn: alexbobP, that's easy. apple and microsoft advertise music to be able to play in all the devices. This is not true due to DRMs. False advertisement.
00:23 --- remyo_ is now known as remyo
00:24  alexbobP: apn: ipod and zune can play drm-less music...
00:24  apn: alexbobP,  they can, but what about music that you lend (not buy as advertised) from itunes store or zune?
00:25  apn: can you play it in, let's say, xmms? :-) Or sansa fusion?
00:28  apn: So quiet all the sudden.
00:28  alexbobP: apn: I'm all for suing drm-encumbered music stores
00:28  alexbobP: I don't buy from any of those :P
00:28  alexbobP: but let other people sue them
00:28  alexbobP: for the lulz
00:29  apn: alexbobP, the same situation with ipod touch/iphone. Limiting your usage of the hardware and purposely destroying devices (jailbreaked, but that's not their business) is just criminal act.
00:30  apn: apn, good thing Mac is still reasonably uncontrolled by itunes store.
00:31  b3ny0-: man this filtatron app
00:31  b3ny0-: what a time killer
00:32  apn: hehe
00:33 * apn things it got quiet because somebody wants to track me for what I said and the police is on the way already...
00:34 * apn better leaves.
00:34  Branes: ... paranoid much?
00:43 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
00:48  Gryllida: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/821885 , the user can't install Firefox on Mac (neither 3.5.x nor 3.6.10)
00:49  tos9: Gryllida: Console says... ?
00:51  Gryllida: where?The user didn't launch anything from Console as far as I can say
00:52  Gryllida: tos9: ^
00:52  tos9: Gryllida: I'm sure they didn't, but it'd contain any error messages potentially.
00:53  Gryllida: ok
00:53  Gryllida: where can it be opened?
00:53  Branes: Their Mac is being too clever, it knows Firepig is a dangerous slug of a piece of software and wants its pet human to keep using Safari.
00:53  tos9: Gryllida: It's in Applications/Utilities (or just spotlight Console.app if you know how)
00:53  Branes: And that noise they describe is a normal user-interface sound effect.
00:54  Branes: So, the Firefox icon has been successfully copied into /Applications.
00:55  Branes: They need to now open the Applications filder, and find the Firefox icon they just copied, and double-click on it to launch it -- it's icon should then appear in the Dock.
00:55  tos9: Heh. Or that. My imagine-that-sound machine isn't as good as yours I guess. I wouldn't describe it as a "boing". To me it sounds like some modern electronic door closing or something
00:56  Branes: MacOS X might have a much much simpler way of installing programs than any other OS, but it's still not beginner-proof.
00:56  Gryllida: Branes: Ah.
00:57  tos9: Branes: It's only not beginner proof because people are used to coming from the hell that is Windows installation land.
00:58  Branes: tos9: it needs some kind of default folder-action, if you drag a new app to /Applications, you should get a little dialogue box asking "Would you like this added to the Dock?"
00:59  Gryllida: ok
00:59  Gryllida: How to open the Applications folder?
01:00  tos9: Branes: Meh, step forward for new users, step backward for old ones. I hate workflow disruption. Maybe a growl notification. Or just once the first time a user does it.
01:00  Gryllida: ok. the user did that and says that 'the bouncing firefox icon appeared on the dock'. should it be bouncing?
01:00  Branes: Click on the desktop once to make the Finder active, press Command and N to open a new window. the Applications icon should appear in the sidebar. Click once.
01:00  Branes: Yes
01:00  Branes: You need to buy a second-hand MacBook and learn OSX, Gryllida :)
01:00  Gryllida: :D
01:01  tos9: Gryllida: The user might benefit from http://www.apple.com/findouthow/mac/
01:01  tos9: They've got some short videos that you can skim on a bunch of basic things
01:01  tos9: (and some not so basic ones)
01:01  Gryllida: tos9: I'll suggest that, once he installs the application three Apple technicians failed to install for him after which he headed to Firefox live chat support, where I'm on the helper side
01:02  Branes: Gryllida: Last thing both of you should know: hold the control key and click (or right-click) on the new Firepig icon in the Dock, and from the menu that pops up select "Keep in Dock."
01:02  Gryllida: " OK, a new box appears after I clicked the Firefox icon in the dock.  It gives me 3 option tabs:  "Show Web Page", "Cancel", and "Open". "
01:03  Branes: I've no idea what that's about.
01:04  tos9: Me neither, but it doesn't sound like he ctrl-clicked the icon.
01:04  Branes: What's meant to happen, is if you click the Dock icon and the program is not running, it starts the program, and if the program *is* running, it selects it.
01:06 --- luist_ is now known as luist
01:06 * Gryllida makes the user hit cmd while clicking the icon
01:06  tos9: *ctrl* :)
01:06  torchie: sup dawgs
01:10  Branes: Yo dawg, we heard you like yo-yos and Yo Dawgs so we put the yo-yo Yo Dawg in a yo-yo so yo' can yo-yo yo' yo-yo Yo Dawg while yo' yo-yo yo' Yo Dawg yo-yo Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg while yo' yo-yo Yo Dawg yo-yo dawg yo-yos, dawg.
01:14  diffract|: this isn't rizon
01:14 --- bluethundr_ is now known as bluethundr
01:15  Branes: I know. I just like to make yo-dawgers' heads explode trying to figure that out :)
01:15  Gryllida: (8:42 AM) Gryllida: the difference is that now you must be holding the cmd key pressed while left clicking it
01:15  Gryllida: (8:44 AM) Beth: OK, did that, and when I did, the whole screen went blank (our chat history), and only the dock bar appeared.  On that bar, the Firefox icon lit up with 'hide, quit, 'and one other option.  So now what?
01:17  Branes: At this point, I'd stop trying to install that severely-substandard program pretending to be a browser, and go back to sticking with Safari.
01:17  fleebailey33: ff is horrible
01:17  Gryllida: ... leaving the user unknowing how to install any applications
01:18  fleebailey33: i use safari
01:19  Branes: The program is installed, what Beth says is happening should not be happening.
01:19  fleebailey33: who's beth
01:22  Gryllida: the user
01:22  Gryllida: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/821920
01:25  torchie: woo saffary
01:25  Al2O3: Is there a tool to turn PDF files containing TIFF images (one per page, this is a book scan) into a PDF indexable that is also much smaller?  OCR tool?  Something that will maintain format and font (or an approximation)?
01:26  Angostura: Indexable?
01:26  Al2O3: Yes, where I can search the file for words, phrases.
01:26  Al2O3: Searchable?
01:26  Angostura: Ummm, you said it contained TIFF images
01:26  Al2O3: Yes.
01:27  Angostura: Got it
01:27  Angostura: hang on
01:27  Al2O3: Thanks.
01:28  Angostura: Here's your problem....
01:28  Angostura: You can either use an OCR to convert it into text and make it indexable
01:28  Angostura: or
01:28  Angostura:  you can leave as an image and keep the format and font
01:28  Angostura: The two are inimicable
01:29  Angostura: unless you convert to text and then reformat yourself
01:29  Al2O3: Yah, I wanted to find a tool that would do a fine job of formatting while doing the OCR as well.
01:29  Al2O3: Basically turning it into a text document in PDF, and getting rid fo the bulk involved with the TIFF images in the PDF container.
01:30  Al2O3: That would be ideal.  These documents are 800+ pages each, and I have 12 of them.
01:30  Al2O3: Way way too much work involved to do formatting.
01:30  Angostura: I don't believe such a tool exists, but I might be wrong
01:30  Angostura: Are they formatted in a particularly fancy way?
01:31  Al2O3: Well, as fancy as books are formatted I guess.  They are online for DL here...  http://www.mediafire.com/?i7dyb90388awj
01:31  Al2O3: A few of them are very large, and they are from the 50s, 60s and 70s.
01:32  Al2O3: So nothing special really, just insanely large and tedious to work with as PDFs go with TIFFs.
01:32  Al2O3: Would be great to make them into 4-5 meg instead of 200.
01:32  Angostura: Just downloading to take a peek
01:39  Al2O3: TY, I'll await your thoughts on how best to approach this with tools available either OS or potentially commercial/shareware.
01:39  Al2O3: less money involved, the better for me.
01:42  Al2O3: I'm wondering if DjVu is the direction one might seriously consider on this project to convert PDF containers with TIFF page scans to searchable PDF documents
01:44  Gryllida: once an application icon has been added to desktop, what's the proper way to launch it?
01:44  Gryllida: to dock**
01:45  tos9: Gryllida: Single click will open it
01:45 * Gryllida hopes so
01:45  Al2O3: Double click on dekstop, single click on dock (still a problem for some, and a long time argument on how SJ blew it with the doc in OSX )
01:46  Al2O3: Most people I know still double click the doc when launching an app by clicking on its dock icon.
01:47  Marvolo: I use Quicksilver to launch apps independantly of files. Sometimes however i'll drag a file to the dock to open it with a specific app
01:48  Al2O3: I do as well, I hardly click on apps on the doc.  QS has been and still is my fav OS X app, should be part of the OS however SJ and company would bastardize it so I'm glad it is an indie app.
01:49  Al2O3: Branes: can we finally change the name of this channel to 'Bash the SJ back to Indie'?
01:50  aaron42: i remember the days when apple would bring indie stuff in-house and it wouldn't suck
01:50  aaron42: the clock in the menubar was a shareware app under system 7
01:51  aaron42: i guess that died once and for all when they stole sherlock rather than buying it
01:52  tos9: aaron42: required reading: http://www.nucalc.com/Story/
01:52  Al2O3: Well, now its time to compare apple to MS.  In this light of taking what isn't theirs, if true, they are worse than M$ since at least when caught M$ paid out 100s of millions (for instance the compression software) they stole.
01:52  aaron42: ah, i've read that
01:52  salamandyr: anyone know a subwoofer-only solution as an add-on for a current imac?
01:52  aaron42: yow
01:52  aaron42: anyone ever notice grounding issues with laptops?
01:52  Al2O3: Yes, I have read that too.
01:53  aaron42: if i touch my old pbg4 and my air at the same time i get a mild shock
01:53  Al2O3: aaron42: I have grounding problems with all kinds of apple products, and also other manufactures.  I have minis that zap me each time I touch them.  Or maybe I zap them, but it hurts me either way you look at it.
01:53  Al2O3: I get the crap shocked out of me with apple/mini products.
01:53  aaron42: the two laptops seem to be at different grounds
01:54  aaron42: hmm, they are plugged into different outlets
01:54  aaron42: could be different circuits
01:54  Marvolo: salamandyr: there is this http://store.apple.com/us/product/TY274ZM/A but it isn't as powerful. it's the only stnadalone subwoofer i could think of
01:54  aaron42: i should change that
01:54  Marvolo: The only zapping problem i get with apple products is the slight 'vibration sensation' of touching the back of my ipod while it's in the dock
01:54  aaron42: i remember my g3 tower used to shutdown if i touched the headphone jack while i was charged (like from carpet in the winter)
01:55  salamandyr: Marvolo - thanks.  that might be enough - i'm just looking for a wee bit more to spread the singal. 
01:56  salamandyr: e.g. it's loud enough but the imac's speakers get muffled on the low end
01:56  aaron42: anyone know anything about macbook air fan issues?
01:56  aaron42: i can't get the fan to speed up, either under os x or under bootcamp xp
01:56  aaron42: i can read the speed and temperature, but it won't go over 1000rpm
01:57  aaron42: and in windows it heats up bad enough to spontaneously shutdown
01:57  aaron42: is this a hardware issue?
01:57  salamandyr: does it stay pegged at 1000rpm?
01:57  aaron42: no
01:57  salamandyr: could be a hardware issue, yes.
01:57  Marvolo: have you reset the SMC?
01:57  aaron42: yes
01:57  salamandyr: on windows, could be driver issues
01:57  aaron42: smcfancontrol under os x doesn't work either
01:58  aaron42: it reads the temp and speed, but doesn't seem to change them
01:58  salamandyr: but i had a fan go bad in a macbookpro - one of the two seized and would just run at < 1000 rpm for a few weeks before it finally died.
01:58  Marvolo: When the computer does not get any temperature data, it speeds the fans up to full speed just in case. This explains what happens during your Windows sessions.
01:58  aaron42: nope
01:58  salamandyr: he said it heats up and shuts down under windows
01:58  aaron42: full speed is 6200
01:58  aaron42: it never gets anywhere near that
01:58  Marvolo: Oh I misread
01:58  aaron42: i wish it would
01:58  salamandyr: how many fans?
01:58  salamandyr: in an air
01:59  aaron42: 1 i think
01:59  aaron42: i can burn myself on the q & w keys
01:59  salamandyr: ya.. i'd back it up and get it fixed - prob hardware
01:59  Marvolo: I can't imagine that there is much air in that form facter, so only 1 fan would seem sufficient
02:00  salamandyr: or back up and do a clean install first to convince yourself it's hardware
02:00  salamandyr: heh
02:00  aaron42: yeah
02:00  aaron42: i desperately need a clean install anyway
02:00  salamandyr: macbook air.  now with less air.
02:00  Marvolo: Boot from your Install CD and see what happens
02:00  aaron42: the main install i run is slow as shit
02:00  salamandyr: well, 2gb ram...
02:00  salamandyr: it'd be a great linux machine
02:00  salamandyr: :)
02:00  Marvolo: If you can boot from a CD..
02:00  aaron42: tho i have a clean install on an external drive i use for performance critical stuff
02:00  aaron42: and i've tried the fan stuff on that one and it's no better
02:01  aaron42: i expect what i need is a long session at a genius bar
02:03  nchase: anyone here do psx emulation on the mac?
02:04  CPng|N: wow I havent' tried PSX emu since that old PC app
02:04  nchase: :)
02:04  remyo: PSX as in playstation?
02:05  nchase: remyo: yeah
02:05  CPng|N: PS 1?
02:05  remyo: Wow, memories
02:05  CPng|N: yeah really
02:05  nchase: CPng|N: yeah
02:05  nchase: yeah!! heh heh
02:05  CPng|N: can't you get most of those games as Flash games now? lol
02:06  nchase: no way :)
02:06  remyo: Yeah, not even close
02:06  nchase: there are so many classics for the psx!
02:06  CPng|N: for PS1? pshh
02:06  remyo: nchase: Final Fantasy Tactics (my favorite PS1 game) is coming out for the iPhone 
02:07  CPng|N: well if it runs on an iphone it could run in flash on a computer
02:07  nchase: remyo: potentially my favorite ps1 game too. wow that's amazing
02:07  remyo: Yey :D
02:07  nchase: remyo: I wonder if it'll still be fun. It'll be amazing if they get the interface to be nice to use on a touch screen
02:07  nchase: I'll have to buy it :((((
02:07  nchase: no choice in the matter really
02:08  Al2O3: aaron42: My MBP 17" goes to 80000+ all the time.  Sounds like the freaking thing is going to fly away.
02:08  Al2O3: 8000+
02:08  remyo: nchase: I had At War with the Lions on PSP and it was REALLY great. From what I hear is it's just going to be a touch centric port of that
02:08  nchase: remyo: sweet, been wanting to play that. i should read up on it and see exactly what's new
02:09  remyo: nchase: Well as far as the PSP version. A few new characters, two new jobs, a ton of new items / quests and better translation. Less Engrish
02:09  CPng|N: ah so
02:10  nchase: awesome awesome. the items/quests will be exciting to me. i see it had multiplayer on psp? if they have that on iphone, i'm way more than sold :))
02:10  remyo: For real
02:11  remyo: For some reason I think MGS1 would be really fun on an iPhone too
02:37  nchase: remyo: heh! i was thinking about that game today. and yeah, if they got the controls right it'd be excellent
02:38  remyo: Well they could stick a dpad and buttons on the screen like they do with other ones
02:46  baba_b00ie: *yawn* hows everyone doin
02:47  CPng|N: and a bababooey, to you all
02:47  baba_b00ie: heh 
02:48  remyo: doin' awesome
02:48  baba_b00ie: whats the word on mac front ? i've been lost in the linux world to long
02:49  remyo: Armed guards have seized are Macs. We're all being made to use iPads now
02:49  remyo: our* Macs
02:49  baba_b00ie: oh i'm sorry. ipads... eww
02:49  baba_b00ie: samsung galaxy 
02:50  remyo: Actually theres a "Back to Mac" event tomorrow. And they're suppose to announce some cool stuff. Including 10.7
02:50  baba_b00ie: haha sorry, it's the linux guru in me again.. i've actually used the ipad a bit a few days ago. they're not all that bad. just pricey
02:50  baba_b00ie: 10.7? beta or final ?
02:50  Branes: Apple are on the threshold of become the richest company on the planet and linux tweakers are still trying to put their abomination onto toothbrushes :)
02:50  remyo: Apple doesn't hold events for Betas. 
02:51  Branes: It's just an announcement that 10.7 is coming. And it'll be the last OSX.
02:51  baba_b00ie: beta or in the works.. whatever... thats what i meant. 
02:51 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
02:51 --- Psy| is now known as psycho
02:51  remyo: Branes: What makes you say it'll be the last?
02:52  Branes: Steve wants to bring iOS to the desktop.
02:52 --- psycho is now known as Psy|
02:52  remyo: :\ Nevermind
02:52  baba_b00ie: Branes, we've had this discussion about a year ago.  iyou said sometring along the lines of mac users use their machines.. linux/windows people spend most of their time tweaking not using
02:53  remyo: Any sentence that beings with "Steve wants to" I'm not buying 
02:53  baba_b00ie: Branes, the last OS X ? 
02:53  baba_b00ie: whats gonna happen to os x after 10.7 ?
02:53  b3ny0-: you know all linux/windows-users out there?
02:54  remyo: baba_b00ie: I don't think anyone here really knows
02:54  Branes: remyo: Combine that with inside knowledge, that large numbers of programmers have been shifted away from OSX to work on iOS and add to it a lot of the functionality OSX currently enjoys.
02:54  Branes: 10.7 Lion will be the last of the big cats, it'll have its two years in the field, and be supplanted by a much-expanded, more powerful iOS.
02:55  remyo: That makes more sense 
02:55  remyo: I love the current iOS but it could hardly replace OS X
02:55  Branes: Well, they do share the same heart :)
02:56  Branes: Springboard will be the first thing a new Mac user sees, with Finder relegated to the utilities folder, and it'll ship without any commandline access installed by default (but you can get all that back once you install iCode)
02:57  robgleeson: speculation, speculation :)
02:57  remyo: Some things I prefer iOS for. Like reading, listening to music, etc. Content consumption. But it's sooo not there as far as contnet creation yet. 
02:58  remyo: iCode :) I like that
02:59  Branes: Yeah, it'll be true when we see it happen :) but as well as what I've gleaned from my worms in the Apple, and observing Apple's (and Steve's) approach to things for thirty years, my speculation has a high chance of becoming reality. Along with the shift away from Intel.
02:59  baba_b00ie: personally i think the pc world and the mac world are going to merge to a devices market. i think they'll have "devices" that you use to browse the web and then devies for play. my thinking is similar to what they have in the star trek universe. 
02:59  baba_b00ie: maybe you'll have a phone that is your portable swiss kniff. but then you'll have these netbook-ish devices for the web/email or whatever then you'll have your gaming "devices" for uh games hehe
03:00  remyo: Branes: Is the shift away from Intel something you've heard or just your personal wishes? :p
03:00  baba_b00ie: i also think the shift to cloud is whats gonna kill the home pc market. may it be pc/mac.windows
03:01  Branes: remyo: The former, combined with what I see has already happened.
03:01  baba_b00ie: hasn't anyone noticed in the last 10 years or so. the serious lack of freeware.shareware that once was available has dwindled to near nothingness ? not like the 80's or 90's especially by any means. should be interesting what the next 10 /20 years brings us in computing
03:01  remyo: A4?
03:02  Branes: The A4 is part of the transition, yes.
03:02  remyo: baba_b00ie: I wasn't using computers in the 80's or 90's. Sorry :(
03:02  Branes: It's more a proof-of-concept than anything else.
03:02  ChrisAM: baba_b00ie ... The number of open-source projects has gone up.
03:02  robgleeson: the back to mac event is today right?
03:03  remyo: robgleeson: If it's wednesday for you, yes
03:03  robgleeson: oh sure, 2AM on a wednesday :))
03:03  remyo: robgleeson: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/10/liveblog-apples-back-to-the-mac-event-107-preview.ars
03:04  Branes: It's supposed to kick off in about 15 hours
03:04  remyo: 15 hours to go
03:04  remyo: Heh...
03:05  baba_b00ie: ChrisAM, not sure if OSS has gone up or down or not. but i think apple amd microsoft platforms have largely been defending themselfs by 1st party and LARGE 3rd party guys. not so much of the ma and pa programming in the basement like years ago
03:05  robgleeson: are apple broadcasting the event?
03:05  sr0z: They always time their events while I'm on my way to work :/
03:05  ChrisAM: There are several very good independent OS X software houses.
03:05  Branes: Apple haven't 'cast a live event themselves for years.
03:05  remyo: robgleeson: They usually upload it on the site after-the-fact
03:06  robgleeson: Branes: well, for the "iPhone 4 incident" they did ;)
03:06  robgleeson: okay
03:06  robgleeson: I'll wait for that, then.
03:06  robgleeson: I don't like watching the live picture streams on engadget, etc.
03:06  baba_b00ie: what was the iphone 4 incident you're talkinga bout robgleeson ? 
03:06  robgleeson: the antenna issue.
03:07  baba_b00ie: i thought that was after the fact they discovered the issue 
03:07  robgleeson: it was.
03:07  robgleeson: I don't think they ever admitted it was an issue either, but an issue with all smartphones.
03:08  baba_b00ie: lol yeah i don't think they actually adittd to it. but they said it was a problem since the first generation of iphone
03:08  ChrisAM: it wasn't an issue, so to address the non-issue, they gave everyone free bumpers
03:08  baba_b00ie: and also pointed the finger to motorola and rim
03:09  baba_b00ie: i think moto, rim and htc all fired back at apple or something too. saying yo we don't have that problem.. lol something like that
03:10  robgleeson: no idea. I don't own an iPhone 4 :)
03:10  remyo: The couple of iPhone 4 owners I know never had to get bumpers :|
03:10  baba_b00ie: either do i.. i'm all about incredible myself
03:11  baba_b00ie: remyo, the only iphone 4 user i know had to grab the bumper. he showed me how the 'non-issue - issue' really killed the signal. and it did
03:11  remyo: baba_b00ie: Meh. I was never able to duplicate it 
03:12  remyo: I wonder how much of it depends on the coverage in the area 
03:13  baba_b00ie: me neither. but my friend was and showed me. took full signal down to 2 bars. then he would remove his hand full signal again
03:13  baba_b00ie: remove his hand from his head* and in front of him i should add
03:16  remyo: The ohter big rumor thats been floating around is a Verizon iPhone. 
03:17  Marvolo: You know why rumors float around?
03:17  Marvolo: They have no substance
03:17  remyo: I don't disagree
03:17  Marvolo: I just made that up
03:18  Marvolo: anyway, i only believe something after it's been released. i try not to pay attention to any rumor mill sites
03:18  remyo: Good
03:18  Marvolo: I didn't even know Apple was making the iPad until they released it
03:20  baba_b00ie: Marvolo, lol funny. i knew about it months in advanced. i like to read up on rumors but tend to ignore them until final product if any is released. keeps the disappointment to a min...
03:21  remyo: I kind of agree with Marvolo. It kind of kills the surprise when you already know about something
03:22  Marvolo: I'm not reading anything about the next Zelda or Pokémon B+W in hopes of having a totally new experience when i actually get the game
03:22  Marvolo: </nerd revelation>
03:22  remyo: B+W?
03:23  remyo: Ah, Black and White probably
03:23  Marvolo: yup
03:23  remyo: They ran out of colors?
03:23  robgleeson: lol
03:23  Marvolo: and gems

03:39  _Marvolo: hold on endra 
03:39  falcom: if a iphone is unlocked / jailbreak does that mean it can be use in any valid phone carrier with out a dataplan?

04:09  John____: can someone verify if I need to jailbreak my iphone to do this procedure? http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=4974
04:11  LSD`: As near as I can tell, it doesn't actually touch the phone, but rather operates on the backup files maintained by iTunes on your computer so you shouldn't need a jailbroken phone for it
04:12  koro: obviously
04:12  koro: your iphone could no longer exist, and you still could do this
04:16  John____: lolwut
04:16  John____: i got the program now
04:16  John____: i dont need my iphone at all, i just need the backup which is on my mac
04:16  koro: no shite!
04:18  John____: wow, amazing
04:18  John____: I got this program to finally discover the passcode my idiot friends set up on my iphone restrictions
04:19  John____: I no longer need to do a restore of my iphone, this is just amazing
04:19  John____: I cannot thank enough joako who told me about this marvelous page yesterday and tell me the directory to where the passcode is hidden in

05:23  LaraX: I hope so :)
05:24  LaraX: anyway, this finally works!
05:24  tanner: what does?
05:24  LaraX: my internet connection
05:25  tanner: oh
05:25  tanner: osx86?
05:25  LaraX: I waited 5 hours this morning for gmail to load, now 4G finally works
05:25  LaraX: no
05:25  LaraX: I'm on a PC/Vista for now because my Mac hard drive died
05:26  tanner: sad days
05:27  LaraX: yeah, but Apple will make some announcement tomorrow, maybe a new MacBook Air
05:27  jeffmr: :( 
05:27  tanner: here's to hoping
05:27  tanner: i find the idea of a 11" mba for $999 quite appealing
05:27  LaraX: me too
05:27  tanner: doubt its that cheap though
05:28  LSD`: lol, have they actually suggested it's going to be USD$999? My money's on it being in the same ridiculous pricing area as the old model
05:28  tanner: i could actually see apple pose the MBA to replace the MB
05:29  LaraX: or the iPad
05:30  tanner: as much as people think they want it, i dont see a ios+osx device to be produced by apple, ever
05:30  LSD`: LaraX: ugh, no
05:31  LaraX: LSD`: no what? the iPad was supposedly going to be like their netbook but most people don't like it, the MacBook Air would be better
05:31  LSD`: if "most people don't like it" why are they still selling like hot cakes?
05:31  LaraX: because some people do
05:32  tanner: i have to admit, this looks pretty sexy: http://www.tipb.com/images/stories/2010/10/metaliphone4.jpg
05:32  tanner: plenty of people love the ipad LaraX 
05:33  tanner: but a lot of people expected it to be something it clearly wasn't
05:33  tanner: and whine about that fact
05:33  LSD`: As I keep saying, the iPad is the first tablet device in 20 or so years of the form factor to be worth a damn
05:34  LaraX: I don't really care, whatever it is, it isn't for me, if others like it that's fine
05:34  tanner: LSD`: precisely
05:34  LSD`: replacing it with an overpriced netbook would ruin that
05:34  tanner: LSD`: it doesn't pretend to be a full computer
05:34  LaraX: EdLin: poke
05:35  tanner: i love how all these people are quoting steve jobs out of context for the conference call
05:36  EdLin: LaraX: hi
05:36  LaraX: EdLin: hi! guess what... 4G is working in NYC now. I'm so happy. it hasn't been announced yet though, they said maybe Halloween
05:37  EdLin: LaraX: cool.
05:37  EdLin: LaraX: I already have HSPA+ on T-Mobile, that's almost 4g....
05:37  EdLin: though I don't have a phone that takes advantage of it past 7.2MBps
05:38  LaraX: EdLin: and this after I spent like 5 hours this morning waiting for gmail to load. Sprint SmartView is lying, it's showing full bars for 3G but then on the button where it asked if I wanted to switch to 4G it only showed one bar for it which is more accurate
05:38  EdLin: wow, 5 hours.
05:39  LaraX: yeah, my internet connection has been so horrible to non exsistant, for weeks - months, you have no idea
05:39  EdLin: sounds like you'd be better off wandering the sidewalk with a wifi dongle.
05:40  LaraX: it's like I had internet, but only for short bursts at a time, and I had to be here manually refreshing pages and reconnecting the card and restarting hoping one of those times I refreshed while there was internet... ugh
05:40  LaraX: now I can finally stop wasting time and do other things
05:40  LaraX: hi remyo
05:40  remyo: LaraX: Hey you, whats up?
05:41  LaraX: remyo: I just got 4G to work! like an hour ago
05:41  EdLin: Apple for a long time had an inaccurate bar measure, they changed in an the iPhone 4 firmware update.
05:41  EdLin: s/the//
05:41  remyo: LaraX: Nice. Fast?
05:41  LaraX: remyo: yeah it seems to be faster than 3G ever was, though I haven't used it much yet
05:42  EdLin: wimax was made for laptops and the like, not phones, originally. should work well for near-stationary uses like you're doing.
05:42  LaraX: and I was using 3G with like one or no bars all this time (Sprint SmartView was lying)
05:42  remyo: What are they going to do when they get to 5g. "Five Gee" doesn't sound cool. 
05:42  LaraX: and it was switching to 1XRTT even today
05:43  EdLin: remyo: it'll be a long time till there is real 4g. (wimax and LTE aren't it)
05:43  remyo: EdLin: Yeah man, but I'm talking about the future
05:43  LaraX: EdLin: the only reason it was being used stationary was my old laptop was so big/heavy, but the next one won't be
05:43  EdLin: LaraX: getting the new MBA maybe?
05:44  LSD`: LTE is the one that has the backing of whatever committee is behind GSM I believe
05:44  LaraX: EdLin: yeah maybe, waiting for the announcement tomorrow
05:44  EdLin: LSD`: true, but it ain't 4g.
05:44  remyo: LaraX: Are you going to be keeping up with the event tomorrow?
05:44  LaraX: and maybe I'll switch to iPhone/Verizon, after I finally got this working...
05:44  EdLin: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4g
05:44  LaraX: remyo: yeah I can now that I have internet again
05:45  LSD`: EdLin: given the amount of fragmentation there, it's just marketing buzzwords anyway
05:45  EdLin: LSD`: 4g is gigabit speed. It's all 3g evolved.
05:45  remyo: I'm kind of excited about 10.7. Then again it occured to me that I really just got my work flow "down" in Snow Leopard. 
05:45  EdLin: LTE = Long-Term *Evolution*
05:45  remyo: Hopefully old stuff will still work
05:47  EdLin: remyo: unless they've resurrected ZFS or done something else to fix the filesystem some I am not excited about 10.7
05:47  LaraX: EdLin: I have this one now: http://shop.sprint.com/NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/DisplayPhones?phoneSKU=FWU6003G4G I like it, the only problem was it didn't have whatever driver it needed in the included CD so they had to download it at the store, the previous card didn't even need that CD, it had the installation software in the card and installed easily on any computer
05:47  LSD`: I think more will break this time than normally due to the lack of developer access, maybe that's what it's about: Apple making something of a formal announcement that they're working on 10.7 and it'
05:47  remyo: EdLin: ZFS would be nice :D
05:47  LSD`: ll take another year or so to be released rather than announcing a release date
05:48  LaraX: EdLin: if this didn't work I was going to try http://shop.sprint.com/NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/DisplayPhones?phoneSKU=SWW8013G4G you were talking about though I preferred the card
05:49  remyo: Branes thinks OS X will just become iOS and vice versa. 
05:49  LaraX: it had a 30 day trial period or something
05:49  LSD`: tbo: http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/os-x-10-7-rumours-and-reality-18363/http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/os-x-10-7-rumours-and-reality-18363/ <- intersting read
05:50  tanner: branes refused to use anything that didnt run PPC
05:50  LSD`: remyo: Branes also believed Apple were on the verge of shifting to AMD CPUs and that AMD actually still make good chips :P
05:51  Branes: AMD my arse. x86 is dead dead dead.
05:51  tanner: so dead it sells billions of chips a year
05:51  remyo: Ugh, sorry. I'll try not to quote people again. 
05:52  tanner: so Branes, who took away your ops?
05:52  LaraX: Branes: what will you do when your current Macs stop working completely and you have no parts to replace them? it will happen eventually
05:52  LSD`: tanner: so dead Intel are on the verge of making an attack into the phone/tablet market, the heart of ARM territory
05:52  Branes: Go find more parts.
05:53  LaraX: one day they won't exist any more
05:53  remyo: LaraX: There are TONS of PPC Macs (and older) on Ebay 
05:53  tanner: LSD`: x86 isn't suitable for low power devices sadly
05:53  Branes: Then I'll go back to pen & paper.
05:53  LaraX: remyo: yeah but you know Apple will change enough things eventually that they won't work at all
05:53  tanner: still have that faraday cage setup Branes?
05:54  Branes: That said, I still have a couple of Apple machines that are older than my childredn and they still run :)
05:54  remyo: LaraX: Why would they stop working? 
05:54  Branes: I'll be dead before the last Mac stops running.
05:54  EdLin: Steve Jobs issued the backdoor rm -rf / command he installed on all Macs.
05:54  LSD`: tanner: http://www.anandtech.com/show/2913 <- Intel are working on it though
05:54  LaraX: remyo: I don't know, but would the first Mac ever still work today?
05:55  remyo: EdLin: Good thing I realiased rm 
05:55  EdLin: LaraX: not with modern software, but Branes prefers OS 8.5
05:55  tanner: LSD`: im fairly confident we'll never see an x86 chip that can compete with an ARM chip on performance per watt
05:55  LaraX: EdLin: so it would still work with that?
05:55  EdLin: which also doesn't run probably on the first mac. :)
05:55  tanner: (in the mobile market)
05:55  remyo: LaraX: One of my clients has a working Macintosh 128k
05:55  Branes: oh, tanner's back I see. If he's back here trolling he must've run out of windows geeks to annoy ... that or he's down to his last neuron :)
05:56  LSD`: tanner: I don't know, if anyone can manage it, Intel can
05:56  tanner: don't feel bad you got busted for being a dick :)
05:57  richardcavell: Are we still going with the theory that Apple is going to have multigigahertz ARM chips within 5 years?
05:57  tanner: LSD`: the thing is, to make x86 work there are a lot of processes that aren't required by ARM devices
05:57  EdLin: remyo: it's a good theory, they're already in the 1.5GHz range
05:57  remyo: EdLin: Huh?
05:57  tanner: you wont see apple switch OS X to ARM
05:58  EdLin: remyo: yep, ARMs are in the labs that run at 1.5GHz.
05:58  LSD`: EdLin: they're still an order of magnitude behind x86 in raw performance
05:58  tanner: being able to run Windows natively on the Mac was a huge boon for sales
05:58  remyo: EdLin: Think you might have been aiming for richardcavell 
05:58  EdLin: LSD`: an order of magnitude behind an i7 is still pretty good.
05:58  EdLin: remyo: oops
05:58  remyo: No problem.
05:58  richardcavell: not good enough though
05:58  tanner: EdLin: an order of magnitude would be like comparing the P3 to the i7
05:58  richardcavell: Apple computers need to compete with Wintel machines
05:59  LSD`: EdLin: not when you want to use it to run regular desktop software. They crumble even under the relatively light weight of cellphone OSs.
05:59  EdLin: tanner: ARMs will be able to do everything their intel counterparts can do today, soon.
05:59  tanner: sure, just considerably slower
05:59  endra: Is safari integrated into the OS?
05:59  EdLin: LSD`: who says you need to run desktop software? Desktop software is unbelievably bloated.
05:59  tanner: components used by Safari are endra
06:00  remyo: endra: Meh. Sort of. Not so mych integrated as it seems to have a lot of hooks
06:00  endra: tanner: I'm not a big fan.. any critical components? I'm looking to remove it
06:00  remyo: Like doesn't iTunes depend on Safari?
06:00  Branes: Safari (the .app) is just a front end to WebKit which is part of the OS.
06:00  LSD`: EdLin: people who think you can just drop an ARM into a regular desktop or notebook and continue on your way
06:00  tanner: dunno if you can 'remove' it, but you wouldnt be removing the system components used by it
06:01  EdLin: LSD`: you can't, but smartphone-like and tablet OSs are going to evolve to the point that people won't care that it isn't Windows eventually.
06:01  Branes: endra: It is best you leave it alone - if you don't like it, don't use it. Besides, if you *do* delete the .app, it will be restored with the next Software Update.
06:01  tanner: EdLin: that isn't Apple's goal
06:01  EdLin: tanner: what's Apple's goal?
06:02  tanner: they can't sell you an iPad and MacBook Pro if theres only one..
06:03  tanner: Apple will continue to use x86 for the foreseeable future
06:03  EdLin: tanner: sure, and Dell and HP have more models of computers than Apple. Doesn't mean Apple will keep on having a product line even this broad.
06:03  tanner: ARM isn't desktop or server ready
06:03  LSD`: tanner: ...because it missed its chance, like most of the non-x86 archs
06:03  EdLin: Apple doesn't care about servers really, except for publicity that OS X is Unix.
06:04  EdLin: well, maybe they care about the new mac mini server. :)
06:04  tanner: besides, being able to bootcamp into Windows is a huge selling point for Macs
06:07  EdLin: tanner: you've got a point. I think though that they'll evolve the iPad until people are getting it instead of a notebook.
06:08  tanner: dont count on it
06:08  LaraX: do you know what time this stuff will be tomorrow?
06:08  tanner: ipad is great for casual use
06:08  tanner: thats about it
06:08  tanner: LaraX: 10am PDT
06:08  LaraX: ok thanks
06:08  remyo: About 13 hours to go
06:08  LSD`: Thinking the iPad, or any slate device, is a replacement for a notebook is wrong. At best, they'll replace netbooks, but there's always going to be a place for "full" computers
06:09  tanner: yup
06:13  LaraX: remyo: have you ever had durian? I tried freeze dried durian for the first time today and it does smell like socks, lol
06:13  LaraX: but it tastes good
06:14  remyo: Yes I have
06:14  LaraX: the fresh one?
06:14  LaraX: I also tried freeze dried jackfruit and mangosteen, also good and the mangosteen might be my favorite
06:14  LaraX: +for the first time tody
06:14  LaraX: a
06:22  remyo: LaraX: Oh yeah, that stuff is awesome 
06:23  LaraX: remyo: which one, fresh durian? have you tried all three?
06:23  LaraX: I'm afraid the fresh one might stink up my apt though I've never smelled it
06:25  remyo: LaraX: When you get it. Eat it. It's kind of a dinner / desert food. So maybe special occasions only?
06:25  remyo: I haven't found a solid way to avoid the smell so I don't keep them unless I'm going to eat them like "that night"
06:26  LaraX: remyo: which one though? I haven't even seen fresh durian in stores but it might be in Chinatown
06:27  LaraX: maybe you can light a candle to get rid of the smell
06:28  remyo: You can't really buy it fresh in grocery stores. I think some organic places do it. When I get it it's usually the same way you do
06:28  FriedBob: Well, first day of work went well.
06:28  FriedBob: Worked 12 hours and 15 min. :D
06:28  LaraX: EdLin: have you seen these fruits in NYC?
06:29  LaraX: remyo: online?
06:29  remyo: Rexibit: I'm here. I'm just back and forth in another channel. 
06:29  remyo: Ah, I mean LaraX ^
06:30  LaraX: I figured :)
06:30  LaraX: FriedBob: that's good
06:30  remyo: Sorry. Do I seem non responsive? :)
06:30  LaraX: remyo: yeah but I knew you were multitasking, I know you don't ignore me for no reason :)
06:30  remyo: Never
06:30  FriedBob: LaraX: Yeah. I think I may wind up w/ OT even w/o working Mon. :)
06:30  EdLin: LaraX: I seem to be having wifi problems, sorry.
06:31  LaraX: EdLin: it's ok
06:31  LaraX: EdLin: you can use my 4G!
06:31 --- tanner_ is now known as tanner
06:31  EdLin: lol
06:32  FriedBob: D'oh! 37.25 hours this week. :(
06:33  EdLin: LaraX: I should try that fruit, if I eat a fruit I haven't had for 12 months, I get to say a special blessing. :)
06:33  remyo: LaraX: Ok, I'm back. Someone wanted me to explain my vim configuration. 
06:33  FriedBob: But, I have to be at work in 7.5 hours, so g'night
06:34  LaraX: good night FriedBob
06:35  LaraX: remyo: ok, so have you tried jackfruit and mangosteen too?
06:35  LaraX: EdLin: yeah you should try all three, I haven't seen them fresh but I haven't really looked either
06:35  remyo: LaraX: mangosteen I've had and I really like. Haven't had jackfruit yet. 
06:36  LaraX: this guy in Brooklyn had mangosteen http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/30/32/30_32mangle.html
06:36  remyo: LaraX: Durian is one of those things that gets better the more you eat it. Try it a couple more times. The smell won't bother you as much and it'll even taste better. 
06:37  remyo: Fresh Durian tastes better but it's generally harder to find and more expensive. It doesn't keep long which is why they usually freeze it 
06:38  LaraX: EdLin: do you know this place? it says "the only market in the city where you can get these extremely rare purple orbs is the Orchard, a gourmet greengrocer on Coney Island Avenue in Midwood"
06:38  EdLin: LaraX: next time I'm in Midwood, especially if it's before a holiday, I'll try to look that place up.
06:39  EdLin: LaraX: I have been on CIA in Midwood before, but don't remember that store. I shop at the Jewish religious articles stores there sometimes.
06:39  LaraX: EdLin: ok, I haven't been around there in years
06:40  LaraX: EdLin: I've heard there are organic coconuts in Brooklyn so might have to go for that too
06:40  EdLin: LaraX: yeah, it's practically right next to them, near Ave J. Apparently the OJs in Midwood like fancy fruit too.
06:40  EdLin: LaraX: Eichlers is on that block
06:41  remyo: LaraX: Did you know if you type "fresh durian" in Google the second suggested result is "fresh durian nyc"
06:41  remyo: :D
06:41  LaraX: remyo: no I didn't look yet, I just got internet back a few hours ago and got out of the habit of being able to google everything!
06:42  EdLin: I google everything on my phone.
06:42  LaraX: I google everything too... when it lets me
06:42  EdLin: in the middle of a conversation, someone asks a question, I google it. :)
06:42  LaraX: EdLin: I do that on IRC even if I'm not sure how something is spelled, but I'm bad at multitasking
06:42  remyo: LaraX: I just thought it was funny
06:43  EdLin: LaraX: so you're like an iPad, and I'm like an Android tablet. ;-)
06:43  LaraX: remyo: yeah I'm sure I can find it, but I was also asking him since he's around there
06:44  EdLin: though most Android tablets are awful, and none of them have the market, so, no apps.
06:44  LaraX: remyo: I guess a lot of people here want it? or maybe it's people in cities who know about these things more
06:45  remyo: Yes
06:45  LaraX: EdLin: no idea what I'm like, maybe a bananaphone
06:45  remyo: http://www.destination360.com/north-america/us/georgia/atlanta/images/s/farmers-markets.jpg
06:45  remyo: This is the place I usually go to
06:46  remyo: It's this HUGE international farmers market. 
06:46  LaraX: remyo: yeah you showed me that pic before, it's so big
06:46  EdLin: LaraX: you seem obsessed with fruit tonight, even your phone's a bananana, (though we usually obsess about Apples here)
06:46  LaraX: EdLin: I'm always obsessed with fruit/health food :) Apples too
06:46  remyo: Yep :)
06:46  EdLin: LaraX: I'm obsessed with Dr Pepper. ;-)
06:46  LaraX: we can talk about Apples instead
06:47  EdLin: especially the McIntosh
06:47  LaraX: EdLin: it's better to be obsessed with just... pepper
06:47  EdLin: LaraX: I like pepper too. :)
06:47  LaraX: good
06:48  LaraX: a Pepper a day keeps the Dr away
06:48  EdLin: lol
06:49  EdLin: LaraX: I'm actually drinking an Israeli Pepsi Max now, they didn't have Dr P at the kosher grocer my roommate went to and I was too lazy to shop again.
06:50  remyo: It's times like this that I miss Soda
06:50  EdLin: remyo: what happened?
06:51  remyo: I just stopped drinking it. 
06:51  EdLin: lol. OK. I've thought of doing that too.
06:51  remyo: It's hard at first. You'll feel a lot better though 
06:51  LaraX: EdLin: if you like soda, you should try this: http://www.rwknudsenfamily.com/products/spritzers
06:51  LaraX: remyo: you too
06:52  LaraX: or you can just mix carbonated water with fruit juice and it would taste simlar I think... sweet + bubbly ?
06:52  EdLin: LaraX: are they kosher? They don't mention if they are.
06:52  remyo: What I did when I was quitting was mix seltzer water with a lime and stevia 
06:53  LaraX: EdLin: I don't know, do you need every item to say that?
06:53  LaraX: remyo: green stevia?
06:53  EdLin: LaraX: pretty much. Fruit juices can be prepared with Grape Juice, and then you're worried about yayin nesach (wine of an idolatrer)
06:55  remyo: LaraX: Yeah, I think so. I don't remember.
06:55  remyo: I just remember it didn't make me feel as awful as sugar did. I hardly ever use it anymore though
06:55  EdLin: remyo: one of my roommates is into seltzer.
06:56  EdLin: remyo: he gets it by the case.
06:57  remyo: It's great if you're trying to quit soda
06:57  LaraX: I used to love fruit juice with seltzer
06:57  EdLin: remyo: he only drinks soda on the Sabbath and holidays.
06:57  EdLin: remyo: and even then, usually he likes fruit sodas.
06:58  EdLin: LaraX: grape juice is good with seltzer.
06:58  EdLin: LaraX: I usually put that into seltzer on Shabbos if someone is serving seltzer.
06:58  LaraX: EdLin: yeah that's what I used to have when I was little, but I don't crave soda now or anything
06:59  EdLin: LaraX: you're probably in good shape because you don't drink soda, and eat all natural, etc. :)
06:59  LaraX: remyo: do you think still or sparkling mineral water is better? I've heard the carbonation is good for digestion but bad for bones?
07:00  EdLin: LaraX: some other things are bad for bones, spinich is, but not too bad unless you eat a lot of it.
07:00  LaraX: EdLin: pretty good shape and my health isn't perfect but I try :)
07:00  remyo: I can drink A LOT of still water but I get tired of sparkling water pretty fast. So I would assume still.
07:00  LaraX: EdLin: yeah and other leafy greens too, from the oxalic acid
07:01  remyo: But thats just going off of "feeling". I don't know how one or the other effects the body
07:01  EdLin: LaraX: I had spinich in my lacto-vegetarian lasagna today. :)
07:02  LaraX: remyo: I don't like the taste of the sparking one, was just wondering if it was better somehow. even when I used to drink soda sometimes a long time ago I'd always want to wait for it to get flat first, like I'd shake it a little then leave it opened
07:02  LaraX: then by the next day it was ok
07:02  remyo: Like I said. I like still water better too. 
07:02  remyo: When I exercise I drink it A LOT
07:03  remyo: I can't imagine doing the case with sparkling water
07:03  LaraX: EdLin: spinach is good, I prefer it raw though, the cooked one takes forever to chew
07:03  EdLin: LaraX: I love raw spinich, though obviously the lasagna's was cooked.
07:04  EdLin: LaraX: my dad had a vegetable garden back in virginia, he grew spinach sometimes over the winter, it survives frost.
07:04  remyo: Spinach is a great source of protein too if you're a raw foodist 
07:05  LaraX: the only problem with spinach as usual is I keep finding bugs in it
07:05  LSD`: well, that serves you right for being one of those organic loving hippies :P
07:05  EdLin: LaraX: the one I ate was frozen, but it said it was bodek and was inspected for bugs. :)
07:05  LaraX: but they're in everything
07:05  LSD`: If you'd just let them use pesticides... :P
07:06  LaraX: LSD`: would you rather eat chemicals or bugs? I'd rather eat neither
07:06  LSD`: ...whichever one is cheaper XD
07:06  EdLin: it's possible to have organic produce that's clean of bugs, the local kosher health-food market sells stuff like that.
07:06  LaraX: EdLin: I'll believe it when I see it!
07:07 * LaraX goes to Brooklyn
07:07  EdLin: LaraX: well, they don't sell fresh produce there....
07:07  remyo: Spinach makes me think of popeye. And popeye makes me think of the song "He Needs Me". And I really love that song. 
07:07  EdLin: LaraX: fresh produce is only in the plain kosher mart
07:07  remyo: And although I eat it a lot I don't think I've developed a taste for it.
07:07  LSD`: If the hippies were genuinely serious about the supposed benefits of organic produce, then it wouldn't cost more than non-organic
07:08  LaraX: EdLin: well frozen is ok for some things like berries, but they don't really have bugs either, or at least places for them to hide, as much
07:08  EdLin: LSD`: it's not their fault that they don't eat as much of it as the chemical-popping non-hippies. :) That's why it's more expensive mostly.
07:09  EdLin: I've got some important email to attend to, bbs.
07:09  LaraX: I should use email too, now that I can!
07:09  EdLin: lol.
07:09  EdLin: brb
07:09 * LaraX feels like she just discovered the internet :p
07:09  LaraX: bye
07:11  CPng|N: ?
07:11  CPng|N: you get your new machine?
07:12  LaraX: CPng|N: no but my internet finally works again! it's Sprint 4G now. I spent like 5 hours trying to get gmail to load this morning with 3G. it's been ridiculous
07:13  CPng|N: ah
07:13  remyo: LaraX: So you'll be around more often? :)
07:13  CPng|N: I've been enjoying my 3g
07:13  LaraX: I had to keep reloading pages hoping one of those times was while there was internet for a few minutes
07:13  LaraX: remyo: yes, things should be back to normal now  I hope :) unless something else happens...

07:21 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 76 seconds
07:22  LaraX: remyo: it might be ok to sleep on something on the floor, like a futon?
07:22  LaraX: like a simpler bed
07:22  remyo: Not anymore. 
07:22  remyo: I did that for a long time and I think I'm over it
07:22  LaraX: is the box spring and all that really necessary?
07:22  LaraX: ok
07:23  LaraX: this is a nice song
07:23  remyo: LaraX: Unless I can get a bed sunken into the floor. Like the Beatles bed, remember? I pretty much want a standard bed. 
07:23  LaraX: oh yeah
07:23  remyo: I do too. I find myself singing it all the time
07:24  LaraX: I still couldn't find that sunken bed I was going to show you, which reminded me we've talked about this before
07:24  CPng|N: man i thought my music was creepy and weird
07:24  LaraX: what kind is it/
07:24  LaraX: ?*
07:25  LaraX: this doesn't sound creepy or weird, just old fashioned
07:25  CPng|N: that video
07:25  CPng|N: er, youtube you posted
07:25  LaraX: I meant what kind do you listen to
07:25  remyo: CPng|N: Thank you
07:26  CPng|N: skinny puppy and the like
07:26  CPng|N: remyo: not into a memory foam matress?
07:26  LaraX: creepy is some ambient music I've heard that almost sounds like horror movie music
07:26  CPng|N: yep
07:26  CPng|N: that's it
07:26  LaraX: I can't tell if it's relaxing or scary
07:26  remyo: CPng|N: If I can find one in a full that isn't crazy expensive I'll be into getting it
07:27  CPng|N: dronezone is a good example. and some other similar shoutcast streams
07:27  CPng|N: oh that's easy
07:27  LaraX: CPng|N: yeah, and DI's ambient stream
07:27  LaraX: that's another thing I haven't been able to do all this time, listen to streaming radio
07:27 * LaraX does that
07:28  CPng|N: i was listening to one on my droid. that was awesome. I've been wanting to do that for 10 years
07:28  remyo: Pandora has made me get into Chamber music again
07:31  spline: DI rocks
07:31  spline: they are run from nyc
07:32  spline: their techno is usually a nice 4-4 tresor-style
07:32  LaraX: remyo: I think memory foam feels better in your hand when you squeeze it and the idea of it than when you actually sleep on it, I've slept on someone's Tempur-Pedic and it wasn't a big deal
07:32  LaraX: spline: they are?
07:33  LaraX: remyo: not saying it's bad either though it might make you hot
07:33  spline: yeah I met one of the guys once at a meetup thing and shared some scotch
07:33  spline: cool group it seemed
07:33  remyo: LaraX: No, too late. You've already helped me decide they're just not for me
07:33  LaraX: remyo: and I had an imitation Tempur-Pedic once and it didn't even come close
07:33  spline: but they do good tecno/streams.. best Ive seen next to SoMa
07:34  spline: and soma is >10years now
07:34  spline: first place I found broadcasting downtempo which I love
07:34  LaraX: spline: my internet is working and I have 4G now btw!
07:34  spline: is it much faster?
07:34  spline: friend of mine uses it I found and he barely gets interruptions
07:35  LaraX: spline: it took like 5 hours to get gmail to load this morning with 3G, Sprint SmartView is lying, it's showing full bars but then on the button where it asked if I wanted to switch to 4G it showed that 3G had one bar which was more accurate, and it was switching to 1XRTT even today
07:35  spline: LaraX: loved the gov debates there last night
07:36  spline: ouch
07:36  spline: anyone around you have it that bad?
07:36  LaraX: spline: yeah and it seems to be faster than 3G ever was, though I haven't gotten to test it much, just got it working a few hours ago :)
07:36  spline: might one day come to find out your neighbors running some old school speaker causing tons of interference
07:36  LaraX: I don't know but Sprint said they got other complaints from around here

08:45  Tomis: surprisingly googling "who owns verizon" actually answered the question
08:50  LaraX: remyo: then who owns remyo?
08:50  remyo: Verizon 
08:50  LaraX: exactly :p

08:57  LaraX: oops
08:57  remyo: Wow. I'm awesome
08:57  spline: ron
08:58  remyo: Well on LaraX's link it clearly says "Jeremy", minus the ron. And as my first name is Jeremy I have to assume it's all about me
08:58  spline: spline is found by an iterative algorithm using weighted least squares cubic splines
08:58  spline: booyeah
08:59  spline: larax is sent to new towns
08:59  spline: larax is captured by the teutons
08:59  spline: larax is a rather limited and unsympathetic character
08:59  LaraX: my nick is there?
08:59  spline: http://www.googlism.com/who_is/l/larax/
09:00  LaraX: my favorite one from http://www.googlism.com/who_is/l/lara/ is probably "lara is a limited edition cold"
09:00  LaraX: you better catch me while you can
09:00  spline: OoO limited edition
09:01 * spline likes rare stuff
09:01  LaraX: lol
09:01 * LaraX gives spline a limited edition cold
09:01  Angostura: lara is a national organization whose missions include the representation of luftwaffe aircrew at historical displays
09:02  spline: haha usually getting colds from women is not a bad thing

09:03  Angostura: angostura is full of treasures and secrets
09:03  spline: LaraX: well nobody does but im indicating the biological delivery method where its usually transacted
09:04  LaraX: spline: I didn't know colds were caught any specific way other than being too close to someone who was sick, though I'm sure you can do all that without getting sick too :)
09:05  spline: oh yeah I recall the days of getting sick prior to finals just by going to class
09:05  remyo: What did I miss? 
09:06  LaraX: me
09:06  spline: haha
09:06  remyo: :(
09:06  spline: stealing the limelight
09:06  LaraX: ok then, spline
09:06  remyo: As USUAL
09:06  spline: remyo: you need a super cool mrcoffee.org znc
09:06  LaraX: fine, you missed Tomis!
09:06  spline: so you dont miss all of larax's action
09:06  LaraX: lol
09:06  remyo: I do have a server I could ssh into

09:07  spline: tanner: just jailbroke the new appletv?
09:07  remyo: LaraX: noticed the what?
09:08  tanner: someone got an app to install

09:08  LaraX: yeah
09:08  EdLin: Textual > *
09:08  remyoX: No. I've had a spare linux machine to play with and I thought your nick was cool so I added X to the end of this version
09:08  LaraX: EdLin: yeah but not on a PC...
09:09  spline: lara and her X clan
09:09  EdLin: on a PC, I use HydraIRC
09:09  LaraX: remyo: thanks, you know what I said about your nick too
09:10  remyo: What did you say about my nick? 
09:10  LaraX: EdLin: my XChat trial ran out so I'm on SilvereX now (XChat 2)
09:10  LaraX: remyo: about the o and adding it to mine...

09:10  spline: nice
09:10  LaraX: EdLin: you told me about it but it doesn't have colored nicks remember
09:11  spline: looks like a good client
09:11  EdLin: oh
09:11  spline: LaraX: problably has a script though
09:11  LaraX: maybe
09:11  EdLin: spline: it is, it can display all of your channels at once in one window, while displaying each individual channel in a multidocument window.
09:11  EdLin: spline: takes good advantages of Windows's interface strengths I guess.
09:12  spline: yeah it didnt look Qt
09:12  spline: Im looking at the source now
09:12  spline: or looking for
09:13  tanner: Qt is disgusting
09:13  spline: LaraX: if the screenshots I linked to before of the air are true, it looks like a really nice laptop
09:13  tanner: but, it's better than GTK
09:13  spline: solid state 11 inch mac
09:13  remyo: I think I've gotten to used to irssi. Whenever I try something else it feels too weird 
09:13  spline: same
09:13  spline: I hate learning all my /win shortcuts then using something else.. even though I like textual
09:13  LaraX: spline: but the pic only showed it on the inside right? I want to see the outside
09:13  remyo: Yeah
09:14  spline: I still want to improve upon the plugin I have to add lots of / switches
09:14  LaraX: this thing keeps wanting to type spaceninja instead of spline
09:14  spline: I think mikey didnt come from the console IRC days so he doesnt appreciate the commands like we do
09:14  remyo: Someone showed me weechat recently though and their setup seemed cool
09:14  spline: I spent 15 years inside ircii or epic or irssi
09:14  spline: LaraX: it looks like a smaller air.. and 11 is the perfect size
09:15  spline: im on my mini9 and its annoying enough with the keyboard
09:15  LaraX: spline: yeah smaller would be better
09:15  remyo: Dell mini 9?
09:16  spline: yeah
09:16  spline: textual still looks fine but more the keyboard
09:16  iaj: Hi there
09:16  spline: fine for chatting and loading up my reading 
09:16  LaraX: hi
09:16  spline: remyoX: dreamhost doesnt allow background pids I thought
09:17  iaj: Can someone tell me whether how I could get Java Server VM instead of Java Client VM running?
09:17  remyo: spline: It sure does
09:17  remyoX: testing
09:18  spline: ah they do now?
09:18  spline: didnt when I had them years ago
09:18  spline: iaj: might want to google that.. never looked into it
09:18  LaraX: spline: I'm mostly hoping the MacBook Air will be black, like the AppleTV... hoping they redesign this already. I hate how it currently looks
09:18  remyo: LaraX: You'll find out in a few hours
09:19  spline: LaraX: you also have to get used to the weight where it might not hold in a lap or move around with movement you are not used to 
09:19  LaraX: remyo: I'm waiting but he's bringing it up :)
09:19  LaraX: spline: what do you mean? it'll be too light?
09:20  remyo: "Ladies and gentleman, the new Macbook Air is so light it literally floats out of your hands" 
09:20  spline: well you are used to about 5lbs 
09:20  spline: so it wills it in your lap
09:20  LaraX: it's so light it's non-existant!
09:20  spline: drop that to about 3 and even a light finger/not heavy typer could knock it out
09:20  spline: heh
09:20  spline: nice on her majestys secret service is on usa
09:20  spline: even though lazenby is the fake bond
09:21  remyo: What Apples going to do is tie a million Macbook Airs to the top of the building and float away like Up
09:21  spline: but diana rigg is an awesome bond girl
09:21  remyo: And thats pretty much going to be the whole event
09:21  LaraX: spline: not really, I didn't take that anywhere or even put it on my lap unless I was cold and wanted to warm up (like now)
09:21  spline: remyo: true "cloud computing"
09:21  remyo: HA!!!
09:21  spline: its so light.. its in the cloud
09:21  spline: heh
09:21  remyo: Good one, sir
09:22  spline: LaraX: true
09:22  LaraX: MacBook Air filled with helium?
09:22  LSD`: "New MacBook Air: smaller, lighter and even less powerful than the old one, only now twice as expensive!"
09:22  remyo: LaraX: No... With magic.
09:22  spline: prestochango
09:23  remyo: spline: Anyway. Looks like Dreamhost handles irssi fine. I actually think it's installed by default because I don't remember doing it on that server
09:23  spline: yeah but they dont allow background pids unless you have a server
09:23  remyo: Hrm. Unless it just comes with Debian
09:23  remyo: As thats what Dreamhost uses
09:24  spline: yes
09:24  spline: always have
09:24  spline: they have always run a good unix shop
09:24  remyo: Well thats it then
09:33  remyoX: Yey!
09:40  spline: fear
09:45  remyoX: fear, spline?
09:45  spline: heh
09:45  spline: well I always love the hostnames
09:45  spline: old school "neat" 
09:45  remyoX: By the way. This is nice and quick. Almost no latency
09:45  spline: what's your ms to the box?
09:46  remyoX: My ms?
09:47  LSD`: milliseconds, as in ping
09:49  remyoX: Ah, yeah

10:43  Angostura: I thought Lazenby did a good job spline - even if they had to over dub him :-)
10:44  spline: heh
10:45  spline: beyond craig, im still a fan of moore
10:45  spline: beyond some parts of GE, brosnan-era was blah
10:46  Angostura: Moore, I thought was undoubtedly the worst
10:46  Angostura: but my mum liked him :-)
10:47  spline: well you can't one-up connery 
10:47  spline: I still love the theme music to Ohmss the best, though
10:47  spline: forget the name of the orchestra that performed it
10:47  spline: Angostura: did you like what they did bringing Craig back?
10:47  spline: or bringing back Bond with Craig
10:47  LSD`: spline: john barry orcehstra?
10:48  spline: bingo
10:48  spline: damn nice to see some bond fans here :-D
10:48  spline: I was hoping that our "Batman" would evolve into a similar tale, even though its different
10:49  LSD`: Apparently there were lyrics written to go with that, they were just never used (unlike From Russia with Love) and quite possibly never recorder
10:49  spline: interesting
10:49  spline: I have the DVD collectors set from 02 or so with lots of special features, but never visited that dvd
10:49  Angostura: spline: I thought Casiino Royale was excellent, I thought the second one was pants
10:50  spline: it's nice as they were able to go back, rescue much of the archive material and also interview much of the cast/actors since most are still alive
10:50  LSD`: you mean, casino royale, part 2? :P
10:50  spline: Eva Green is also.. mmmph
10:51  Angostura: LSD`: Yup. Just badly directed IMHO
10:52  spline: good to see the DB4 vantage in it
11:29  cameronmalek: so will there be discussion here today regarding the apple event?
11:30  cameronmalek: I'm somewhat new to IRC and don't know the good rooms for these sorts of things
11:30  spline: the apple channels on irc generally discuss the apple news out there
11:36  iaj: hey, hm, is there some app that lets you map the keysequentence of 'jj' to escape in a certain program?
13:00  kennyG: Did it start already?
13:15  iaj: okay, here I go - we got an Exchange System here and we need to find a solution for using it remotely - so that one has access to all of the stuff on his exchange account.
13:15  iaj: Anyone know of a handy solution?
13:37  ralnaemi: Anyone here use iWork?
13:49  londonmet050: Any one knew USB wireless adapter that works with panther
13:52  lhunath: is there a method similar to opt-shift-k (which produces ) but to produce an option-key or command-key symbol?
13:57  MaximusColourum: I just checked the character palate, and it does not look like they exist. Try command+option+T
13:59  MaximusColourum: well, the apple  is not in the palate either
14:02  lhunath: they certainly do exist in UTF-8
14:03  lhunath: this is the closest I've come on google: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=122010
14:06  MaximusColourum: huh
14:06  MaximusColourum: I don't know how to use those 4 char strings
14:09  lhunath: ⌘
14:10  lhunath: hmm.  unicode text input and remembering codes.  kind of a PITA.

14:19  eightfold: robgleeson: thanks alot
14:19  robgleeson: no prob!
14:19  Marvolo: Is refurb a legitimate way to go?
14:21  iaj: wasnt there an app that let you reconfigure keymappings for specific apps?
14:41  bassliner: Marvolo: refurbished macs are okay, tho they're overpriced if you keep in mind the prices you pay for normal ones.
14:42  b3ny0-: all macs are overpriced
14:43  bassliner: that's entirely true.
14:44  bassliner: thinkpads are overpriced too, but they're worth it.
14:44  b3ny0-: never understood the greatness of those
14:45  b3ny0-: they still look like they did in 1994
14:45  b3ny0-: :P
14:45  bassliner: and if you want to take computers a bit more serious, you'll end up buying something that satisfies, which in turn exculpates the price for macbook pros or thinkpads.
14:45  b3ny0-: only thinner
14:45  bassliner: b3ny0-: i don't care what they look like. i have 3 of them and they never ever abandoned me.
14:46  _KaszpiR_: how the hell download apps from itunes to the ipad
14:46  b3ny0-: not that I'm a mac fanboy or anything, but I wouldn't want windows on any laptop
14:46  _KaszpiR_: in buy history i got keynote bounght but there is no goddamn download button
14:47  b3ny0-: its perfectly fine on a desktop though
14:49 --- Tomis2 is now known as Tomis
14:51  PointMan: any idea how I can get mail.app to download all of my mails stored on IMAP?
15:03  Marvolo: $1270 < $1500. I think I may go with a refurb. My question is the quality/dependability of a refurb product. Is it worth the savings?

16:18  robgleeson: hrmmm
16:18  robgleeson: does anyone know when the AppleTV will be able to receive movie content from other macs?
16:19  londonmet050: Thinkpads are overpriced?
16:19  zer0her0: robgleeson: doesn't it do it now w/ media sharing options?
16:19  zer0her0: londonmet050: um wrong channel?
16:19  robgleeson: zer0her0: I don't think so, no.
16:20  londonmet050: bassliner: thinkpads are overpriced too, but they're worth it.
16:20  robgleeson: zer0her0: Audio & Pictures are supported so far.
16:20  zer0her0: robgleeson: interesting, that sucks, i need to pick one up tomorrow
16:20  zer0her0: and play around w/ it
16:20  robgleeson: zer0her0: haha, i'm getting mine tomorrow too :D
16:20  zer0her0: robgleeson: nice :)
16:21  robgleeson: "And stream photos and music from your computer to your widescreen TV" taken from Apple.com
16:21  robgleeson: it omits video content, so yeah..
16:21  bassliner: londonmet050: absolutely.
16:21  Angostura: robgleeson: I'm sure it does that now - there is a 'Computers' item in the sources
16:21  londonmet050: bassliner:  I thought MAC's are actually good value for money
16:21  zer0her0: brb
16:21  robgleeson: Angostura: I've heard we're waiting for a firmware update, most likely in November. 
16:22  robgleeson: I hope they annouce it at todays event.
16:22  bassliner: londonmet050: thinkpads are rugged raw and rock solid. i know i could kill a customer and continue working on a project without any side impacts to the machine whatsoever, maybe i would have to clean it from blood, but it would just work.
16:22  londonmet050: lol
16:22  robgleeson: Angostura: sure, for pictures & audio.
16:22  londonmet050: Sure
16:23  londonmet050: But I am not sure about the new generation thinkpads
16:23  londonmet050: They removed roll cage from displays
16:23  londonmet050: in W and T
16:23  londonmet050: models
16:23  bassliner: londonmet050: when i want pure reliability, i would go for nothing but my little slow and old but rock-solid and stable thinkpad with those nerdy geek-stickers on it.
16:23  londonmet050: ok
16:23  bassliner: londonmet050: tho i would go for the macbook for dj'ing in the clubs.
16:23  londonmet050: nice
16:24  zer0her0: bassliner: nice
16:26  zer0her0: thinkpad is second to powerbooks in my laptop of choice
16:26  londonmet050: poerbooks?
16:26  zer0her0: i used to travel w/ both for a long time, thinking about getting another thinkpad, but now that's it lenova i've heard mixed things
16:26  zer0her0: londonmet050: powerbooks were the old macbook pro brand name
16:29  robgleeson: Angostura: uhh, I think I'm wrong.
16:29  robgleeson: read this on the website now: You can already stream music, photos, and video from your computer to Apple TV
16:29  Angostura: No, I think I'm  wrong
16:29  robgleeson: I think the firmware update is for AirPlay.
16:30  robgleeson: http://www.apple.com/appletv/#remote
16:33  bassliner: apropos hardware, i have NO goddamn clue why these dell notebooks are more and more coming up. i see them more and more, they look cheap, they FEEL cheap, and they are even more expensive than thinkpads. 
16:34  bassliner: for half the money it would probably be good notebooks for starters, but for that amount of money it's a joke.
16:35  zer0her0: bassliner: which dell notebooks?
16:36  bassliner: zer0her0: i would have to spy when passing by the customer that sits next to my boss who sits straight ahead.
16:36  bassliner: wait a minute. i'll do it...
16:37  zer0her0: haha, oh.
16:41  masu3701: how do i get more languages on OS X leopard?
16:41  bassliner: zer0her0: http://www.laptoppicker.com/archives/dell-latitude-e4200-e4300-laptop.jpg
16:41  bassliner: zer0her0: those
16:41  bassliner: dell latitude something
16:41  masu3701: i used the install cd to install optional installs and languages but it doesnt work
16:43  zer0her0: masu3701: more language in the menus?
16:44  zer0her0: bassliner: that's not to bad looking
16:44  zer0her0: bassliner: what thinkpad do you use?
16:44  bassliner: zer0her0: t43 & t61 home, x300 at work.
16:45  bassliner: tho the t43 is WAY slower than the t61 i love it way more for some reason (higher resolution display, smaller in size)
16:45  zer0her0: hehe
16:45  bassliner: and the t43 was CHEAP!
16:45  zer0her0: what do you run on them?
16:45  bassliner: i LOVE that machine!
16:45  zer0her0: haha
16:46  bassliner: zer0her0: fedora 13 on the t43, ubuntu 10.10 on the t61, debian unstable on the t300 (my co workers hate me for that)
16:46  zer0her0: haha
16:46  zer0her0: nice
16:46  Branes: So, nothing remotely useful then :)
16:46  zer0her0: yea i'm looking at prob running ubuntu.
16:46  bassliner: zer0her0: let me tell you ubuntu 10.10 is very good but dont use the gnome desktop that comes with it and replace it with something useful.
16:46  zer0her0: Branes: oh hush you :P
16:47  zer0her0: yea i run 10.10 on my netbook, need to wipe it out as it's actually running from beta of 10.10
16:47  bassliner: zer0her0: my workstation here at work runs ubuntu 10.04 and believe me it sometimes is pain in the butt.
16:47  masu3701: zer0her0: in system preference under languages and text
16:48  bassliner: zer0her0: the first thing i do on a freshly installed ubuntu is removing some of the useless overhead bloat that comes with it.
16:48  kennyG: Did it happen yet?
16:48  zer0her0: masu3701: click edit list, that should list all available languages
16:48  zer0her0: kennyG: you ask the most vague questions
16:48  Branes: kennyG: No, three hours and some.
16:48  kennyG: zer0her0, see Branes got me.
16:49  kennyG: Branes, Haaaaa...
16:49  zer0her0: bassliner: hehe yea i wasn't a fan of 10.04 unfortunately.
16:49  zer0her0: kennyG: i am sorry i don't reward people that ask vague questions.
16:49  masu3701: but i think i figure it out...had to move my preferencePanel from room to /system/library under the other account
16:49  kennyG: I did a upgrade on my Ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10 and now I cannot log on it anymore :(
16:50  zer0her0: kennyG: so it really was a useful upgrade ;)
16:50  kennyG: zer0her0, yeah! lol
16:50  Branes: But, I can give you a few details anyway. iLife 11, Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the MacBook Air gets replaced by a 10.7" iPad/Air hyprid running iOS, and there'll be the return of "one more thing".
16:51  kennyG: There will be any OS upgrades today or just a preview of futire?
16:51  kennyG: s/fiture/future
16:51  kennyG: s/s/fiture/future/s/futire/future
16:51  kennyG: like a three
16:51  Branes: Probably nothing will be available. Just news on what's coming, with the new iOS device to appear in channel within two weeks.
16:51  Angostura: previews of a future future
16:51  kennyG: s/three/tree
16:52  Angostura: What new iOS device would that be?
16:52  kennyG: well, at least it's something.
16:53  Branes: Apart from the machine replacing the Air, I have no idea.
17:01  vikas: hi
17:01  vikas: any one there
17:02  robgleeson: woo!
17:02  robgleeson: apple are live streaming the event :D
17:02  zer0her0: robgleeson: link?
17:03  robgleeson: http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/10/20/apple-to-provide-live-video-stream-of-back-to-the-mac-event/
17:03  Branes: http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/10/20/apple-back-mac-event-gets-live-stream/ -- Never a company to miss out on a dramatic entrance, Apple left it until the last minute to announce that the even will be streamed live at 10am California time, but only if you have a Mac running OSX 10.6 or another Apple device running iOS4.
17:05  Tu13es: do you just go to the apple site on your ios device?
17:06  robgleeson: yeah, but it won't be available for another 2-3 hours.
17:08  alexbobP: ooh, I have os x 10.6
17:08  alexbobP: I feel like I'm part of some exclusive club
17:08  zer0her0: you are
17:09  alexbobP: now I can listen to some clown with an ego the size of jupiter talk about what passes for innovation over at Apple
17:09  zer0her0: it's like a country club, where no colored folk are allowed.
17:09  alexbobP: an entire few hours before the rest of the world gets to hear it!
17:09  Branes: I can't be arsed hanging around, I'm heading to bed, I'll see what His Arrogance has decided to call the Air/iPad hybrid when I get up.
17:10  zer0her0: Branes: night, good seeing you
17:10  alexbobP: my money's on iSlate
17:11  alexbobP: imagine if apple packaged a stylus with one of their touchscreen devices, that'd be epic
17:11  zer0her0: alexbobP: um what
17:11  zer0her0: apple.com/ipad
17:11  zer0her0: ;)
17:11  zer0her0: welcome to last year
17:12  Branes: Nah, it'll have a keyboard. The hybrid will replace the Air, sport a traditional clamshell formfactor with a 10.7" retina display and keyboard, and run iOS.
17:12  alexbobP: ipad has stylus??
17:12  alexbobP: zer0her0: where's the stylus?
17:12  londonmet050: where is the link for live event
17:12  zer0her0: alexbobP: look at your hands
17:12  alexbobP: zer0her0: so really what you're saying is, it *doesn't* have a stylus
17:13  zer0her0: gah, rent-a-center you are worse then a loanshark collector's thugs
17:13  Branes: If you really want to draw on an iPad with a pen-shaped peripheral, there's two on the market that I know of, they use a semiconductive plastic.
17:13  alexbobP: zer0her0: but you saw the opportunity to waste my time and try to confuse me, so you took that opportunity
17:13  zer0her0: alexbobP: you make dumb comments, that waste everyones time, figured i'd return the favor

21:28  LaraX: danl: singce you're the googling expert, can you find this for me? every time I google I can't find it and need your skills... I'm looking for a good pic of Sanrio's old logo, it's a heart with curls under it. I might get a tattoo of it
21:28  LaraX: I have it on some old Sanrio items I have but can't find it online
21:29  danl: sure
21:29  danl: give me 4-5 minutes
21:29  LaraX: thanks, and I'm looking again too
21:29  CPng|N: is it primarily 1 color? that could help
21:29  CPng|N: filter by color
21:30  LaraX: this logo is from when they started in the mid 70s I guess? to around the mid 90s when they changed their logo
21:30  LaraX: CPng|N: yeah it's just black
21:31  antii: omg
21:31  antii: Macbook Air 13" looks awsom
21:32  LaraX: I'd also like to find their old Puroland logo which changed around 1999? I was in Japan for New Year's Eve 2000 and found an item at Puroland with the old logo. but finding Sanrio's is more important
21:32  LaraX: antii: it's better than the current one, I might get the 11"
21:33  antii: I want the 13" :o
21:33  danl: LaraX: do you have any examples of it, if even poor?
21:34  b3ny0-: I'd rather have an ipad
21:34  LaraX: danl: I do, but only on really old Sanrio items I have from before the mid-90s, nothing on paper or scanned, maybe I should take a pic of it
21:35  danl: Please :D
21:35  CPng|N: you should
21:35  CPng|N: there was a vintagesanrio.com site that someone said had the old logo, but looks like that site is gone

22:17  danl: You got me wanting to look for my copy again
22:18  FriedBob: danl: Soultrap (or any attack spell, I use fire damage cause I can start with it) on target for 0/0/1 (defaults) plus <spell> on self will make the self spell permanennt
22:18  FriedBob: If you buy "jack of all trades" in Seyda Neen, you can get the Fortify Attribute spell available for spell making.
22:19  FriedBob: So, fire damage on target default values ( 0-0 1 sec 0 radius) + fortify luck 100-100 on self 1 sec.
22:20  FriedBob: Cast till you can always cast it from luck alone, then get your luck wherever you want it ( I like 39xx).
22:20  FriedBob: Then repeat, but use Int, Will, Agility, Endurance & Personality on self + firedamage
22:21  FriedBob: I don't recommend increasing Strength or Speed very much, if at all.
22:21  danl: FriedBob: those are the fun ones
22:21  FriedBob: Mu Nightblade is L74, but has a magicka of 11988
22:22  danl: I had a character that could jump clean over a town
22:22  FriedBob: danl: Speed much over 300 can easily crash the game.
22:22  FriedBob: And I had a massive Strength and 1-hit killed Dagoth Ur at the end of the game.
22:22  danl: been there too
22:22  FriedBob: Killed him so dead the 2nd instance didn't spawn
22:22  danl: Nice
22:23  FriedBob: Yeah, except for not being able to complete the MW
22:23  FriedBob: MQ rather
22:23  danl: thats what save points are for
22:23  FriedBob: Or the console
22:24  FriedBob: But the STR was perm, and it broke the game cause I had it too high
22:24  danl: yup
22:24  danl: haha
22:24  FriedBob: Currently my STR is 120. 100 natural + 20 in CE enchantments
22:25  FriedBob: I made a spell called "Epic Flashbang"
22:26  FriedBob: Blind 100%, Burden 100pts, Sound 125, paralyze & light for 10 seconds on target.
22:26  FriedBob: (I have a mod that lets me do spells up to 500)
22:26  danl: heh
22:27  FriedBob: "Epic Troll" - Frenzy Humanoid 50-100pts for 4s on target
22:28  FriedBob: The flashbang costs 1150 to cast though.
22:29  FriedBob: I also have "Epic Flamewar" - Weakness to fire 100% for 2s (on touch) + fire damage 500 pts for 2s on target

23:41  Dice-Man: great place
23:42 * vxla should have stayed on vacation.
23:42  vxla: sigh
23:42  Dice-Man: hey i'm not a lawyer
23:42  Dice-Man: i can't buy a mac
23:42  Dice-Man: but i love the ipod
23:43  CPng|N: Dice-Man:  the drugs. put them away.
23:43  Dice-Man: wut
23:43  Dice-Man: i'm not an addict
23:43  LaraX: CPng|N: thanks, though this isn't th right one, this is a new 50th anniversary logo, the other one was used from around the 70s-90s
23:43  Dice-Man: my only drug is mac
23:43  LaraX: the*
23:43  CPng|N: oh. closest thing I've seen with things at the bottom of the heart
23:43  Dice-Man: i cannot stay one day without seeing a mac
23:44  LaraX: yeah it's similar
23:44  CPng|N: I figured the new logo must be the word Sanrio with the o being th eheart
23:44  Dice-Man: hey last time my gf said : it's mac or me
23:44  Nachlader: Dice-Man is trolling
23:44  Dice-Man: i said mac
23:44  LaraX: scanning this should work, you can scan any flat object and get a clear picture right? though the reflection from the aluminum might still be a problem
23:45  LaraX: CPng|N: no, the old logo had two lines for the heart outline, then on the bottom of the heart they curved up and out
23:46 * danl ships lara his incredible
23:46  LaraX: danl: does it take better pics?
23:46  danl: great pucs
23:46  danl: *pics
23:47  LaraX: danl: what carrier?
23:48  Alexookah: ilife 11 download? or not yet leaked?
23:48  danl: the only good one
23:48  danl: verizon
23:48  FriedBob: danl: that's debatable. I think they all suck, just some suck less in some parts of the country.
23:48  LaraX: danl: since there was no iPhone/another announcement today I'm probably going to get a Sprint HTC EVO 4G or switch to AT&T for an iPhone 4 :(
23:49  LaraX: another carrier*
23:49  mroe: how do I take a screenshot using a drag-and-drop box in OS X?
23:49  vxla: Why did you think there'd be a carrier change on the iphone 4? That won't happen until at least January, right?
23:49  FriedBob: LaraX: I'm trying to get away from AT&T. Thinking of going to Sprint and getting an Epic, or whatever Android phone is current by the time I can switch
23:49  LaraX: mroe: you can use Grab or there are screenshot shortcuts
23:50  mroe: do you know the shortcuts?
23:50  LaraX: FriedBob: yeah, I haven't wanted AT&T all this time, but really need a new phone and want an iPhone, I've been waiting...
23:51  LaraX: mroe: not all of them but google does: http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X
23:51  danl: evo has similar hardware to my incredible
23:51  CPng|N: your System Preferences knows
23:52  FriedBob: LaraX: My wife wants an iphone. But not enough to stay w/ AT&T
23:52  LaraX: vxla: just because of the rumors and wishful thinking
23:52  LaraX: first they said Verizon iPhone in the summer, then today, but still not...
23:53  CPng|N: they've been saying maaaybe December but more likely first quart of 2011
23:53  CPng|N: in several sources. none of which I believe any more, since we went through this crap a year ago. and 2 years ago.
23:54  LaraX: ok well my phone keeps turning off and battery draining even while it's plugged in and supposedly charged, the camera is bad as you can see, browser is bad, etc... so I need to get something
23:55  CPng|N: yeah that's a horrible phone compared to todays smartphones
23:55  LaraX: yeah
23:55  CPng|N: note that smart phones don't last more than a day though anwyay
23:55  CPng|N: unless you're not really using it
23:56  danl: LaraX: this was taken from my phone: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/31841/IMAG0011.jpg
23:56  LaraX: at least it will stay turned on *while* it's plugged in and I won't miss messages and not even know I have them until I go to call someone...
23:56  LaraX: danl: wow, that's nice
23:57  LaraX: do the iPhone and EVO take pics that good?
23:57  danl: evo has same camera if I am not mistaken
23:57  danl: iPhone should take equally if not better pictures
23:58  LaraX: hopefully
23:58  b3ny0-: the 3GS camera is decent as long as lighting is good
23:59  danl: apparently the iphone 4g is only 5mp
23:59  danl: Evo and Incredible is 8mp
23:59  danl: granted, more than just mp matters
23:59  b3ny0-: "only"
23:59  CPng|N: yeah even though some of the droids have 8mp cameras, the iphone 4 camera is pretty damn nice
23:59  b3ny0-: you really need more on that tiny lens
23:59  danl: yup
23:59  mroe: it has a lot to do with sensor size
23:59  CPng|N: I've compared
23:59  CPng|N: the droid cams are a bit fuzzier
23:59  CPng|N: so it's a waste of pixels
23:59  b3ny0-: Sony Ericsson got 12mpix on some of their phones
23:59  b3ny0-: but what matters more is the lens
