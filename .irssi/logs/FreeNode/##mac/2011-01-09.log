18:26  TheNavyBear: I wish Apple would give out free iDisk (even at a smaller capacity)
18:27  MrUnagi: TheNavyBear: i made my own idisk
18:27  TheNavyBear: how
18:27  MrUnagi: set up a server
18:29  MrUnagi: pretty cool huh
18:30 --- danielgrieve is now known as danielgrieve_
18:45 +ChrisAM: How much is iDisk?
18:46  simplicity-: 20GB i believe?
18:46 +ChrisAM: I meant price... $99/year
18:47  danielgrieve_: shares space with your mail account though I think, and you can choose how much you allocate to each
18:48 --- danielgrieve_ is now known as danielgrieve
18:55  LadySerena: $99/year for only 20GB storage?  what a rip-off
18:55  simplicity-: Including everything else that MobileMe has, that is.
18:55  LadySerena: heh
18:56  LadySerena: if I really wanted, I can set up all the services MobileMe has on my own servers
18:57  LadySerena: and I'd have an entire hard drive worth of space - 300GB worth
18:57  simplicity-: I would like to know, what kinda software you would use for the contact sync.
18:57  LadySerena: that's the one I'd probably roll my own for
18:57  simplicity-: i can't seem to find anything that will sync _everything_, birthdays, contact pic, etc.
18:59 +ChrisAM: For just storage, RackSpace CloudFiles is pretty competitive on pricing.
18:59  LadySerena: of course, if I did set up my own servers as a complete MobileMe solution .... the only problem I'd have is "how do I configure MobileMe on my Mac to connect to my server instead of Apple?"
19:01 * LadySerena still wants the ability to mount SSH under /Volumes/
19:03  LadySerena: my Mac is the only machine I own that lacks the ability to mount an SSH server as a volume  :(
19:04 +ChrisAM: macfuse/sshfs won't work?
19:04  LadySerena: I haven't been able to get that solution to work since upgrading to Snow Leopard.
19:05 +crilly: None of the commercial solutions work?
19:05  LadySerena: commercial solutions?
19:05 +crilly: Also, you could get your MobileMe to sync to your server by editing your hosts file to resolve the normal Apple server hostname to your own server's IP.
19:06  LadySerena: yea, then I'd need to know the MobileMe hostnames ..... but that isn't all that difficult to get  >:D
19:07 +ChrisAM: LadySerena ... I just downloaded and installed MacFuse and MacFusion... mounted SSH right up
19:08 * simplicity- lulz

19:09 * LadySerena drips at the fang
19:22  TheNavyBear: is it bad that I compile my own software on OSX
19:22  S_SubZero: do what works for you
19:23  TheNavyBear: I compiled WGET, Alpine, Lynx, and ircII
19:23  g4bittin: i always use fink =)
19:24  TheNavyBear: I do not want something that is gonna make its own libraries instead of using OSXs
19:27 * LadySerena wonders why her servers don't show up in the Finder sidebar
19:31  LadySerena: ah, easy fix, that

20:07  CEnTR4L: ChrisAM, you could always get better deals at Amazon, I just got it for about 40ish USD last month.
20:08 +ChrisAM: Got what?
20:09  CEnTR4L: MobileMe individual subscription.
20:09 +ChrisAM: ah
20:10  CEnTR4L: MacFuse/MacFusion doesn't work on a 64-bit OS X right?
20:11 +Berzerker: it does
20:12  CEnTR4L: That thing never worked with me as it should.
20:17  MrUnagi: sigh, i think i need to stay off facebook
20:18  S_SubZero: ripe for a sarcastic remark but text chat doesn't allow sarcasm to work properly ; ;
20:19  MrUnagi: i just found a friend of mine from middle school that had a 6 year old sister and like a 9 year old brother.......havent seen them in like 13 years........
20:19  MrUnagi: i stumble on his sisters page and BAM shes now 19....and hot.....and it freaks me out
20:22 +crilly: Yeah OK MrUnagi, take tat to the social channel.
20:22  TheNavyBear: http://i.imgur.com/VfOMf.jpg
20:22 +crilly: And that, too.
20:23  MrUnagi_: i am going to straight throw this router out the window
20:23  TheNavyBear: what, it was a clean pic
20:24 --- MrUnagi_ is now known as MrUnagi
20:24 +crilly: TheNavyBear: very true, but it's the nature of the picture really. There is a social channel for junk :)
20:24  TheNavyBear: we have a social chan?
20:24 +crilly: Topic.
20:25 * TheNavyBear makes a not not to post anymore pics in this channe;

20:26  TheNavyBear: *note not

20:37  g4bittin: somone has Xcode 1.5 laying around on some old CD or something?
20:37 +crilly: Wow! What do you need such an old version for? I think Apple offer downloads to older versions of such things, don't they?

20:50  TheNavyBear: I put the serial number for my iBook G4 into the SupportProfile page, and while it added it just fine, I am willing to bet there is some guy at Apple looking over my support updates laughing his ass off right now
20:56 +crilly: Why?
20:56 +crilly: g4bittin: Sorry, did you manage to find a copy?
20:57  g4bittin: crilly: yes, needed to scroll down some more on ADC :p
20:57 +crilly: I knew they had it on there. I was about to login and see before you replied, but you've got it sorted now.
20:57 +crilly: WHich is good :)

22:06  kasi_: hi. some tricky question: is it possible to disable to left apple key?
22:07  kasi_: I want to train myself to use the right one instead
22:09  simplicity-: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/01/09/happy-fourth-birthday-iphone/ this is such a great keynote.
22:09  simplicity-: atleast those 10 mins of it.
22:13 +crilly: kasi_: I think you might be able to assign it to nothing?
22:13  kasi_: crilly: that's what I'm looking for
22:13  kasi_: crilly: how?
22:14 +crilly: kasi_: http://cl.ly/091f2i03212p3R2y2s2k - try that
22:14 +crilly: Set "Option" to "No Action"; although, that might disable both of them :(
22:15  kasi_: crilly: I know the pref pane, but it disables both
22:15  kasi_: crilly: I only want to disable one of them
22:15 +crilly: kasi_: Or, simply add an entry to http://cl.ly/3d3o1W3c3l2k401M0b3T defining the key as null?
22:16 +crilly: I'm not entirely sure you can without something detecting the left Option key on a global scale and cancelling its effect.
22:16  kasi_: crilly: but that requires a complete key stroke like command-tab
22:16  kasi_: I think it needs a kernel module
22:18  kasi_:  my best bet was doublecommand (http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/), but it's no longer supported and it doesn't support 10.6
22:22 +crilly: http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/2009/03/global-keyboard-shortcuts-with-carbon.html <- you could code something? :>
22:28  MaximusColourum: I use to use MacTheRipper to backup and play my DVD collection from my iMac. I forget what the newer suggestion was. I don't want to install Rosette just for MTR
22:30 +crilly: Handbrak.
22:30 +crilly: Handbrake.
22:30  MaximusColourum: Ah, that is what it was. It has been a long time.
22:30  MaximusColourum: Thank you so much.
22:30  MaximusColourum: I lost a drive and have a bunch of click and waiting to do.
22:31 +crilly: :]

22:55  Krisinu: any ipad owners out there?
22:56  Swian: I have one
22:56  Swian: well, its my wife's
22:57  Krisinu: cool, what do you guys use it for most?
22:57  Swian: surfing the web, netflix, chat, gaming
22:58  Krisinu: know if there's a way to do a remote connection form pc to ipad?
22:58  Swian: logmein.com
22:58  simplicity-: No
22:58  Swian: but that might be from iPad to pc
22:58  simplicity-: that will work from ipad to PC.
22:58  Swian: not the other way
22:58  Swian: why would you want to control an ipad remotely
22:59  Swian: its a remote device
22:59  Krisinu: considering getting my dad an ipad, he's 63, it'd be his first computer
22:59  Swian: if all he needs is browsing and such, good idea
22:59  Krisinu: i'm predicting there will be times he will get stuck on something and would be nice if i could remote in and do it
23:00  Swian: does he need portability?
23:00  Krisinu: browsing and email would be good, but also using some apps especially spreadsheets
23:00  Swian: because for cheaper than an iPad you can get a used mac mini
23:00  Krisinu: i think a traditional computer gives him anxiety
23:00  Krisinu: for him pointing is more natural, on my macbook he'll always go point at something on the screen
23:00  Swian: my dad is 73 and I just built him a pc
23:01  Swian: doesn't take long for them to get the hang
23:01  TheNavyBear: what is a good (open source preferably) program to cut/trim a video file?
23:02  Krisinu: doesn't one come with mac installed?
23:03  Krisinu: imovie?
23:03  Swian: imovie
23:07  Krisinu: just curious, what's the limitation of remote connecting pc to ipad/ipods?
23:08  Swian: remoting to ipod?
23:08  Swian: don't think so
23:08  Swian: and we already covered the ipad
23:10  Angostura: Krisinu: The main problem - you need a computer for Updates and the like
23:10  Swian: good point
23:10  Swian: you need itunes for some things
23:10  Swian: an ipad is not really a replacement for a computer
23:10  Krisinu: anything major?
23:10  Swian: yeah, software updates
23:11  simplicity-: It can be used.
23:11  Angostura: Krisinu: OS updates
23:11  Angostura: I think there are printers out there that allow direct printing now
23:11  Angostura: You buying him Pages?
23:12  Krisinu: i'd get him numbers
23:12  Swian: I wouldn't recommend an iPad as a computer
23:12  Swian: I think its fine as an extension for certain things
23:13  Angostura: I wouldn't recommend it as a computer, but I doubt Krisinu's dad wants a computer
23:13  Angostura: An information appliance, perhaps
23:13  temhawk: iPad is as good for a computer as an iPhone. it has a bigger screen, ok, but obviously it's the same software. some people don't realize that
23:13  danielgrieve: Swian: examples of those certain things?  Interested as I still don't see any room for it day-to-day, or even at all really (genuinely want to know in case I haven't thought of something!)
23:14  Angostura: temhawk: Until you try using one, it's not obvious what difference the screen size makes. In addition there are numerous productivity apps that are iPad only
23:14  Swian: you wouldn't want to write long documents on a ipad without a keyboard, screen is small, can't hold a lot of media
23:14  Krisinu: mobility is key as it's something he'll want to take between his carpentry shop and home, and possibly use it as a sales tool
23:15  Angostura: I've written about 1,000 words on an iPad on a flight, it was OK
23:15  Swian: I also do web development and graphics, most people also use the pc for photo editing
23:15  Swian: that's your opinion, I think typing on it is horrible
23:15  temhawk: Angostura: yeah. but it's way less powerful than a computer. i'm just saying, cause I know some people who thought they were getting full access to a filesystem and stuff...

23:15 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v crilly]
23:15  Angostura: Well, that's my  experience Swian 
23:16  Swian: I'm not saying its not a very cool device, but I could NOT replace a computer with it for my needs
23:16  danielgrieve: Swian: as someone who is in the same line of work, what do you use it for?
23:16  Swian: and I'd say most people I know are the same
23:16  Angostura: Omnigraffle for iPad is also rather splendid
23:16  Swian: I do web development
23:16  Swian: and graphic desig
23:16  Swian: design
23:17  Angostura: Swian: Which is why I said it is not a replacement for a computer. 
23:17  danielgrieve: yup, and you use the iPad for...? :D
23:17  Swian: I don't
23:17  Swian: my wife uses it
23:17  Angostura: I rather wish that there was a version of Balsamiq Mockups for iPad
23:17  Swian: I find it a neat item, but I can't think of a reason I'd need one
23:17  danielgrieve: aha, good.  I'm not missing some obvious gaping hole in which it can be of some benefit
23:18  Krisinu: Angostura: would that be useful for drawing blueprints?
23:18  Angostura: Only portability. I borrowed one when on a long flight to do some work
23:18  Angostura: Krisinu: Omnigraffle would be
23:18  Swian: and she has a mac mini too so she can do finances and graphics, photo editing
23:18  Angostura: Krisinu: But I'm not sure how he would get the plans out
23:19  Krisinu: export to pdf or print to a wireless network printer?
23:19  Swian: I'm a bit peeved it can't share itunes the way you can with other macs/pcs
23:24  Krisinu: i'll be taking the ol' man to best buy next weekend and we'll see what he chooses
23:24 * LaraX says bye to remyo
23:24  Krisinu: or might do apple store, hopefully those people would know the apps that would do what he wants to do
23:26  Angostura: 65 isn't really that old. My 86 year old dad copes with a Mac more or less

23:45  Angostura: MrUnagi: That's called 'Print to PDF'
23:45  MrUnagi: yea that wont work in this case =/
