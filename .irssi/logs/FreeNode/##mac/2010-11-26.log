00:00  DragonTurkey: aL3x, yeah its the capusle rebel. i bought black cuz they had limited choices. they just came out with a whole new selection of colors
00:00  DragonTurkey: http://www.switcheasy.com/store/?p=UorSXqhF&h=HijeXPG5LYs=&c=JMVAQ8zvdGmn
00:01  DragonTurkey: look how freaking sexy that blue and green looks
00:01  DragonTurkey: i want the blue one, but its out of stock
00:01  DragonTurkey: so i think ill get the green one before it goes out of stock too
00:03  aL3x: they look like alien rib cages
00:03  aL3x: i like the yellow one
00:04  DragonTurkey: yeah they are badass. my favorite phone cases of all time
00:04  DragonTurkey: it looks more like orange than yellow
00:05  aL3x: thats cause most people call lemon yellow, yellow
00:05  aL3x: real yellow is orangy
00:09  DragonTurkey: aL3x, you know another cool thing about astronomy. i always thought the big bang happened at a certain point in the sky. so u could look with a telescope at the origin point and maybe see what it looked like
00:09  DragonTurkey: but the big bang actually happened EVERYWHERE in the universe at the same instant
00:10  aL3x: i just recently found out the other day we can only see the stars in our own galaxy...like i dunno how that fact evaded me all my life
00:11  DragonTurkey: aL3x, you mean with the naked eye?
00:11  aL3x: yes and no; what i mean is stars in other galaxies arent all scattered about in the sky, but instead the entire galaxy would appear as a star
00:12  aL3x: i thought that when i look up at the sky, the stars coudl be from anywhere..
00:12  DragonTurkey: ahh yep. although the andromeda galaxy (our closest neighbor) is actually bigger than a star. it takes up a small patch in the sky u can see with the naked eye if u are in a remote enough place
00:14  DragonTurkey: aL3x, whats even cooler than that is the hubble deep field. a tiny point in the sky, which u cant even see as a star, up close, its millions of forming galaxies. they look like stars until u zoom in and they are tons of little infant galaxies
00:15  Angostura: The fact that the whole night sky isn't milky white was one of the early proofs that teh universe isn't infinite in extent
00:16  aL3x: have they even made a definate decision on its infinitness?
00:16  DragonTurkey: Angostura, or maybe it is but the light hasnt reached us yet :P
00:16  aL3x: more likely the light has been intercepted
00:16  DragonTurkey: aL3x, yes, by aliens :D
00:18  Angostura: DragonTurkey: Nice
00:23  DragonTurkey: ★ aL3x ★
00:23  DragonTurkey: look, some galaxies aorund you aL3x :P

09:33  richardcavell: I want to ask you about my MacBook battery.  It's the second battery I've had in this laptop.  The first one lasted about 350 cycles, and I replaced it a year ago.  Now I have this new one that's done 250 cycles.  I went on holiday for a week during which my laptop was powered down.  Normally it's on 24/7.  When I booted my MacBook for the first time, suddenly it says 'Service battery'.  It didn't go through any of the prior options
09:33  richardcavell: just straight to the last one.  iStat Pro says that the health of the battery is 75%.  Is this 'service battery' message reliable?
09:58  richardcavell: I've memoed him so that we can talk
10:45  voxadam: Is there any way to disable base 10 file sizes in 10.6 and go back to the proper way of base 2?

11:26  S_SubZero: Macbook Air and Macbook Pro?
11:38  topriddy: yup
11:38  CEnTR4L: Kasm279|Away, did you buy a 3.5" firewire enclosure? I keep postponing that forever, I'm buying today, hit me.
11:45  S_SubZero: topriddy: Air is smaller and slower.  Pro is bigger and faster.  one line enough?
11:45  topriddy: Pro is better then...
11:46  topriddy: i use a Pro anyways someone got an Air recently and it was cheaper than mine...
12:07 +LaraX: bigger isn't always better :)
12:19  Psixerces: It depends upon the use you want.   I recommended an air today, over a macbook or a macbook pro.

12:26  graziano: hello, I have a simple question about the iphone 3gs
12:26  graziano: when switched off and charging, should I see some led or indicator or it remains all black?
12:27  ahihi: guest326893: indeed
12:27  ahihi: guest326893: you should see the startup screen with the apple logo and then the charging icon
12:27  ahihi: err, graziano 
12:28  graziano: ahihi: even if the battery is fully discharged?
12:28  ahihi: IIRC it has a special screen for that
12:29  ahihi: haven't discharged mine in a while
12:30  _Dave123_: i have 7 pictures, and i would like to put these in an kind of clip with background music and a black sheet of text in between
12:30  _Dave123_: is there some tool for mac i can use to make a clip with this?
12:31  graziano: I mean, if the iphone 3gs is fully discharged and I plug it to charge it then when plugged I try to switch it on,  is it normal that it doesn't ?
12:31  graziano: or is it broken?
12:34  ahihi: it should show this http://demo.idg.com.au/images/pcw/inlineimages/210480-iphone-red-battery-screen_302_original.jpg
12:34  ahihi: google tells me it might take a few minutes for the screen to appear though
12:52  CEnTR4L: How to distinguish an upgrade version of Snow Leopard from a full one?
12:57  S_SubZero: you mean the DVD?
12:57  richardcavell: yeah
12:57  richardcavell: to tell the DVD from a full one or not?
12:57  richardcavell: And doesn't the upgrade version of SL work to do a fresh install anyway?
12:57  richardcavell: I bought an 'upgrade' from 10.5 to 10.6, and I had 10.4 installed, and was able to fresh install 10.6 from it

15:01  CEnTR4L: Branes, what do you think of Macally enclosure products?
15:27  HackeMate: can be linux installed in an imac in same way as windows?
15:27  HackeMate: or it's not legit
15:38 +Branes: CEnTR4L: Their drive enclosures are very very average, their firewire-based ones should be avoided as they use the godsawful Prolific chip.
15:40 +Branes: HackeMate: There's plenty of how-to's on the web for putting linux onto a Mac, but the best way is to put it inside a virtual machine (Oracle Virtualbox is free and highly recommended). Trying to run it directly on Apple hardware is a fast way to kill your CPU, thanks to Apple's annoying nonstandard power control chip.
15:43  HackeMate: hm okay, thanks
15:44  iaj: someone in here using irssi by chance?
15:44  Tsavo: I'm using Macirssi
15:48  ayaz: iaj: Yes!
15:49  iaj: ayaz: do you use notifactions from growl somehow?
15:52  ayaz: iaj: No, I don't.  One of the reasons why I use irssi is that I can run it in a tab in Terminal, and not let it bother me with notifications.  But, nevertheless, are you having issues with that?  There's an irssi-growl script just for that functionality.
15:53  iaj: ayaz: i tried that irssi-growl script - but the one I found is based on Growl::Mac
15:53  iaj: which I can't seem to be able to install
15:56  ayaz: iaj: There is one that depends on Net::Growl.  Have you tried installing the bundle via the CPAN shell?
15:58  iaj: ayaz: hmmm Mac::Growl I tried to install via cpan - no success
15:58  ayaz: iaj: Are you trying to use this script: https://github.com/kfdm/irssi-growl
16:00  iaj: ayaz: i installed Net::Growl.. grabbed the script.. tried to load it but get a : Can't locate Growl/GNTP.pm ...
16:00  ayaz: iaj: You will need to install the Growl::GNTP bundle as well.
16:02  iaj: ayaz: ahh thanks
16:02  iaj: ls
16:02  iaj: oops
16:03  iaj: ayaz: installed the GNTP thing.. but I still get errors :D
16:03  iaj: the same... can't locate growl/GNTP.pm in @INC...
16:03  iaj: Growl::GNTP is up to date. (0.07)   odd.
16:04 * CEnTR4L removed the an IDE & SATA 2.5" HDD firewire enclosures
16:04  ayaz: iaj: So, I take it that running `perl -MGrowl::GNTP` will fail with an error message about not being able to find the bundle.
16:04 * CEnTR4L from the cart
16:06  CEnTR4L: Branes, do you have any alternatives, looking for an IDE and SATA 2.5" HDD enclosures?
16:06  iaj: ayaz: not returning anything
16:07  iaj: -e 1 doesn't as well - so it seems to be working :s
16:07  CEnTR4L: Vantec seem to not have these.
16:07  ayaz: iaj: Yes, that would mean the bundle was found. 
16:07  iaj: ayaz: strange.
16:08 +Branes: CEnTR4L: Odd, because I've got both IDE and SATA 2.5" enclosures here made by Vantec. USB connectivity only, though.
16:09 +Branes: Hotway make a nice 2.5" enclosure that's FW+USB
16:09  CEnTR4L: I guess I'll go with Hotway then.
16:10  ayaz: iaj: You could try opening a new Terminal and running irssi from there.
16:10  CEnTR4L: I have just added http://www.amazon.com/Vantec-NST-400MX-UFB-3-5-Inch-Individual-Enclosure/dp/B001QFFYKO/ref=lh_ni_t_ to my cart, do you have a better one? it seems expensive to me...
16:11  iaj: ayaz: yeah.. its working in that other terminal - thanks for your help
16:11  iaj: so I have to reload irssi
16:12  ayaz: iaj: Yes, of course, because the @INC variable which contains the paths to search for bundles in will not have been updated.
16:12  ayaz: I am assuming that.
16:12 +Branes: CEnTR4L: I have one here called a "Mini G2" which does USB2+1394a+1394b, all aluminium, G5-like front grill. Not sure who makes them, but they use the excellent Oxford chipset.
16:13  ayaz: iaj: To be honest, I've not had much luck with other scripts on irssi on MacOS, due to the missing Irssi Perl package.  I fiddled around with Perl et al for a while, and gave up.  I now run it out of a Slackware VM from inside VMware Fusion.
16:14  ayaz: iaj: I thought, if I build irssi from source, I may have the foundation right, but the building from source part didn't get anywhere on MacOS.
16:15  CEnTR4L: No sign of Hotway enclosures in Amazon & newegg.
16:18  CEnTR4L: Branes, I have found this 2.5" firewire enclosure http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817729010&cm_re=2.5%22_firewire_enclosures-_-17-729-010-_-Product
16:21 +Branes: CEnTR4L: If you want to use firewire, it is *essential* you are sure the enclosure uses Oxford chips. Anything else will lose you data.
16:22  MrUnagi: anyone have any idea how to output 5.1 aac through the optical on a mac mini
16:22  CEnTR4L: MrUnagi, its complicated.
16:23  CEnTR4L: I've done it but I can't remember how.
16:23  CEnTR4L: Through iTunes?
16:23 +Branes: Tried searching the apple discussion forum thing?
16:23  MrUnagi: CEnTR4L: through anything
16:23  MrUnagi: Branes: yes the suggestions there didnt work for me
16:23  CEnTR4L: In VLC it works, buggy though.
16:24  MrUnagi: i find it odd that os x doesnt output it natively
16:24  CEnTR4L: I couldn't find a way through FrontRow
16:24 +Branes: Are you sure the program you're wanting multichannel audio from, and the media it is playing, actually have multichannel audio?
16:24  vxla: CEnTR4L: you won't "lose data"; don't listen to that guy
16:24  CEnTR4L: In iTunes, there's a way which you can find at Apple discussion forums.
16:24  MrUnagi: Branes: yes
16:25  CEnTR4L: Branes, I have failed to find these, any brand/model in your mind that is still manufacturing that?
16:26  MrUnagi: interesting
16:26  MrUnagi: works n boxee
16:26  MrUnagi: odd vlc has issues
16:26 +Branes: Yes; Sarotec, Hotway, whomever makes the Mini G2 (Macpower, or whatever their new name is), Welland.
16:28  AlHafoudh: hi all
16:28 +Branes: After having to deal with up to half a dozen drives with lost or corrupted data because they were in an enclosure that did not use Oxford chipsets, we stopped selling them. I still have one or two a month I have to remove the drive from and put into a decent Oxford-bearing enclosure -- we use Vantec 2.5 and the Mini G2 2.5" for that.
16:28 +Branes: err, Vantec 3.5
16:28  AlHafoudh: can I delete whole date folders from *.backupdb backups?
16:29 +Branes: Sure. it'll totally destroy your entire Time Machine backup, though, and you'll have to start over.
16:29  AlHafoudh: Branes: ok, how can I clean it up ?
16:30  Angostura: Branes: Is there a simple way to check whether by external uses Oxford?
16:30  Angostura: (nothing indicates ye or nay in Profiler
16:30  gucko: guys I'm just one step to buy my MBP! One question plzzz: How much would it cost to ship a MBP from Texas to NYC (Manhatten)? Which company please?
16:30  daddysmurf: I'm brand new to mac, but overall, quite computer-savy. I was recently given a macbook with a busted hard drive, a dvd of snow leopard (I think), and an image of the same dvd. Additionally, I have a linux laptop, a linux netbook (which will probably be donating a hdd soon), and access to a windows box. Is it possible to boot the macbook over network from the linux box using pxe or something similar? if so, what should I look up?
16:31  MrUnagi: my bad Branes 
16:31  MrUnagi: i didnt expect vlc to not output the stream
16:31  MrUnagi: boxee does just fine
16:31  MrUnagi: thats all that really matters to me
16:31 +Branes: AlHafoudh: Time Machine automatically drops old dates "off the end" when it runsout of space on the storage volume. It's a bit brain-dead that way, but that's how it was designed.
16:31  vxla: daddysmurf: you won't be able to install in that manner
16:32 +Branes: Angostura: Probably, but I've never known what it might be -- I always open the case and eyeball the chip, if I'm unsure.
16:32  daddysmurf: vxla: so I have to get a dvd and burn?
16:32  Angostura: OK, thanks
16:33  vxla: daddysmurf: you need the installation DVD? you can get one from Apple directly.
16:33  gucko: please guys, this is so important :(
16:33 +Branes: daddysmurf: Apple's hardware is slightly but annoyingly non-standard. It's possible to boot from a USB key with the OSX installer on it, but you need a working Mac to create said key in the first place.
16:33  Angostura: He's got the snow leopard DVD
16:34  Angostura: gucko: If it's that important - phone around
16:34  daddysmurf: Branes: you're breaking my heart..
16:34 +Branes: gucko: I doubt anyone here would be able to tell you that -- best you contact the place you're buying from.
16:34  daddysmurf: vxla: I have a backup of the dvd that was installed
16:36  vxla: daddysmurf: sorry, I mis-read what you wrote.
16:36  gucko: Branes: no no. The problem is that I have a friend who lives in Texas. I want to type his address in Amazon to ship the laptop to him. Then he's gonna ship it to a friend in NYC Manhatten. I'm just wondering about the costs, or the available companies in the US for shipping. Please don't ask why I want to do that. It's a long story :(
16:36 +Branes: daddysmurf: Use the DVD installer you were given to try and boot the machine. If it doesn't, you'll need either another copy of the machine-specific installer discs (about $20 from Apple direct, if you ring the support line) or a 10.6 Snow Leopard disc from any Apple reseller

16:38  vxla: OK I give up: wtf is "Communicating with Gracenote" when trying to import a CD into iTunes?
16:38  daddysmurf: Branes: ty
16:38  vxla: is this some half-witted attempt at DRM?
16:38 +Branes: Apple being Apple, they *love* to change things to suit themselves - PXE doesn't work. You can netboot a Mac only if the machine you want to boot from is another Mac running OSX Server ... the only exception is brand new laptops with Remote Disc built into their firmware.
16:38 +Branes: vxla: It is doing track lookup for you.
16:38  gucko: anybody pleaes?
16:39  vxla: I thought that only happens once, not after I insert all my own DB info on the disc.
16:39 +Branes: Gracenote = the commercialised version of "cddb", which Apple pay money to every year.
16:40 +Branes: It happens all the time, if iChewns is at all unsure it'll interrogate Gracenote/cddb until it gets a disc-id match.
16:40  vxla: junk.
16:41 +Branes: Yes, iTunes is junk :)
16:41  daddysmurf: as much as I love woz, and as bad as I want a commercial desktop nix, apples are rather annoying... but a challenge is a challenge none-the-less
16:42 +Branes: Ha. Woz had *nothing* to do with Apple or MacOS in its current form. Hell, he had almost nothing to do with the Mac from the beginning.
16:42  vxla: 70% of the CDDB info for discs I rip (classical) is incorrect. and CDDB corrections hardly ever get accepted upstream
16:43 +Branes: same goes for freedb too - whomever gets in with the disc first is the winner, usually, even if they make a total balls-up of it.
16:44  llrcombs: What should I do if I got a kernel panic at approximately 12:00:18 this morning, and it's not reported in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ ?
16:45 +Branes: Go buy a real Mac?
16:45  Tsavo: approximately 12:00:18
16:45  llrcombs: (that's when the last console message of the night went through)
16:47  llrcombs: 2 days ago, I got 2 KP's in one day, but WebKit Nightlies claimed responsibility for both
16:47  DragonTurkey: 12:00:18 is approximate? does that mean you are unsure of how many milliseconds?
16:47  DragonTurkey: lol

16:47 +Branes: kernel panics are hardware related 99% of the time. if you had a real machine instead of that hackintoy you seem inordinately fond of for some inexplicable reason, you'd know this :)
16:48  LordDragon: how do you know its a hackintosh Branes ?
16:48  Tsavo: That's what I was hinting at LordDragon 
16:49  llrcombs: DragonTurkey+Tsavo: Well, it could have occurred afterward, but there hadn't been a new console message sent between 12:00:18 and whatever time the KP happened
16:49  LordDragon: perhaps Branes is just trolling
16:49 +Branes: LD: he admitted as much in channel about four months ago.
16:49  Tsavo: Yah I got it llrcombs it's just mysteriously put.
16:49  Tsavo: Good memory
16:50  CEnTR4L: Apparently they're only selling those in Australia.
16:50  LordDragon: hackintosh support is not permitted in here
16:50  LordDragon: we only support real macss
16:50  Tsavo: Ok. I plugged in my headphones to my late '06 macbook and it totally froze
16:50  llrcombs: well, I cam here because I thought it might've been software (seeing as WebKit claimed responsibility for the last 2)

16:51  LordDragon: llrcombs, buy a real mac and we'll be happy to help :)
16:51  llrcombs: adieu
16:51  llrcombs: oh, by the way
16:51  LordDragon: yeah yeah
16:51  LordDragon: blah blah
16:51  LordDragon: bye llrcombs ;)
16:51  llrcombs: I own a MacBook, and the rest of my family have "real macs"
16:51  gucko: guys what's the most popular Mac Virtualization Software?
16:52  LordDragon: gucko, i thought you were here to troll about android
16:52  gucko: LordDragon: :S
16:52 +Branes: ... he says, having seen him boast about helping provide his family with hackintossed Dell9's on another network :)
16:52  gucko: LordDragon: that was ages ago man
16:53  gucko: LordDragon: but I would still reask that question again
16:53  gucko: LordDragon: if you found an answer for me, please tell it :)
16:53  LordDragon: gucko, well whether you trolled yesterday or weeks ago, i dont speak to trolls
16:53  Tsavo: Popularity is relative. Try Virtualbox since it's free gucko 
16:53 +Branes: gucko: Fusion is the best VM solution for running a Windows on a Mac.
16:54  gucko: Branes: so should I forget about Paralles?
16:54 +Branes: Virtualbox would be the best way of running a linux (et al) distro.
16:54  Tsavo: but yes, I've heard that Fusion has higher efficiency than Virtualbox
16:54 +Branes: Parallels is faster than Fusion, but OSX performance suffers.
16:55  Tsavo: So if you have a late '06 macbook with low specs, VB is the way to go
16:56 +Branes: call it 'vbox' for short. To me, 'VB' means both 'Visual BASIC' and 'Victoria Bitter' -- both 'Very Bad'.
16:57  Tsavo: yah i was thinking about that as i typed it. in this context i guess you should know it means vbox
16:57  Tsavo: although, in my case, the only reason i run windows under virtualbox is for visualbasic for my class
