15:36  bushwakko: for anyone having troubles with mouse accel, mouse lag, mouse jitter or similar issues, please add your comments here: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2653179&stqc=true
15:36  bushwakko: I made that thread now because I'm sooo tired of having my main os just _feeel_ slow, because of input issues
15:41  koro: bushwakko: did you try the mouse acceleration preference pane? http://triq.net/mac/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x
15:41  koro: i use that and it mainly makes it feel acceptable
15:42  bushwakko: I use USB Overdrive
15:42  koro: but i know what you mean...
15:42  bushwakko: it's acceptable
15:42  bushwakko: or it's usable
15:42  bushwakko: it's unacceptable
15:42  bushwakko: as I said in my post
15:42  koro: yeah, i heard this one is better; i never tried usb overdrive
15:42  bushwakko: using synergy via the network with the mouse plugged into another computer is way better
15:42  bushwakko: that says it all really
15:43  bushwakko: I tried that pane
15:43  bushwakko: but you have to set it to like -0.5 or something right?
15:43  koro: lemme check
15:43  bushwakko: I think usb overdrive is better
15:44  koro: no, there's a newer version
15:44  koro: (one from 2010)
15:44  WormFood: what does the orange/green light on the power adapter (for a laptop) mean? I'm guessing orange is charging the battery, and green is charged or standby...is that correct? (please forgive the noobish question, just rarely get a real mac in my hands)
15:44  koro: yes
15:45  koro: and if it's blinking orange it means it's about to xplode. Toss it as far as you can and start running.
15:45  WormFood: cool! how do I enable that mode?
15:47  WormFood: when the laptop is connected to the charger, even if the battery is dead, it should turn on, right? (I'm thinking maybe this old mac is dead)
15:47  koro: i think so
15:48  WormFood: I'd be rather surprised if it didn't work that way, I just wanted some confirmation before I assumed the wrong thing.
15:48  Kasm279|Away: WormFood: what Mac is this?
15:49  WormFood: i sec, let me get the model number
15:49  WormFood: 1*
15:49  Kasm279|Away: just tell me what it says under the screen
15:49  Kasm279|Away: well
15:49  Kasm279|Away: get both lol
15:49  Kasm279|Away: anyway
15:49  WormFood: Macbook A1181
15:49  Kasm279|Away: im outta here
15:49  Kasm279|Away: oh ok
15:49  Kasm279|Away: later
15:49  WormFood: what screen? it won't turn on
15:50  WormFood: I just wanted to make sure it was really dead, and not operator error ;)
15:50  Kasm279|Away: untwre the screen
15:50  Kasm279|Away: under*
15:50  Kasm279|Away: on the frame
15:50  Kasm279|Away: anyway
15:50  Kasm279|Away: later
15:50  WormFood: yeah, "MacBook"
15:51  Angostura: So, you have a Macbook that appears to be charging - but no activity when the power button is pressed?
15:52  WormFood: correct
15:52  Angostura: Any idea roughly how old?
15:52  WormFood: it had a piece of junk on the seating area, that was preventing the plug from making contact...I was really hoping that was the problem, but maybe it was just coincidence
15:53  WormFood: no idea how old, but it looks well used...the touchpad is worn smooth
15:53  Angostura: does it have a removable batter underneath?
15:53  WormFood: yes
15:53  Angostura: battery, even
15:53  WormFood: and they just got a replacement battery, and the new one is in it....perhaps I should try the old one
15:54  Angostura: OK 1. Take the battery out and disconnect from the power
15:54  WormFood: the dropped in the new battery, and it didn't turn on, so they brought it to me...they said the new battery is fully charged, but honestly, I doubt it.
15:54  WormFood: ok
15:54  Angostura: 2. Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds
15:54  Angostura: (this will reset the power management unit)
15:55  WormFood: cool...I thought there may be something like this going on with it, that is why I asked here ;)
15:55  Angostura: Then pop the battery back in, reconnect to the power and press the button
15:55  WormFood: brb, let me try this
15:55  Angostura: /me crosses various extremities
15:55  Angostura: whoops :-)
15:57  WormFood: hhhmmm...appears to be no change
15:57  Angostura: There are a couple of other things to try if that doesn't work
15:57  WormFood: is this stuff all documented somewhere on the web?
15:57  Angostura: Google is your friend. http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1365
15:57  WormFood: I appreciate your help, but hate to waste your time....
15:58  WormFood: google is NOT my friend, if I don't know the right keywords to search for ;)
15:58  Angostura: If I didn't want my time wasted, I wouldn't be hanging out on IRC :-)
15:58  WormFood: good answer ;)
15:58  Angostura: The magic phrase I typed into Google was: "macbook will not turn on"
15:58  Angostura: good eh?
15:58 * WormFood has been wasting time on IRC since 1994
15:59  Angostura: And still sane
15:59  Angostura: must be some kind of record
15:59  WormFood: yeah, makes sense, but my search requests tend to be more terse...probably from my days of massaging alta-vista to give me the results I wanted, before google
15:59  Angostura: I was more an infoseek man myself
15:59  spline: wormfood=old school
16:00  WormFood: you following me around spline?
16:00  Angostura: Nah, if it was OldSkool he would be using Gopher and Archie
16:00  WormFood: I was using gopher and archie (and veronica)
16:00  spline: wormfood conducts his google searches with telnet www.google.com 80
16:00  WormFood: I never used jughead, but I was aware of the service
16:00  Angostura: Anyway - have a look at that support doc and see if anything works
16:01  spline: or maybe a little #import <arpa/tcp.h> 
16:01  Angostura: and comp.sci.macintosh
16:01  WormFood: ok Angostura, I'm checking it out now.
16:03  WormFood: this must be old...there is no power meter on the battery
16:04  Angostura: Odd, there have been battery meters on them since before there were MacBooks - my old iBook had a battery meter
16:04  Angostura: perhaps the replacement battery is sourced from a 3rd party, not a proper Apple one
16:05  WormFood: it says it is an apple..of course, it could be counterfeit, but it does not feel like it...it feels sturdy
16:06  Angostura: OK.
16:07  Angostura: Is this a white Macbook?
16:08  Angostura: Shou;d be something like this: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MA561LL/A
16:14  WormFood: no, it is black, 13"
16:14  WormFood: so far, nothing I've tried works...
16:14  WormFood: now this is interesting...
16:15  WormFood: I plug in the original battery, and now the charger is green...does not go to orange....anyways, still does not turn on...but still reading that page
16:19  WormFood: I've tried everything on the list, except an extended power adapter test...going over that now, but I sorta doubt it is the problem
16:19  Angostura: WormFood: the chap to really ask, if he's about is Branes - he knows all
16:19  Angostura: ... in Australia so is active at odd hours
16:20  Angostura: (well, not odd if you're in Oz)
16:20  WormFood: well, then he should have my hours...I'm in east China :P
16:20  Angostura: lawks
16:20  WormFood: some of OZ is the same time zone as me (oddly enough, china does not use time zones...the whole country uses one official time zone, and then different locals use a local time)
16:21  WormFood: locales*
16:22  Angostura: I did not know that.  So people in the East of China typically get into the office earlier than those in the West/
16:22  Angostura: ?
16:22  WormFood: right
16:22  Angostura: Im am educated. See? hanging out on IRC has its benefits
16:23  WormFood: but there is only one official time for the whole country....so if you get the time wrong, you can't use time zones or gaylight "savings" time as an excuse

16:49  ashp: I updated to 3.2 this morning and osx is completely fucked for me to the point that I will have to reboot.
16:51  WormFood: Angostura, this is a late 2006 model MacBook
16:53  Angostura: WormFood: Hmmm - http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/MacBook_Late2006_UsersGuide.pdf see page 26 about the battery, including indicator lights
16:53  WormFood: great Angostura, thanks 
16:54  WormFood: that was the next thing I was going to do (get the manual)
16:56  ashp: damn, I guess nobody has seen any problems with bootcamp then, grr.  I had to clear the PRAM to get it to start, and then a few minutes after running everything beachballs until I reset.  Nothing in console, activity viewer looks fine, hardware tests worked ok, I repaired permissions/verified the drive
16:56  ashp: is there anything else I can try that people can think of?
16:57  ashp: i've never had a problem before, everything has been fine, the only change was bootcamp :/
17:02  WormFood: well damn, I learned something new too...this battery does have the power meter...I just didn't know what to look for
17:03  WormFood: well shit! it looks like this computer is D E A D!
17:03  WormFood: thank you so much for your help Angostura 
17:04  Absolute0: Are there any benefits for a developer to use mac instead of linux?
17:04  WormFood: I'm gonna step out of here, and install OSX on my new IBM laptop (don't worry, I won't ask for help here) ;) and then go to bed...see ya'll later (it is midnight here)
17:05  WormFood: Absolute0, it depends on what platforms you're developing for....unless you have special tools that only work on one or the other, I don't see any real benefit or disadvantage to one or the other (personally, I'm a Linux guy, so I would go with Linux, but if you like OSX more, then go for it)
17:06  Absolute0: I am a linux guy myself.
17:07  zer0her0: my problem w/ linux on laptops is the power management generally is horrendous
17:07  Absolute0: My new job is asking me to choose between a pc or a mac.
17:08  Absolute0: With pc linux installation is a breeze.
17:08  zer0her0: i'd choose mac, unless they would let me run linux.
17:08  zer0her0: i wonder what laptops Google gives out...
17:08  Absolute0: whatever you want
17:08  Absolute0: i think its macs and thinkpads
17:08  zer0her0: would make sense
17:09  zer0her0: i know it's MBP, but all my googler friends run Mac so i don't know what the linux option is
17:09  Absolute0: you can run linux on mac
17:09  zer0her0: Absolute0: it's not suggested
17:09  Absolute0: it's not?
17:10  Absolute0: well there's always virtualization
17:10  zer0her0: no, apple hasn't opened up docs on how they handle power on their boards.
17:10  zer0her0: so linux will run the process at full power.
17:10  Absolute0: apple is uptight and doesn't want you to think on your own. :)
17:10  zer0her0: yea i run vmware fusion and virtualbox
17:11  Angostura: WormFood: Sorry it wasn't a happier outcome

I see with running with the KB off, after clearing off the dust and verifying that I can spin the fan with a screwdriver, that the fan moves ever so slightly every few seconds.

19:46  crilly: Yeah, but do they last more than six months of heavy usage?
19:47  Tu13es: yes
19:47  bassliner: crilly: very likely.
19:48  S_SubZero: my point was coming onto a global network and, without any indication of local currency, asking about "cheap" is hopeless.

19:48  S_SubZero: dollars?  pounds?  euros?  what?
19:48  Tu13es: i just always assume US
19:48  bassliner: zer0her0: 275mb/sec writing.

19:49  bassliner: zer0her0: http://www.heise.de/preisvergleich/a534348.html - page is in german tho
19:49  bassliner: zer0her0: probably not the best ssd you could get right now.
19:49  bassliner: but, it will very likely last as long as a real hd.
19:50  zer0her0: that's 60
19:51  zer0her0: and you can pick up a matching HDD for half that SSD ;)

19:59  S_SubZero: cost?  
19:59  Marctraider: i dunno i thought perhaps power consumption/noise versus performance?
20:00  Marctraider: since apple tries everything to prolong their battery life :p
20:00  Marctraider: brb
20:00  torchie: hmm is it really a power consumption issue?
20:01  zer0her0: yea mostly it's just costs

20:15  torchie: such open source hate
20:15  zer0her0: crilly: why are you contemplating a kindle?
20:15  zer0her0: i love mine
20:16  crilly: zer0her0: How can you tell what books on Amazon are Kindle-compatiable/available?
20:17  zer0her0: crilly: http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=sa_menu_kbo3?ie=UTF8&node=1286228011
20:17  crilly: Ah there's a "Kindle Store" section. OK
20:17  crilly: Books are a lot cheaper too.
20:18  zer0her0: :)
20:18  crilly: Which I think is something the movie/music/tv studios need to pay attention
20:18  crilly: "There's no physical media or physical logistics to worry about - it should be cheaper, therefore".
20:19  crilly: zer0her0: Odd though, how electric copies of printed works are subject to VAT, but printed books aren't :/
20:20  zer0her0: physical media/logistics are rarely dealt w/ by companies that you purchase from though
20:20  zer0her0: though servers are their concern
20:20  zer0her0: so that thought process prices should be inverted ;)
20:20  CPng|N:  one cost replaces another
20:20  zer0her0: crilly: not in the land of the free ;)
20:21  crilly: The costs surrounding transporting goods from one side of the world to another far outweigh those of running a server farm.
20:22  crilly: zer0her0: Some Kindle edition books are more expensive than the printed version?
20:22  crilly: zer0her0: Where do you get your books from?
20:23  zer0her0: crilly: i wasn't aware i was signing packages from amazon-shipping, i swore the guys jacket and truck said UPS
20:23  zer0her0: ;)
20:24  zer0her0: fiction: Amazon, tech books: oreilly/pragpub's websites
20:27  crilly: zer0her0: And you don't think UPS charge Amazon? You need a lesson in logistics sweet cheeks.
20:28  crilly: Because the customer doesn't pay it, given that delivery is free on every product if you're willing to wait.
20:28  zer0her0: crilly: my bill says shipping: $x.xx
20:28  crilly: Gutted. Sucks to be in the US then, because in the UK shipping is free from Amazon.
20:28  zer0her0: unless i choose super slow week wait shipping or pay for prim
20:29  crilly: We can pay premium here too; the "slow" one add an extra day on.
20:29  zer0her0: yea in the US if you choose the free shipping it literally will sit for a day or two before they hand it to UPSE
20:29  zer0her0: UPS*
20:30  zer0her0: me and my friend ordered some game, same time, delivered to the same street(he live next door) he had prime, i didn't, he got notice his shipped that eve, mine didn't get the notice for 2 days.
20:30  npoektop: hi! i've just did rm -fr a dir. Is there a way to recover it?
20:31  zer0her0: npoektop: no
20:31  zer0her0: hopefully you have a backup

20:51  Amaterasu-chan: hi, hmm I got several mac on my network and in finder I see them under the 'shared' thingy.. what would be the path to one of the other macs?
20:52  crilly: Amaterasu-chan: If you right-click and do "Get Info", do you get that information?
20:52  Amaterasu-chan: no
20:53  Amaterasu-chan: I wanna run an apple script and save some files on my other mac...
20:53  Amaterasu-chan: do I need to map up a network drive or something to do this maybe?
20:56  Amaterasu-chan: hmmm
20:58  Amaterasu-chan: just need the path...
20:59  crilly: Yeah create a share on the other Mac(s) and that share should appear
20:59  Amaterasu-chan: it does, but I need the path info for my script
21:01  Amaterasu-chan: or at least some way of syncing files the script makes on the fly...
21:06  Amaterasu-chan: hmm ok, think I did it

21:40  masu3701: is there a way to have my terminal look like the one in linux?
21:40  masu3701: colored folder 
21:41  masu3701: in mac everything is just 1 color
21:43  S_SubZero: I used the "Google" search engine and found this. http://www.geekology.co.za/blog/2009/04/enabling-bash-terminal-directory-file-color-highlighting-mac-os-x/
21:44  sontek: Would a macbook require a specific version of OSX to even boot into the installer?
21:44  S_SubZero: sontek: yes.
21:44  sontek: I have OSX 10.6.2 and it came with 10.6.4, but it wont get past loading the apple logo
21:45  koro: sontek: you mean the 10.6.4 installer doesn't get past the logo?
21:45  masu3701: S_SubZero: try that but didnt work
21:45  S_SubZero: if it came with 10.6.4 it's meant to be used with 10.6.4.  I do know the installer takes a long time to load.
21:46 --- Amaterasu is now known as Amaterasu-chan
21:47  Amaterasu-chan: awww its working! =)
21:47  sontek: koro: No, 10.6.2 installer wont load
21:47  sontek: I figured it'd at least be able to load the installer off the disc
21:47  sontek: and then complain about being too old or something
21:47  sontek: but it doesn't get past the apple logo
21:47  sontek: no spinning loading icon or anything
21:49  koro: i'd say the disk is b0rken
21:49  koro: it should work
21:50  sontek: Tried multiple discs though
21:50  sontek: even did external harddrive boot
21:53  sontek: Its a refurb so it doesn't seem like 10.6.4 would be required, but 10.6.3 wont boot either
21:54  sontek: its an i5
21:59  sontek: is there a way to find out what version ships with macbook pro's with core i5
22:00  crilly: The latest version
22:00  crilly: It's always the latest realase with a new Mac.
22:00  crilly: Why would it be any other way? :/
22:01  antlong: how can i hide specific file extensions from being shown in terminal
22:01  crilly: I don't know how you hide specific extensions; I know you can hide them all, or not at all.
22:02  antlong: isnt there like a .hidden in sl
22:02  crilly: I don't know. It's not something I've ever looked into.
22:03  PaulB: where can I get help with illustrator
22:03  crilly: ##design
22:05  sontek: antlong: use grep
22:05  sontek: antlong: ls |grep -v py
22:05  sontek: to exclude python files
22:06  antlong: pyc is the problem, ty will give it a shot
22:06  crilly: Oh I thought you meant in Finder. bah
22:08  antlong: sontek, how do i add multiple extensions to that command

22:36  sontek: does 10.6.4 even come as a retail disk?
22:37  crilly: Probably an upgrade disc.
22:37  GarryFre: The letters T and G are very close to each other on a keyboard. This recently became all too apparent to me and consequently I will never be ending a work email with the phrase "Regards" again.
22:39  crilly: Yep. I've done that before now. "Kind retards, Mike".
22:40  sr0z: haha
