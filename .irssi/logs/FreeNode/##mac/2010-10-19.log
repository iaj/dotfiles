00:00  salamandyr: anyone know how to "fix" the volumne keys (f10-f12) on my new imac?  they are doing expose stuff, not volumne, and i cannot figure out where to reset this
00:00  Tomis: because you're using some wacky theme KeeperOfTheSoul ?
00:00  Tomis: switch your fn setting salamandyr 
00:00  KeeperOfTheSoul: no, standard terminal windows and macvim
00:00  salamandyr: Tomis - i would, if i could find the settin
00:00  Tomis: sounds like you ticked the box to reverse the meaning of fn
00:00  Tomis: system prefs>keyboard
00:00  salamandyr: ya.. i don't see that box actually
00:01  Tomis: read through the checkboxes there, you'll see it
00:01  salamandyr: no, actuall - the system pref pane is pretty abbreviated
00:01  salamandyr: it's not there
00:01  salamandyr: looks like the imac is having issues ID'ing the wireless kbd
00:02  Tomis: then you can't do anything about it i guess
00:02  salamandyr: it's the kbd that came with the machine.. 
00:02  Tomis: does the keyboard have an fn key?
00:02  salamandyr: yes
00:02  salamandyr: doesn't work though
00:02  Tomis: then you should see the checkbox
00:02  salamandyr: the imac is having probs identifying the kbd
00:02  richardcavell: salamandyr: you hold down fn and press the Fx key
00:02  Tomis: don't know what you tell you at this point
00:02  richardcavell: you can assign each of the function keys its own function manually
00:02  Tomis: try redetecting the keyboard maybe?
00:03  salamandyr: richardcavell.. doesn't work
00:03  salamandyr: tomis.. tried. no joy.
00:03  richardcavell: salamandyr: in my keyboard settings I can manually assign a function to each Fx key
00:03  Tomis: mmm
00:03  salamandyr: richardcavell.. this is a problem "before" that, if you will
00:03  KeeperOfTheSoul: so yeah, drop shadow + black backgrounds = fail
00:04  Tomis: don't use a black desktop background and black windows then i guess KeeperOfTheSoul 
00:04  Tomis: i use semi-transparent black on my terminal
00:04  KeeperOfTheSoul: Tomis: not desktop background, other windows
00:04  KeeperOfTheSoul: Tomis: my terminal is black, my code editor is black, macvim is black, and they all sort of merge
00:07  Tomis: gross
00:08  KeeperOfTheSoul: beets having everything bright white
00:08  Tomis: or just leave it on he defaults and hit cmd-option-control-8
00:09  KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah, that just looks odd, I mean I do like colour when surfing the internet
00:09  KeeperOfTheSoul: just not in my text editors
00:09  Tomis: it is in color
00:09  Tomis: just inverted
00:09  Tomis: makes life more interesting
00:09  KeeperOfTheSoul: I sometimes like inverting the colours on my iPad, people can't work it out
00:11  Tomis: invert all the screens at the apple store
00:11  KeeperOfTheSoul: speaking of which, would be nice if it had a shortcut to enable/disable cellular data
00:12  Tomis: then sit back and find out which employees know their crap or not
00:44  alexbobP: what can I do in mac os x to lock the screen?
00:44  alexbobP: so that someone needs a password to use it
00:44  alexbobP: it happens after 1 minute of screensaver, but I want to lock immediately
00:46  Angostura: alexbobP: Easiest thing its to set a hotcorner for the Screensaver
00:47  Angostura: and set the screensaver to require a password
00:47  remyo: alexbobP: Open Keychain Access > Go to Preferences > General > Show Status in Menu Bar
00:47  CPng|N: I have 1 for SS and another corner for sleep monitor. super handy
00:47  remyo: Then you'll have a handy Lock screen button from the menu bar
00:47  Angostura: Or you can just use fast user switching to return to the login screen
00:48  Tu13es: alexbobP: System Preferences > Security > Lock screen > immediately
00:49  alexbobP: I don't want my screen saver to lock my screen immediately when it starts on timer though
00:49  remyo: alexbobP: Try my way. I think you'll like it
00:49  Tu13es: ok, so then the above suggestions
00:49  alexbobP: remyo: thanks!
00:49  alexbobP: works great
00:50  remyo: No problem... ;)
00:50 * alexbobP wonders if that winky signifies some nefarious little quirk of remyo's advice
00:50  mrh: maybe he wants to have sex with you
00:51  remyo: Yeah. The third time you lock the screen the computer explodes
00:51  Angostura: Nope, just an indication that he knows you want to hide the screen because you are surfing porn
00:51  alexbobP: hehe, yup
00:53  remyo: I used to work with a creepy guy that would browse your computer if you weren't around. Lock screens can be useful against people like that
00:58  alexbobP: yeah, that's pretty much the threat model they're for
00:58  alexbobP: people who will try to use your computer but who aren't you
00:58  _kafka: hey, im new to mac, how do i edit a system file with root permission?
00:58  _kafka: like sudo
00:58  alexbobP: can't have that creepy guy finding your porn!
00:58  alexbobP: _kafka: in terminal or in the gui?
00:58  _kafka: gui
00:59  alexbobP: oh... I dunno then
01:00  _kafka: hrhr
01:00  _kafka: ok terminal then
01:00  alexbobP: "sudo"
01:00  alexbobP: just run any command with sudo
01:00  alexbobP: or for a root shell, do "sudo su" or "sudo bash", or "sudo su -" to load root's profile
01:00  remyo: _kafka: In Finder, Get Info on the file, scroll all the way down and click the lock 
01:00  remyo: Thats the gui way 
01:00  remyo: But you shouldn't be editing system files :p
01:01  _kafka: i know how to edit in linux
01:01  _kafka: just new to mac
01:02  remyo: Theres a reason the system files are locked and you have a home directory
01:02  remyo: But whatever... :| 
01:02  FriedBob: remyo: If he hoses his system he can fix it. 
01:03  alexbobP: those files are locked so that if your friend borrows your laptop he can't mess up the whole system without your password
01:03  remyo: I know. I've just found theres almost never a reason to fuck with system files. 99% of the time theres a better way
01:03  alexbobP: it's not so that you can't use your own computer... this isn't an iphone!
01:03  alexbobP: remyo: not even stuff in /etc?
01:03  alexbobP: that's usually full of config files that you often want to edit
01:04  remyo: Meh
01:05  remyo: _kafka: Have fun
01:05  _kafka: thanks
01:05  _kafka: already got what i needed
01:05  FriedBob: Let's hope he makes a backup before he changes anything...
01:06  mrh: cant you just reinstall with the osx disk worst case senario?
01:06  mrh: i'm new to this whole mac thing, but that would be my first assumption.
01:06  remyo: You can, but you shouldn't have to
01:06  FriedBob: Yeah, but it's better to just restore a backup of a few files if you can.
01:07  mrh: ah. fair enough
01:25  fleebailey33: FriedBob: hows the job
01:25  FriedBob: fleebailey33: Dunno yet, orientation is tomorrow
01:25 --- WarpZone_ is now known as WarpZone
01:25  fleebailey33: awesome
01:26  CPng|N: yay for jobs
01:28  FriedBob: Indeed. I hope this works outr
01:34  CPng|N: where at?
01:39  koro: Uh this is ridiculous.
01:39  John____: hello, I got a question
01:40  John____: I got the iPhone 4, I have showed it to a friend of mine and he has passed it out to all of his family for them to see while I was minding my own business doing something else without worries
01:40  koro: It seems that when the clock in a macbook changes automatically due to daylight saving time, some part of mac OS doesn't play well with it. After going through a daylight saving time change, i put my macbook to hibernate and when i woke it up hell broke loose, my time was reset to factory settings, my wifi netwowrks info disappeared, etc.
01:40  John____: when I get the iPhone 4 back I see i got restrictions on with a passcode that I never entered. I already have 10 failed attempts and tells me to try again in another 60 minutes
01:41  John____: how do I remove restrictions passcode? I've read the only way is to do a reset on the iPhone but a question for this
01:41  koro: I looked up and people in the US had the same problem earlier this year, when there was a time chnage in the US.
01:41  koro: How lame is that.
01:41  Angostura: koro: Sounds like corrupted PRAM or somesuch
01:42  koro: Yeah that's what this behavior is usually a sign of.
01:42  koro: But *when* there is a time change, this is a one-time event.
01:42  John____: does resetting my iPhone 4 reset everything like, for example, for my purchased games like Zenonia 2 does it erase my saved games and that sort of stuff?
01:43  Angostura: A complete factory reset would vape the lot, yes
01:43  John____: =(
01:44  John____: my huge mistake to give out my iphone for people to see. I'm never doing that again.
01:45  Angostura: John____: But you will have backups of the phone in iTunes, I presume
01:45  koro: John____: you just got owned.
01:45  koro: Angostura: is it possible to reset "to the last backup" of the phone?
01:45  koro: without going through a full reset ?
01:45  koro: i never used backups
01:46  Angostura: I think  how it works is....
01:46  Angostura: if you do a complete reset, when you plug your iPhone in, iTunes will say - want to restore from backup?
01:47  Angostura: Check in iTunes > Preferences > Devices to see what backups you have
01:48  John____: I see my iphone backup there
01:48  John____: let me keep on looking for what options i got
01:48  Angostura: You should be fine then.
01:49  Angostura: Good luck, I have to go to bed
01:49  John____: k
01:49  John____: looks like the only option is to delete the backup
01:50  Angostura: NNNNOOOOO
01:50  John____: the only option i got from ehre*
01:50  John____: not that im doing it
01:50  Angostura: Don't delete the backup
01:50  Angostura: Oh.
01:50  Angostura: Good
01:50  Angostura: phew
01:50  John____: but does this backup have my saved game? and my iphone settings and such?
01:53  Angostura: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766
01:54  joako: Does anyone know an alternative to iPhoto to get my photos out of iPhone?
01:56  S_SubZero: I always use the Image Capture thing.
01:56  Angostura: Image Capture
01:57  Angostura: oops - he beat me
01:58  joako: Nevermind I forgot I can run netatalk on the iPhone -- I think that's the best solution
01:59  remyo: Dropbox :) 
02:00  joako: Netatalk! :) http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/3452/screenshot20101018at759.png
02:02  John____: DROPBOX FTW
02:02  John____: I used image capture too, but discovered dropbox, shits cash
02:03  John____: hahahaha
02:04  Bensawsome: John____ hell ya
02:04  Bensawsome: dropbox rocks
02:04  Bensawsome: if i was willing to pay i'd get the 50gb plan to sync my music across computers
02:05  cruzito: 987456320
02:06  John____: Im totally fine with the free 2gb of storage that comes with it. all I'll be using it for is to upload pictures or videos that I have taken with my camera on the iphone
02:06  John____: 2GB is more than enough.
02:07  Bensawsome: i got 4.75 :3
02:07  Bensawsome: bonus space ftw
02:07  Bensawsome: what 'id like is the ability to create your own dropbox server
02:07  Bensawsome: but then that would take away there revenue
02:08  Marvolo: and if you made a dropbox-esque server using some open source software?
02:08  remyo: Bensawsome: http://lifehacker.com/5657283/how-to-make-your-own-open-source-dropbox+like-sync-and-backup-service
02:09  Bensawsome: o.o
02:09  remyo: Actually, thats the proper link, http://fak3r.com/2009/09/14/howto-build-your-own-open-source-dropbox-clone/
02:10  Bensawsome: kewl
02:11  Branes: I don't see the point of running your own dropbox clone
02:12  ChrisAM: Internal, private, corporate usage
02:12  remyo: I just thought Bensawsome might find it interesting. As he said "what 'id like is the ability to create your own dropbox server"
02:12  Bensawsome: ya
02:12  FriedBob: Branes: Oi oi!
02:12  Bensawsome: Branes frankly i dont feel comfortable with sharing some files on dropbox
02:13  Bensawsome: privacy/security
02:13  remyo: I knew this guy who shared his contact info on Dropbox once. BOOM! A week later... Evil clone. 
02:13  ChrisAM: I'm keeping an eye on OpenStack... that project has a lot of potential.
02:13  Bensawsome: lol
02:14  John____: nerd alert
02:14  John____: lol i'll just use dropbox 
02:14  remyo: Bensawsome: Good luck, have fun :D
02:14  John____: dropbox is cloud
02:17  FriedBob: Define "cloud" ?
02:17  John____: wait a minute, blah
02:17  remyo: The best Final Fantasy main character 
02:17  John____: hahaha
02:18  Branes: In Australia, it is a mythical creature rumoured to float around in the sky and drop water on people
02:18  John____: I just uploaded a picture i took form iphone to dropbox. and the picture is rather small
02:18  Bensawsome: ty remyo 
02:18  remyo: No problem 
02:19  John____: isnt iphone 4 camera 5 megapixels? pictures are supposed to come out a lot bigger
02:20  John____: aaah
02:20  remyo: John____: By default dropbox resizes really big images. Theres a way to turn it off though
02:21  remyo: I'll look at my account and see what I changed in a sec
02:22  John____: oh ok
02:26  John____: I dont see anything on my account settings =/
02:27  remyo: Yeah. It wasn't in an obvious place. Trying to remember
02:30 * ChrisAM rsyncs.
02:31  John____: hmm
02:32  John____: I dont like dropbox resizing my pictures
02:32  John____: that just makes me want to use image capture on my macbook pro instead =/
02:32  ChrisAM: Does Flickr have an iOS app?
02:32  ChrisAM: they have one for BlackBerry.
02:34  remyo: John____: Sorry. I can't remember what I did :(
02:34  remyo: But it is possible to turn off resizing 
02:37  John____: I checked on my iPhone dropbox app settings, I got the upload quality all to max, and for videos in HD
02:37  John____: I dont know what else is there
02:39  remyo: John____: When you view the file on your mac where are you looking at it? On the web or directly in the dropbox?
02:40  luist: hello... how can i read google chrome cache on mac?
02:40  John____: well right now im on my windows tower and im using the web dropbox
02:41  remyo: John____: Try looking at it in the dropbox folder
02:41  remyo: It might just be the preview that its resizing
02:42  John____: oops i deleted hte picture
02:42  John____: but I have even downloaded it to my computer, it still showed resized
02:42  John____: it looks like it was resized when uploaded
02:43  remyo: luist: Chrome keeps cache files in ~/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/yourprofile/Cache
02:43  luist: remyo: i know but they are all binary files
02:44  remyo: luist: Uh huh? And what were you hoping for?
02:45  luist: remyo: i want to see the content as i see in the web pages... not in non extension binary files called f_xxxxxx
02:45  luist: remyo: like html jpg css and such
02:45  luist: remyo: something like cacheviewer plugin for firefox
02:46  Tu13es: hm, when restoring from a TM backup can you select what files/folders to restore?
02:46  js_: yes
02:47  js_: (you probably mean something advanced)
02:49  John____: WOW
02:49  remyo: John____: Whats up?
02:49  John____: I cant reset my iPhone to get rid of the restrictions passcode because guess what, I need the passcode in order to reset it! 
02:49  John____: ridiculous.
02:51  remyo: luist: So far as I know it only stores those binary files
02:52  remyo: luist: On OS X anyway. The only other place they'd be is /tmp and it doesn't look like they're there
02:52  luist: remyo: ya but prob i can extract them
02:53  remyo: Might be worth asking #chromium-support 
02:59  joako: So I've spent at least the past hour to get images from my "camera" etc to list something on ebay... this used to take 15 minutes max on Windows
03:00  joako: IS THERE ANY FUCKIUNG COMPUTER I CAN USE WITHOUT A HASSLE???!!!
03:01  ChrisAM: You're doomed.
03:01  S_SubZero: huh
03:02  joako: Yes 2nd time firefox freezes in the same place
03:03  S_SubZero: I never had any issues using Image Capture to get stuff off my iPhone.
03:03  remyo: joekv: 
03:03  remyo: joako: So use windows 
03:04  joako: Oh wow I see image capture actually lets you delete photos without importing them, but importing the photo is the last of my concerns
03:04  joako: going to restart and hope this thing runs more stable'
03:10  joako: And the problem with Windows is microsoft treats its users like idots so even if I run as administrator it won't allow me full control of the system -- at least MacOS and Linux do that.
03:12  S_SubZero: ok
03:23  John____: joako use internet explorer?
03:30  joako: John____, I try to avoid it
03:31  John____: i use internet explorer sometimes when i have even problems getting into facebook when using firefox, most of the time internet explorer works
03:33  joako: Is there even a Mac IE updated less than 5 years ago?
03:34  joako: I could have sworn the last version was for OS 9
03:34  John____: what? no lol
03:34  John____: use safari if you're on a mac
03:34  S_SubZero: I use Chrome
03:35  diffract|: i'm trying to uninstall xcode but when i run the install script it says "Can't determine system version." what should i do?
03:36  John____: I mainly use firefox for both windows and mac, but when I have problems going in a site i'll use the default browser, and it mostly works from there.
03:36  ChrisAM: I've never tried to uninstall xcode... can't you just drag /Developer to the trash?
03:38  diffract|: i don't think it's that easy
03:38  diffract|: they have an uninstall script and they instruct you to do that in the instructions pdf
03:40  fleebailey33: diffract|: its a mac
03:40  fleebailey33: it probably is just about that eay
03:41  FriedBob: fleebailey33: Prolly not for Xcode.
03:41  fleebailey33: yea..
03:41  fleebailey33: it installs kexts too
03:41  fleebailey33: like CHUD
03:42 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
03:45  MultiFinder: joako: The last version of MSIE for the Mac was 5.2.3 for Mac OS X.
03:45  fleebailey33: MultiFinder: it works on SL too
03:46  John____: Fenix? as in, the dragoon Fenix from Starcraft?
03:46  MultiFinder: Yup, I run it from time to time when I decide I hate myself :P
03:46  remyo: fleebailey33: Seriously? 
03:46  fleebailey33: yes
03:46  fleebailey33: i copied the .app from 10.3
03:48  MultiFinder: remyo: http://i52.tinypic.com/amciuc.png
03:48  remyo: Jeepers creepers
03:49  MultiFinder: Quite so :P
03:49  Tomis: wow, i'm surprised it even runs MultiFinder 
03:50  John____: looool@ the old internet explorer for mac os 9
03:50  MultiFinder: Ah, the magic of Rosetta.
03:50  ChrisAM: anyone using the latest Skype on 10.6.4?
03:50  John____: havent seen that in ages, I still got my old mac g3 tower here with that thing
03:50  Tomis: oh yea, it was PPC too
03:50 +Berzerker: IE Mac?
03:50  remyo: ChrisAM: I am
03:50 +Berzerker: lol
03:50  Tomis: i ran it the other day ChrisAM 
03:50  ChrisAM: I reloaded my system last night, and reinstalled Skype... when I try to connect, it just sits there and spins
03:50  Tomis: ran fine
03:50  MultiFinder: Running it right now, seems to be going just peachily.
03:51  ChrisAM: it worked fine yesterday before the reload
03:51  ChrisAM: keystr0k came in here yesterday with the same problem.
03:51  remyo: ChrisAM: Maybe remove your skype application support folder?
03:51  ChrisAM: weird... there it finally went
03:51  diffract|: the uninstall script doesn't check whether the system is 10.6 or not.. it just says if version==1.4 or 1.5
03:52  ChrisAM: I let it sit for a good 3-4 minutes
04:05  joako: MultiFinder: Yes LOL that goes great with a Bondi PowerMac
04:13  John____: i dont want to restore my iPhone
04:14  John____: I got nothing restricted, I got restrictions on but no apps are restricted so its not worth doing a factory reset to just be able to get in restrictions
04:14  John____: right? someone humor me
04:14  John____: I dont want to restore my iPhone
04:14  Tomis: what' the problem?
04:18  John____: I've given my friends my iphone for them to see and I dont know someone must have put restrictions on my iphone because I never put a passcode for restrictions
04:18  Tomis: parental controls?
04:19  John____: and I've read the only way to remove the passcode is to do a reset. I dont have anything restricted on my iPhone though, its just I cant get inside the settings youknow what I mean?
04:19  John____: I need an iphone user to know what I'm talking about -_-
04:19  Tomis: ask you friends what the password is
04:19  John____: yeah I think it was something liek that
04:19  Tomis: or restore the iphone from the backup
04:19  John____: it was not really my friends, my friend passed the iphone to his family to see, and his little cousins and such
04:20  John____: ok whats the restore procedure then?
04:20  Tomis: google iphone restore backup
04:20  John____: I first restore the iphone (which will absolutely delete everything on it) and what next?
04:20  Tomis: first hit should be apple's instructions
04:22  John____: ok, found the page wit the instructions
04:25  joako: But once you restore the iPhone it will revert to the old restrictions settings
04:25  Tomis: hence restoring from backups he made previously joako 
04:25  joako: Also be VERY CAREFUL with iTunes backup -- it will only keep the LAST backup of your phone, so if you wipe and tell it "setup as new phone" right then it deltes the old backups
04:27  John____: thats lame
04:27  John____: lolwut?
04:27  John____: oh ok, yeah
04:28  John____: so it'll restore from the latest backup itunes has made of the iphone
04:28  John____: thats what I would like anyway
04:28  John____: but if it still keeps the old restictions passcode, I guess thats ok. It'll reset the failed attempts I have done to it (which are 11 times so far, each time asks me to try again for 60 minutes)
04:29  joako: Go to iTunes Preferences and devices it will tell you the time of the last backup... if you have a backup before the password was set, that should work
04:29  John____: I dont know if i can go any longer. if I do make amy more failed attempts the iphone may blow up
04:32  joako: Have you gotten around to jailbreaking your phone yet?
04:33  joako: it seems in /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist is the unlock password
04:33  joako: I just enabled restrictions on mine and set the pin to 1111 and I see in that file: 	<key>SBParentalControlsPIN</key>
04:33  joako: 	<string>1111</string>
04:34  John____: no, I refuse to jailbreak it.
04:34  John____: and i know how to do it, its so simple.
04:34  John____: but II'm not doing it.
04:34  joako: Ok.... you might be able to extract that from your backup, but there is your answer
04:36  John____: huh?
04:36  joako: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=4974
04:36  joako: If you uncompress the iPhone backup on your computer you should be able to access the com.apple.springboard.plist file and get the passcode
04:37  John____: wow
04:37  John____: thats amazing
04:38  John____: how do I do this
04:38  joako: If you were to jailbreak the phone you could just open Mobile Terminal and read the file :)
04:38  John____: sorry i'll read the page, im just busy with college work at the same time
04:38  joako: I posted a link above with the info...
04:39  John____: why would i need to jailbreak this to do this
04:42  joako: Not to do that, only if you want to bypass that process and access the file directly on the phone itself... e.g. I just opened my finder and "joako's iPhone" shows up in the network places list
04:51  John____: well I would definitely would like to do that procedure a lot better than doing a poinlless full restore to my iphone
04:51  John____: then you know what i might consider jailbreaking it just for htis
05:14  Macannoy: macs are great but why dont they provide updates for them that just sux big time. 
05:15  Macannoy: i cant get things i need for my os it is brass me off 
05:15  Macannoy: any ideas y 
05:16  CPng|N: huh?
05:16  CPng|N: that kind of things do you think you need that they are not providing?
05:16  Macannoy: well i cant get updates 
05:22  Macannoy: a version of chrome for one. and general security updates that my other mac tht hqs the latest os can get 
05:22  aaron42: hey, is this a good place to ask questions about bootcamp windows?
05:22  aaron42: or is there a dedicated channel for that?
05:23  Macannoy: aaron42: read the topic. this is a mac channel no windss suppoet here try #windows 
05:23  aaron42: it's specific to bootcamp
05:23  aaron42: hardware issues
05:23  Macannoy: then ask away 
05:23  aaron42: my air overheats under windows and i can't find any fan control stuff that works
05:24  aaron42: i've tried the standard mac-side fan control stuff but it does nothing
05:24  aaron42: lubbo's fan control doesn't start
05:24  aaron42: and the other one doesn't recognize my fans
05:24  aaron42: any ideas?
05:24  aaron42: it's bad enough that i get spontaneous shutdowns that i'm pretty sure are from overheat
05:25  Macannoy: aaron42: windows os will do that has probles. get a cooling pad and also try cpu frequency scalling tool 
05:26  aaron42: sigh
05:26  aaron42: thanks
05:35  CPng|N: smcfancontrol?
05:55  Marvolo: Does anybody have an opinion on CoolBookController, for aaron42?
06:01 --- n00p is now known as n69p
06:13  aaron42: i can't even get the fan speed to change under os x
06:13  aaron42: i've tried smcfancontrol
06:13  aaron42: and i can see the minspeed set to 6200
06:13  aaron42: in both the gui and console tool
06:14  aaron42: but the actual speed isn't going up
06:14  aaron42: i'm starting to think i have a hardware problem and should pay a visit to the genius bar
06:15  aaron42: it runs noticeably cooler under os x than under windows tho, so it's not entirely hardware....
06:16  FriedBob: aaron42: Are you running Windows baremetal or via bootcamp?
06:21  John____: paralllels rules
06:25  FriedBob: Wouldn't know. My mac can't run it.
06:27  FriedBob: I need to go to bed. I actually have to get up and go to work for a change.
06:35  nitay: is there a way to rewrite all of mac's command key shortcuts to use ctrl? note i am not asking to change ctrl key to command key, i know how to do that... but that does not do what i want
06:35  Tomis: no nitay 
06:36  Tomis: control is a sepperate modifier
06:36  nitay: hmm ok, i have a keyboard with only two keys, i was hoping i could just use ctrl/alt
06:36  Tomis: set control to be command then
06:37  nitay: so then it sends both?
06:37  Tomis: no
06:37  Tomis: then it would have no control key
06:37  Tomis: so your keyboard has no windows key?
06:37  nitay: basically right
06:37  nitay: its a goldtouch mac keyboard
06:37  Tomis: huh?
06:37  nitay: it does have it, but its far away
06:38  Tomis: if it's a mac keyboard, then it has a command key
06:38  Tomis: so what's the problem
06:38  nitay: http://www.goldtouch.com/p-63-goldtouch-for-mac-adjustable-keyboard-putty.aspx
06:38  nitay: problem is just that i really only have two keys close by
06:38  nitay: the other two are farther away than it might seem in that picture
06:39  nitay: really i'd like outside (corner) key to be ctrl
06:39  nitay: and inside key to be alt and command sorta thing?
06:39  Tomis: um, that's what they are already
06:39  nitay: no im saying be both
06:39  nitay: right now outside key is option (alt)
06:39  nitay: inside key is command
06:39  nitay: ctrl is way far away
06:40  Tomis: yea, take a look in system prefs>keyboard>modifier keys
06:40  Tomis: you can switch them around
06:40  nitay: ok but it still doesnt do what i want
06:40  nitay: here's what i really need
06:41  nitay: the mac keys are fine everywhere but with one program : terminal
06:41  nitay: but i use terminal all the time
06:41  nitay: and for it command is basically useless
06:41  Tomis: yea, just deal with it, afaik there isn't anything to swap the modifer keys around per-app
06:41  nitay: damn
06:41  Tomis: or get a keyboard that doesn't have such an insane layout
06:41  nitay: heh
06:42  nitay: ye it is a messed up layout, i just love the keyboard itself so much cause it's all split and comfortable
06:42  nitay: can't have my cake and eat it too i guess
06:42  Tomis: i'm sure you can find an ergonomic one that was designed in such a wacky fashion
06:43  Tomis: you could also try a search of macupdate.com or iusethis.com for 3rd party software to swap the modifers around
06:43  nitay: k, thx
06:43  Tomis: or look at an alternate terminal app, or look through terminal's prefs
06:44  Tomis: might be a setting to use command as control within the app, who knows
06:44  John____: hello
06:45  John____: is joako here?
06:59  joako: Yes
07:04  PascalHunger: anyone here have the 2008 white macbook?
07:04  PascalHunger: how much different is it then the late 09?
07:04  PascalHunger: is the screen on the 08 one bad? or just not as good as the late 09 one?
07:04  John____: joako
07:05  John____: whats the procedure to that iclarified page
07:05  John____: to remove the passcode from the restrictions on the iphone
07:07  joako: Use that program to find /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.springboard.plist and if you open that file with a text editor you will see <key>SBParentalControlsPIN</key> <string>1111</string> where 1111 is the "restrictions" passcode
07:09  joako: Anyone can recommend a good IM client? I am using pidgin and it won't work with the ??t?rn?ti?al keyboard... also the menus aren't mac style
07:19  tos9: joako: colloquy is buggy as hell, linkinus isn't free, xchat is outdated. Honestly, I'd go with irssi, or find the one out of the 3 of those whose blemish is least damnig
07:20  tos9: *damning
07:25  joako: Oh I just meant IM client, not IRC... but xchat again fails to deliver 1 feature I use
07:26  PascalHunger: anyone about my macbook question?
07:29  danl: PascalHunger: compare them here: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/index-macbook.html
07:30  torchie: I started out on xchat
07:30  torchie: been on colloquy now
07:31  danl: I use irssi
07:31 * jeremyw too
07:31  danl: got tired of having to compile my own colloquy with my bug fixes included because they would wait 2 months and want me to give them another diff file so they could apply my patch to the new code
07:32  torchie: went to irssi a few times
07:32  torchie: not enough graffix
07:32  jeremyw: Graphics don't make an app...usability does.
07:32  jeremyw: irssi has that in spades.
07:32  danl: it's irc... why does it need graphics?
07:32  jeremyw: But your response reminds me you are a Mac user...if it isn't shiny, it sucks.
07:33  danl: jeremyw: lol
07:33  tos9: joako: sorry, misread, been a long day. Honestly, I use iChat whenever I (extremely rarely) need IM
07:33  danl: I prefer adium for IM
07:33  PascalHunger: danl: i was sorta wanting to know opinions hehe 
07:34  tos9: Adium's probably better, it looks it. I just don't use it often enough to justify using something else
07:34  robgleeson: irssi isn't even that usable if you're in a lot of networks, and a lot of channels. I don't want to bind keys other than 0-9 for changing channels ;)
07:34  danl: PascalHunger: ah, I have an 07 black macbook, so I'm the wrong person to ask
07:34  PascalHunger: danl: same screen
07:34  PascalHunger: how is the screen?
07:34  jeremyw: robgleeson: I'm in over 14 and it seems to do fine...4 different servers.
07:34  danl: robgleeson: they are setup by default to roll to q-p for 11-20
07:34  PascalHunger: in 09 the regular macbook went to a led backlit one etc etc
07:34  jeremyw: danl++
07:35  jeremyw: You got it.
07:35  jeremyw: Of course, p is for page up for me.
07:35  robgleeson: danl: yup, I don't wan to use those keys, and I don't want to use /buffer either(coming from weechat, actually, but same stuff applies to irssi)
07:35  robgleeson: if i was in 10 channels, I'd use irssi or weechat.
07:35  danl: this movie is weird....
07:35  robgleeson: want*
07:36  jeremyw: Do any of you use VCS like git, mercurial or subversion?
07:36  robgleeson: I use git.
07:36  danl: I'ma git fan
07:36  danl: hell I git all my .conf files and share them across my nix systems
07:36  jeremyw: What would you think of a web-based management console that is VCS agnostic, providing a common UI and features for whatever VCS you, or your company, uses?
07:37  robgleeson: I don't know because I'm quite happy with Git + GIthub :)
07:37  jeremyw: So you, or your company, could deploy whatever VCSes they wanted and manage all of it form a nice UI?
07:37  danl: sounds nifty, but being agnositc, it may obscure some of the best features of the individual VCS's
07:39  jeremyw: robgleeson: Yeah...but if you were to host your own servers, you wouldn't have GitHub unless you wanted to pay.
07:39  jeremyw: danl: Nah...you'd have to see it to believe it.
07:39  robgleeson: I host my own private git repositories too, on my own server.
07:39  jeremyw: danl: I see your concern though.
07:39  jeremyw: robgleeson: Yeah...for DIY it's easy to get up I guess.
07:39  tos9: As do I. Plus, now that bitbucket has unlimited privates, it's tempting as hell
07:39  danl: If I stop responding, it's because I am trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this movie
07:39  jeremyw: Maybe my app is only useful for the enterprise then, not that it has to be.
07:39  jeremyw: Hm...
07:39  danl: dude is wondering around in the dark covered in mud
07:40  jeremyw: Reduces your heat signature...
07:40  danl: not predator ;)
07:40  jeremyw: Basically, I've developed a VCS agnostic GitHub/BitBucket/etc.
07:40  jeremyw: It's not complete, so there are features not completed, but it works.
07:40  danl: jeremyw: sounds nice, as long as it allows the user to delve into the advanced features of each one if need be,
07:41  jeremyw: The repository browser is stupid fast, without a database-based cache or anything.
07:41  danl: stupid fast on what scale of testing? (how much resources does it use and will it scale well?)
07:41  jeremyw: danl: For sure.  Hook management is a feature that might be useful, like selecting a hook out of a pool (like commit emails) or writing your own.
07:42  jeremyw: danl: Well, stupid fast on big projects like Git's repository, Subversion's repository, Mercurial's repository and Bazaar's repository.
07:42  jeremyw: So each VCS impl was tested on the sources of the VCS it enables.
07:42  danl: (I don't mean to be poking looking for holes, just things that pop into my head as a software dev ;) )
07:42  jeremyw: Of course, I'd like to have some database-based "cache" of commit information.
07:43  danl: yea, because once you get a large amount of users, the processor overhead of not having a cache will drop the system to it's knees
07:43  jeremyw: Yeah...I've been pretty quiet about the idea myself so I don't mind you asking questions or poking holes.
07:43  jeremyw: danl: For sure...but to see how it runs in worst case, and to just get shit working in the first place, you have to start somewhere.
07:44  danl: true
07:44  danl: okay... wtf...
07:44  jeremyw: heat...signature...
07:44 * jeremyw laughs
07:48  danl: So far, it's like Pi meets Predator mixed in with Momento, City of Embers and Cube stirred in

08:45  AngryAnt: That is indeed my fear. Only I wanted to see if there were any known issues and I haven't dropped it or anything since my last successful call yesterday evening.
08:46  LSD`: AngryAnt: I get similar symptoms here, too. It called being in a poor signal area. What's making it worse is iOS 4.0.1 and higher rejig the way the bars are displayed so you find yourself being confronted with the reality that your signal conditions aren't as good as you thought they were
08:47  AngryAnt: How would that explain the failing calls?
08:47  AngryAnt: Also I have not upgraded since my last call

09:12  spaceninja: hi, I tried to update an old powermac G4, but the installation failed at the end of the installation. Right now the whole system is buggy, the dock doesn's work, switching windows with apple + tab doesn't work, and finder doesn't list the shortcut dirs. What should I do?
09:12  Isenn: Anyone know where in Entourage 2007 the "nick-names" are saved? in outlook the file is called .nk2. Anyonw know where entourage saves its?
09:12  Isenn: in to from field
09:12  danl: spaceninja: might want to reinstall, or you could try a perm repair and then a combo update
09:13  danl: Isenn: no idea
09:13  spaceninja: danl: reinstall the whole os?
09:13  danl: spaceninja: might be necessary
09:13  spaceninja: hm, but I don't have any cd's, I found the mac in my friends basement
09:14  danl: ah
09:14  danl: try installing a combo update
09:14  danl: even if you are fully upgraded
09:15  spaceninja: what's  a combo update?
09:15  danl: What version of OS X is on there?
09:15  spaceninja: 10.4.11 
09:16  LSD`: If you have another PowerPC Mac handy, try running the update from that to the other one while it's in target disk mode
09:16  danl: http://support.apple.com/downloads/Mac_OS_X_10_4_11_Combo_Update__PPC_
09:17  spaceninja: ok thx, hmm, the buttons don't work, 
09:17  LSD`: spaceninja: A combo update contains all the fixes and updates from the previous releases in a single file whereas a Delta update only contains the changes from the one immediately before it. In other words, you can go from 10.4.0 to 10.4.11 with a single combo update, but delta updates would require installing 11 seperate ones in sequence
09:18  danl: what LSD` said is a good explination... combo updates can also fix broken things on the system, sometimes
09:18  spaceninja: ok, sounds good
10:35 --- fargiola1 is now known as fargiolas
10:51  anomaly: I just inherited a dual 450 powermac g4.  It looks like mac does not support software too long.. as in, I have an xp machine that is ten years old happily running itunes 10 and netflix.  yet, after the latest tiger update.. it still does not get the latest safari or itunes to let me really do something with it.  any ideas?
10:55  LSD`: I highly doubt your 10 year old machine is running any of that "happily", but anyway, the dual 450 is probably running Panther or Tiger, while iTunes 10 seeming needs Leopard as a minimum. Whichever way you look at it, it's not a bad software support run
10:59  anomaly: LSD` I appreciate the input, but to clarify, I was curious why I could not update to the latest versions of said software.  sure, it may not be as fast to load as something newer, yet I am confused why apple would not let me just install it anyway
11:00  anomaly: not to compare, but as it is all I know, I can run latest firefox to view netflix as I said, on the xp machine.  whereas, so far, I am not seeing the option to even download safari past a certain version
11:01  LSD`: A couple of reasons that I can think of. First, they want people to buy new machines with newer OS versions on them and secondly, they may be using features that are only supported in Leopard or newer
11:01  anomaly: I see.. perhaps I will just install bsd on it then and turn it into a server.  thanks again.
11:02  LSD`: Also, the only reason XP has stayed supported for this long is because of people's reluctance to move to Vista. Now that 7's here, XP support will start tapering off.
11:10  Angostura: You didn't keep his attention LSD` :-)
11:16  danl: The main reason iTunes 10 and Safari 5 require 10.5 or higher is because of the use of new cocoa frameworks not available to 10.4...
11:17  LSD`: I had a feeling it was something like that, but getting people to buy newer machines is in their interests too
11:18  danl: LSD`: and the real main reason for XP is corporation don't want to spend the massive amounts of money when xp still works and is still supported
11:18  danl: that and it breaks half of there intranet sites because they would be forced to leave ie6
11:19  LSD`: XP was only "still supported" because MS extended the lifecycle in response to lukewarm uptake of Vista
11:20  danl: which was partly due to the ie6 issue in professional settings
11:20  Angostura: Yay for ActiveX!
11:21  danl: trying to get corp america to let go for ie6 is like prying a bottle of whiskey out of the hands of an alcoholic... they don't know that it's better for them to give it up
11:22  LSD`: danl: ...but mostly due to normal people sticking with XP on their regular machines. MS could have dealt with the corporates, that's what the whole tail end of their support lifecycle is about.
11:23  danl: I have to deal with the people who don't want to give up 10.4.11 almost daily... pain in my ass
11:24 * danl warns self about language because he forgot where he was
11:25  LSD`: The fact that MS let XP be sold and supported during Vista shows that they learned a lesson from the whole ME mess
11:25  danl: ME?
11:27  danl: That must be that version before XP and after 98 that I completely blocked out of my memory and refuse to recall
11:28  LSD`: It's the version MS released as a stopgap because 2000 was in no way able to be a consumer desktop OS :P
11:29  danl: Do you know how much fun it was to get NT, 98, ME, and XP to play nicely on a network together?
11:31  LSD`: Probably more fun than it was to get Linux working in a similar environment XD

18:27  sig: thinking I want the new iWeb but if a new version is going to come out soon I should just wait
18:27  vis: hi there. are there any free utilities which I can use to compare a huge backup folder with another folder, to identify duplicate files, so I can erase the backups which I already have?
18:30  alexbobP: for future backups, if you copy your backup directory with "cp -val", it will make hardlinks to every file so that duplicates won't take up extra hard drive space
18:30  alexbobP: but for now you'll need a duplicate file finder, dunno any for mac os x, but google can find some I'm sure
18:30  vis: google's coming up with a few; I'm just struggling to find freeware
18:30  vis: if it comes down to it I might have to hit the command line
18:31  sig: carbonite?
18:31  alexbobP: the command line is really the best way to do backups
18:31  alexbobP: you can update a backup directory with rsync to be the same as your hard drive
18:31  alexbobP: and then use cp -val to copy old backups without taking up extra hard drive space
18:31  alexbobP: fully incremental backups with only basic tools
18:32  vis: these are some quite old files on another laptop; somehow I ended up with dupes. Problem is I've reorganised the file structure on the mac so it's a pain seeing which i already have.
18:32  alexbobP: oh, I see... if you've re-located the files then my method wouldn't help anyways :P

20:06  Marvolo:  Any chance of playing a 1080p m2ts movie on an integrated graphics card?
20:10  CPng|N: maybe. depends on hold old it is really
20:11  zer0her0: ouch mpeg2 1080p
20:11  Tomis: that's a lot of bandwidth
20:12  Tomis: only one way to find out Marvolo , try it
20:12  Marvolo: Yah it doesn't work
20:12  zer0her0: though gfx cards must have logic for mpeg2 to still in there right?
20:12  zer0her0: Marvolo: haha
20:13  Marvolo: the audio is outstanding though
20:13  zer0her0: "hey could this work?" "yea possibly" "well it doesn't"
20:13  Marvolo: it was in the processing of downloading when i asked
20:13  Marvolo: i didn't notice it was that format until just now
20:13  zer0her0: isn't m2ts a streaming format?
20:14  ritsuka: nope, is the format used in bluray
20:14  ritsuka: and often it contains h.264, so even slower to decode than mpeg-2
20:15  Tomis: shouldn' it be faster to decode
20:15  Tomis: since mpeg4/h264 are hardware accelerated now
20:15  Tomis: and it requires less bandwidth then mpeg2
20:15  ritsuka: only in QuickTime X, maybe plex
20:15  Tomis: oh good point
20:16  Tomis: VLC doesn't have any hardware decoding does it
20:25  crilly: mmeeehhh
20:37  zer0her0: *sigh* google fail
20:37  zer0her0: iPod != iPad
20:38  alexbobP: what does that have to do with google
20:39  zer0her0: i googled iPad backplate, and it gives me results for iPod backplate
20:40  S_SubZero: it does the "did you mean' thing but still shows ipad backplate results.
20:41  Tomis: what happened to your ipad?
20:41  zer0her0: was dumb and just droped it and bent the case, ussually i don't care but it's right near the power button
20:42  Tomis: damn
20:42  crilly: eeek
20:42  Tomis: well there will be a new generation next year and this model will be obsolete by then
20:43  zer0her0: Tomis: haha
20:43  crilly: I'm waiting until next year before getting one
20:43  crilly: They will have to make it lighter, slightly smaller and have a retina display. I'll consider one then.
20:44  zer0her0: seriously a retina display means they would have to pack what a 23" display into 10"
20:44  zer0her0: lighter yes, and smaller for day to day use i'd love for it to be smaller
20:44  crilly: Well the rumours are they're releasing a 7" version of the iPad.
20:44  crilly: But you know rumours.
20:44  zer0her0: yea
20:45  torchie: yeah I'm a bit confused about
20:45  zer0her0: ?
20:46  torchie: apple comes out with a 3.5" phone and everyone competes with 4" phones
20:46  torchie: apple comes out with a 10" tablet and everyone competes with 7" tablets
20:47  crilly: That's because everyone else is an idiot.
20:47  torchie: making a tablet screen 3 inches smaller diagonally isn't gonna make it fit in your jean pocket any better
20:47  zer0her0: 7" is almost pocketable
20:47  zer0her0: it fits in my coat pocket and my cargo pants, and some back pockets, there's not a single pocket the iPad fits in
20:48  crilly: It would fit in a clown's pocket.
20:48  crilly: Or a wizard's sleeve.
20:48  torchie: playbook's battery seems pretty sweet though
20:49  torchie: what are the specs on the ipad's battery
20:49  zer0her0: 10 or so hours
20:49  b3ny0-: everyone else is an idiot?
20:49  torchie: hmm
20:49  zer0her0: i find i use it for notes, reading ebooks, and other research and by the end of my 14 hour day i can still watch netflix before it dies
20:50  torchie: blackberries apparently last for a billion years
20:50  b3ny0-: apple really didn't invent any of these products, they just made them more marketable
20:50  zer0her0: yea
20:50  torchie: they didn't just make them marketable
20:50  torchie: they made them plausible
20:50  luist: hey how can i remove macports and everything installed by it on my mac? can i delete /opt/share/var/macports, /opt/share/etc/macports, /opt/share/share/macports ?
20:50  crilly: b3ny0-: It was a joke, calm down
20:51  b3ny0-: I'm perfectly calm dude ;)
20:51  torchie: there's doing it for the sake of doing it and then there's doing it the way it's gotta be done
20:51  b3ny0-: that said, they've paved the way for lots of interesting uses for these things people never thought of
20:52  crilly: Absolutely.
20:53  b3ny0-: ipad will probably put Jazzmutant out of business soon
20:53  torchie: well
20:53  Tomis: put who out of business?
20:54  torchie: jazzmutant's probably got better audio hardware in it
20:54  b3ny0-: it doesn't hae any audio hardware in it
20:54  b3ny0-: its just a controller
20:54  torchie: oh
20:54  torchie: then i dunno
20:54  b3ny0-: and ipad can do everything it does
20:54  b3ny0-: plus a lot more
20:54  b3ny0-: for 1/3 of the price :)
20:54  torchie: :o
20:56  alexbobP: well there are a lot of companies that make stupid touchscreen devices that you'd think tablet pcs would have put out of business
20:56  alexbobP: like the wallmounted touchscreen that every home security rig has a few of
20:56  alexbobP: those things cost thousands, so it's weird to me that people aren't just slapping linux on a tablet notebook and putting that on the wall...
20:56  b3ny0-: those aren't really multitouch
20:57  Tomis: they are, it's called android alexbobP 
20:57  alexbobP: oh good point
20:57  alexbobP: Tomis: they are what?
20:57  alexbobP: Tomis: I wasn't aware of android-powered home security control panels
20:58  Tomis: they're slapping linux on those things and calling it a day
20:58  alexbobP: b3ny0-: anyways you get my point... those things aren't multitouch, and they sell for more than an ipad or tablet
20:58  alexbobP: b3ny0-: they could easily be replaced

21:23  kennyG: Man! Can't wait...
21:23  kennyG: Will it be great?
21:23  kennyG: :)\
21:23  zer0her0: it will be a let down
21:23  kennyG: yeah!!!
21:23  kennyG: :D
21:24  crilly: http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2010/10/the-21st-century-guide-to-platform-trolling-apple-edition.ars/
21:24  kennyG: I think this night I will pass asleep.
21:24  crilly: Good article. I think Apple need to read this and wake up a bit.
21:26  kennyG: The thing is Apple develops the best tecnology/products. Unfortunatly they must lead. And there is thousand of idiots/imitators following it.
21:27  zer0her0: apple doesn't develop the best technology, they just know how to market existin technology and make solidly designed products that look nice.
21:27  kennyG: Google should keep on searching business. They are trying to hack the masket copying mature comapnies market. Come on!
21:28  zer0her0: kennyG: ummm huh?
21:28  kennyG: I mean they keep copying Apple product ideas.
21:29 * zer0her0 blinks
21:29  kennyG: First was iPhone.
21:29  kennyG: Now the iTablet.
21:29  kennyG: Why they don't create nothing original?
21:29  danl: kennyG: pretty sure tehre was an android tablet on the market first
21:30  zer0her0: kennyG: you do know there cell phones before apple? and in addition there were smartphones before the iPhone right?
21:30  S_SubZero: danl: the difference is, nobody cared about an android tablet.
21:30  danl: S_SubZero: same product from anyone other than apple, and nobody would have cared about it either ;)
21:30  danl: zer0her0: I think I am going to buy: http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/firefly-original-television/id211499971
21:31  zer0her0: nobody cared about it from apple when they did it before
21:31  zer0her0: ;)
21:31  zer0her0: danl: i own it on DVD, tempted to get BR release of it
21:31  kennyG: What is the name of that Apple device with imitates an eletronic agenda?
21:31  S_SubZero: the newton?  
21:31  zer0her0: oh it's the soundtrack
21:31  kennyG: Yes!!!
21:31  kennyG: Newton!
21:31  zer0her0: never listened to it
21:31  danl: zer0her0: I have the BD :)
21:31  danl: That's the soundtrack
21:32  zer0her0: i have the theme, i don't need anything else
21:32  danl: I just bought the theme...
21:32  danl: debating going ahead and getting the rest
21:32  zer0her0: heh
21:32  danl: One of the best theme songs ever
21:33  zer0her0: yep
21:33  kennyG: One could say Newton as the first portable device on earth
21:34  kennyG: s/as/was
21:34  zer0her0: clay tablet FTW
21:34  zer0her0: moses beat Apple to the punch
21:34  danl: zer0her0: yup :)
21:34  torchie: well
21:34  torchie: cheetahs are faster than humans
21:35  danl: actually, not moses but the mesopatamians
21:35  torchie: bears are stronger
21:35  torchie: dolphins are better swimmers
21:35  torchie: but who came out on top?
21:35  danl: eagles see better and rabbits hear better, your point?
21:35  danl: we need to cross breed a bear, rabbit, eagle, dolphin and a cheetah...
21:35  danl: that's what I take fromt hat
21:35  danl: *from that
21:35  zer0her0: danl: make it so
21:36  torchie: yeah but then you just end up with something that humps your leg and screams WHY DID YOU PLAY GOD
21:36  danl: eey capt'n
21:36 * zer0her0 eyes torchie's leg
21:36  torchie: :O
21:36  torchie: WHY
21:36 * danl rolls up newspaper
21:36  zer0her0: that's a mighty fine leg you got there
21:36 * danl points newspaper at zer0her0 
21:36  zer0her0: :(
21:37  b3ny0-: can't wait to try out the filtatron
22:04  cryptic0: Is there a way to start a new instant of terminal without having to go back to the space where the first instant is running?  It's very annoying.
22:05  cryptic0: this is true for many other programs including vim
22:06  crilly: I wish I could sync my iPhone via WiFi or Bluetooth with my MBP.
22:07  zer0her0: mobileme
22:08  crilly: why should I pay when wifi and bt are already in place? just needs the software
22:09  cryptic0: crilly:  you can do that if you jailbroke your phone
22:09  crilly: I don't want break my phone.
22:09  cryptic0: you wouldn't
22:10  cryptic0: jailbreaking has become very safe (as long as you don't accidentally upgrade to an OS version which isn't supported yet)
22:10  webPragmatist: what the crap does it mean when iphoto puts a exclamation mark if you try to view the whole image
22:11  cryptic0: probably unreadable format
22:11  webPragmatist: no
22:11  webPragmatist: it's like gone?
22:11  webPragmatist: wtf
22:11  webPragmatist: iphoto effing fails
22:12  crilly: yeah I dislike iPhoto
22:12  cryptic0: I dont like iPhoto, it keeps its contents separate from my pictures folder.  I would like to keep them synced for a variety of reasons.
22:12  alexbobP: we're allowed to talk about jailbreaking here?  that's a shocker
22:12  webPragmatist: alexbobP: take it to #iphone
22:12  crilly: no you're not.
22:12  cryptic0: alexbobP:  this forum isn't owned by Apple
22:12  alexbobP: webPragmatist: don't tell me
22:12  alexbobP: cryptic0: I know, but hackintosh talk is banned
22:12  alexbobP: cryptic0: so I figured the same draconian rules would extend to other things apple doesn't like
22:13  cryptic0: hackintosh = jailbraking?
22:13  alexbobP: if this forum was actually not owned by apple people could talk about whatever
22:13  crilly: jailbreaking isn't permitted either, really.
22:13  crilly: jailbreaking talk is permitted to a degree.
22:13  crilly: In fact, they're both permitted as long as you don't share or discuss the implementation of them.
22:13  alexbobP: wow
22:14  alexbobP: well I once got banned just for mentioning that I had been running a hackintosh distro
22:14  alexbobP: even though I didn't share any details about how I did it, and I was running it on a real mac
22:14  crilly: because as a community, we're not interested in showing people how to potentially break the law.
22:14  cryptic0: so anyone knows anything about my problem (see above)
22:14  Norrin: where is the iphone dev channel? 
22:14  zer0her0: alexbobP: um were you the one that admitted to DLing a torrent of a hackitosh distro and claimed you were running it on a mac?
22:15  Toastable: norrin: #iphonedev
22:15  cryptic0: crilly:  fyi, jailbraking is perfectly legal
22:15  webPragmatist: i only admit to legal stuff
22:15  webPragmatist: like kiddie porn
22:15  Norrin: Toastable: thanks!
22:15  alexbobP: zer0her0: I don't recall anything about torrenting, but I did say I was running a hackintosh distro on a mac
22:15  crilly: cryptic0: In the US.
22:15  cryptic0: is this forum not hosted in US?
22:15  zer0her0: alexbobP: cause you "lost your discs"
22:15  alexbobP: zer0her0: yeah... although that's not a problem anymore, I've gotten a new one
22:15  zer0her0: alexbobP: yea you said you torrented it
22:15  Norrin: hackintosh distro on a mac? wtf...
22:15  webPragmatist: dudes
22:15  webPragmatist: DUDES
22:16  crilly: cryptic0: No. Freenode is an IRC network that consists of multiple servers from mutliple countries. It can't be pinpointed as being hosted in a single country
22:16  zer0her0: and the fact you did that, makes no sense
22:16  crilly: cryptic0: And this isn't a "forum"
22:16  webPragmatist: can't we all just get along?
22:16  alexbobP: zer0her0: I did it because it was the only os x .iso I had on hand to try to fix my system with
22:16  alexbobP: zer0her0: I also didn't know that hackintosh distros didn't have support for genuine apple hardware
22:17  webPragmatist: this channel is for bitching about all things #mac … there's not much to bitch about considering the iphone is one of the best phones ever created...
22:17  webPragmatist: jailbroken or not
22:17  alexbobP: a non jailbroken iphone is a paperweight
22:17  crilly: In fact, seeing as Jailbreaking is legal in the US, I'm happy for it to be discussed.
22:17  webPragmatist: alexbobP: you obviously live in a world of retarddom
22:17  crilly: I don't speak for the other OPs though ;)
22:18  webPragmatist: besides tethering a base iphone does really nothing more than a jb one
22:18  alexbobP: webPragmatist: and you were obviously homeschooled by pro comedians, because your wit is as sharp as cheddar
22:18  webPragmatist: o gawsh
22:19  webPragmatist: anyway...
22:19  webPragmatist: i've successfully diverted the topic
22:19  crilly: mmm cheese
22:19 * webPragmatist dusts hands
22:20  zer0her0: to further de-rail things: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVkedyQZfwQ
22:20  cryptic0: I have terminal open in space # 1, now I am in space # 4 and I want another instance of terminal there.  If I now clicked on terminal.app, it will take me back to space # 1
22:20  cryptic0: any way to avoid this?
22:20 * alexbobP doesn't know anything about spaces
22:20  zer0her0: not a fan of spaces
22:20  crilly: cryptic0: Might need another Terminal emulator.
22:20  crilly: iTerm or soemthing
22:21  alexbobP: spaces just seems like a bad implementation of multiple desktops
22:21  alexbobP: on mac os x, I'm better off just using expose then trying to deal with spaces
22:21  crilly: Nah Spacea are very nicely implemented actually. I hardily use them though
22:21  crilly: Expose is fine, as you said alexbobP 
22:21  alexbobP: if spaces are nicely implemented, how do I hotkey them?
22:22  alexbobP: on linux, I have 9 spaces in a 3x3 grid, and I hit ctrl-shift-numpadkey to go to them
22:22  alexbobP: so it's really convenient
22:22  alexbobP: spaces are annoying if all I have is a hotkey for relative moving
22:22  cryptic0: ok guys, I am not trying to get a spaces war here.
22:22  crilly: I have mine setup as Control+Arrow Keys to move between them, or F6 to "Expose" the Spaces.
22:22  crilly: I only have two spaces
22:23  alexbobP: well I guess with only two spaces the arrow keys are fine :P
22:23  webPragmatist: zer0her0: meh i'm not a fan when they just blatantly destroy cars on that show
22:23  cryptic0: alexbobP:  I tilt my mouse scroll button to activate spaces, its a lot more convenient. 
22:24  alexbobP: cryptic0: what do you mean "activate"?  does it switch to the next space or something?
22:24  crilly: Can't see what's wrong with this: http://cl.ly/2u4D
22:24  webPragmatist: I'd use spaces if i had like very specific workflows which didn't intermingle
22:24  cryptic0: no, it shows a bird's eye view of all of the spaces.
22:24  alexbobP: oh... well that sounds cool, but again, not related to the feature I expect from multiple desktops
22:25  alexbobP: which is to be able to hotkey each desktop to a different hotkey
22:25  webPragmatist: like if one day i woke up and wa slike……. i'm going to write a book, which has nothing to do with web development
22:25  cryptic0: currently I am using 6 spaceworks,
22:25  zer0her0: webPragmatist: they can't destroy it ;)
22:25  alexbobP: as long as that feature still doesn't work, I will still say spaces are a poor implementation of multiple desktops
22:25  CPng|N: I have hot keys for each of my Spaces
22:25  webPragmatist: anyway
22:25  alexbobP: oh, so it *is* there?
22:25  webPragmatist: back to work
22:25 * alexbobP checks his mac thing agian
22:25  CPng|N: configFail
22:25  zer0her0: time to go teach actually
22:25  zer0her0: lata guys
22:26  CPng|N: defaults to CTRL+1,2,3,4 I think. I made mine ctrl+shift+1,2,3,4
22:26  CPng|N: and I have ctrl+shift+arrow_keys to move around
22:26  alexbobP: ooh, "to switch directly to a space"...
22:26  alexbobP: it was here the whole time
22:27  alexbobP: I feel dumb XD
22:27  CPng|N: tsk tsk
22:27  alexbobP: spaces are perfectly fine after all!
22:27  cryptic0: switching is just ctrl+arrow
22:27  CPng|N: (by default, not on mine)
22:27  cryptic0: if you want to see all spaces at once, fn+f8
22:27  cryptic0: CPng|N:  not on mine either: I use tilt wheel to do fn+f8
22:27  alexbobP: although it's stuck on the arrows, it doesn't let me change that
22:28  alexbobP: I would want to use 789iopkl; as 123456789
22:28  CPng|N: hold the extra modifier keys you want
22:28  CPng|N: they'll show up in the list automagically
22:29  CPng|N: oh, yeah you're not going to get that
22:29  CPng|N: maybe if you used that enhanced app. EnhancedSPaces or whatever he calls it now
22:29  alexbobP: because making a key bind dialog is too hard for apple ^^
22:29  alexbobP: nah... just kidding...
22:30  alexbobP: they could do it, but they know it would confuse their users ;)
22:32  CPng|N: yah well, there are plenty of "advanced" areas, this could be one of them
22:32  CPng|N: but whatever
22:32  CPng|N: on the other hand, at least Spaces rarely, if ever, crashes, and works well with videos and such
22:45  the_rogue_smiler: I need help with my mac pc
22:45  CPng|N: which is it? mac or pc?
22:45  b3ny0-: mac pc?
22:45  the_rogue_smiler: My mac pc
22:45  alexbobP: yeah dude, pc stands for "personal computer"
22:45  alexbobP: not "personal mac"
22:45  the_rogue_smiler: Well, my computer is a mac.
22:46  alexbobP: no, your *mac* is a mac
22:46  alexbobP: computers are a different sort of thing
22:46  alexbobP: they don't run mac os
22:46  b3ny0-: yes its a personal computer but you usually don't mention it for macs
22:46  b3ny0-: :)
22:46  the_rogue_smiler: ok let's say I have a car, but it is a saturn.
22:46  Tomis: there's macs
22:46  the_rogue_smiler: It is both a car and a saturn
22:46  jeremyw: Let's stop with the debate...what do you need help with?
22:46  Tomis: and then there's craps
22:47  CPng|N: macs n craps
22:47  CPng|N: tonight at 11
22:47  Tomis: best cereal ever CPng|N 
22:47  CPng|N: crunchy yet soft
22:47  Tomis: and fileld with viruses
22:47  the_rogue_smiler: Well, it keeps freezing up
22:47  CPng|N: so, the problem. What is it, we have yet to hear.
22:47  Tomis: as well as fruit
22:47  CPng|N: fruity virii mmm
22:47  CPng|N: Check Console.app
22:48  Tomis: check activity monitor.app, look at your ram usage the_rogue_smiler 
22:48  CPng|N: and Activity Monitor
22:48  alexbobP: don't be silly, macs just work
22:48  alexbobP: there's no need to debug why it's freezing up because it's obviously not
22:48  Tomis: also look at CPU usage
22:48  alexbobP: perhaps you are on drugs that are impacting your impression of time passage?
22:48  CPng|N: it's the "pc" side that's freezing apparently
22:48  Tomis: it could be some process running amuck eating all the resources
22:48  CPng|N: gobble gobble!
22:48  the_rogue_smiler: nvm it just unfroze
22:49  Tomis: is it random apps? or always the same apps freezing
22:49  alexbobP: if there were a "pc side", it would have a bios that would be able to boot from usb drives
22:49  CPng|N: I can boot my macs from USB
22:49  Tomis: and can you interact with other applications while it's frozen
22:49  the_rogue_smiler: is 4039 mb ram usage bad?
22:49  alexbobP: CPng|N: can you boot linux or windows from usb? 
22:49  CPng|N: 4 gigs of ram? holy crap. which app is that?
22:49  Tomis: out of what total the_rogue_smiler 
22:49  alexbobP: CPng|N: seems to me macs will only boot from usb if you have a guid partition table on your usb drive
22:50  CPng|N: alexbobP:  I don't know, as I don't care to find out.
22:50  alexbobP: CPng|N: okay... assume I'm right then :D
22:50  the_rogue_smiler: CPng|N, it is hard to tell. I have 50 tabs open
22:50  the_rogue_smiler: each tab has about 15 or more tabs open
22:50  CPng|N: well there's a problem right there, especially if flash is running in them
22:50  Tomis: huh
22:50  Tomis: that doesn't make sense the_rogue_smiler 
22:50  CPng|N: what do you have which has tabs within tabs?
22:50  CPng|N: it's SuperUltraApp!
22:51  Tomis: are you looking at the actual memory usage, or the virtual memory usage
22:51  Tomis: how much free ram do you have
22:51  the_rogue_smiler: Well you know how if you run a program, you see its icon in the tray at the bottom
22:51  the_rogue_smiler: I was calling that a tab
22:51  alexbobP: if every tab has multiple tabs, then don't you either have an infinite amount of tabs, or none?
22:51  Tomis: um, no those are applications
22:51  the_rogue_smiler: and if you are browsing the internet, the browser can have tabs
22:51  the_rogue_smiler: ok applications then
22:51  Tomis: and windows are not tab
22:52  Tomis: tabs are within windows
22:52  alexbobP: the_rogue_smiler: this will blow your mind: you can actually have tabs inside of tabs inside of tabs
22:52  the_rogue_smiler: ok applications whatever
22:52  Tomis: if you've got 50 apps open, then you're likely paging to all hell
22:52  rcmaehl: wouldn't be surprised if the_rogue_smiler had like 12MB of ram left
22:52  alexbobP: if you open the safari tab and the firefox tab, you can open multiple window tabs in those, and then open multiple tab tabs in each window tab
22:52  Tomis: so it's freezing up when swapping to/from disk
22:52  the_rogue_smiler: it just froze up again
22:52  the_rogue_smiler: I am going to turn it off.
22:52  alexbobP: yeah this is called swapping
22:52  alexbobP: you are using up all your ram
22:53  alexbobP: happens on any os :P
22:53  Tomis: how many applications do you have open, how much ram do you have installed, how much ram do you have free/inactive
22:53  rcmaehl: alexbobP: what about like terminal and console oses
22:53  alexbobP: rcmaehl: what about them?
22:53  rcmaehl: like MS-DOS and stuff didn't have swapping did they?
22:54  alexbobP: well I don't think ms-dos supported swap at all, so I guess not...
22:54  Tomis: in the early days no, because there wasn't a hard drive to swap to
22:54  alexbobP: I should say any *modern* os :P
22:54  rcmaehl: O_o
22:54  the_rogue_smiler: I have another question
22:54  the_rogue_smiler: Can I install windows on my mac PC? 
22:54  alexbobP: if your OS doesn't have swap memory or you have it turned off or whatever, then it's simple... when you run out of ram programs will just start crashing
22:54  Tomis: stop saying "mac PC"
22:54  alexbobP: no freezes or slowdowns
22:54  Tomis: it's a mac
22:54  staticsafe: the_rogue_smiler: yes, via bootcamp
22:55  Tomis: and yes, you can run windows in a VM, or directly via what apple calls bootcamp
22:55  the_rogue_smiler: I tried installing windows on mac before but it tried to wipe my hard drive.
22:55  alexbobP: I recommend vmware fusion
22:55  Tomis: just run bootcamp assistant the_rogue_smiler 
22:55  Tomis: it will step you through the whole process
22:55  alexbobP: but bootcamp works too if you want true dual-boot
22:56  Tomis: i'd recommend using a VM though, it's much cleaner
22:56  the_rogue_smiler: vmware?
22:56  Tomis: you can delete it with ease
22:56  Tomis: no repartitioning needed
22:56  the_rogue_smiler: I was just wondering about it.
22:59  CPng|N: best recommendation is to stop using windows
22:59  rcmaehl: He's not
22:59  alexbobP: well if you wanna follow that line, we should also say to stop using os x, and just go with ubuntu
22:59  rcmaehl: O_o
22:59  the_rogue_smiler: This computer I am using now has ubuntu on it.
22:59  alexbobP: cool
23:00  the_rogue_smiler: I have another question.
23:00  the_rogue_smiler: How can I jailbreak my iphone?
23:00  Tomis: google the_rogue_smiler 
23:00  Tomis: tons of guides on it
23:00  staticsafe: the_rogue_smiler: which iPhone?
23:00  staticsafe: but Google is good
23:00  Tomis: it's a dead simple process these days
23:00  the_rogue_smiler: lol jk
23:00  CPng|N: I would also recommend stop using ubuntu unless it's your server ;)
23:00  the_rogue_smiler: I dont have an iphone
23:01  alexbobP: CPng|N: why?
23:01  CPng|N: cuz you have a mac
23:01 * staticsafe uses Ubuntu on his main desktop
23:01  TechnoticRacoon: and?
23:01  alexbobP: heh
23:01  alexbobP: well I prefer ubuntu to mac os x, but I'm running os x on my mac for the battery life right now
23:01  alexbobP: although I'm starting to suspect that the battery life difference isn't so great, and os x just lies about how much time is remaining
23:01  alexbobP: I'm gonna do a test some time to find out for sure
23:02  the_rogue_smiler: Ok, my mac pc is running now :)
23:02  alexbobP: dude macs aren't pcs
23:02  CPng|N: no ubuntu doesn't properly scale the CPU back, so while you're just sitting there it's running the cpu at full power, sucking away battery life for no reason
23:02  CPng|N: or so I've heard
23:03  alexbobP: CPng|N: yeah, I know the battery life is better on os x, because apple has proprietary power management protocols that they won't publish
23:03  the_rogue_smiler: alexbobP, my Personal Computer is a Mac
23:03  alexbobP: the_rogue_smiler: then it's not a computer, we've been over this
23:03  alexbobP: the_rogue_smiler: computers have BIOS
23:03  the_rogue_smiler: What are BIOS?
23:03  CPng|N: oh just quit that nonsense will ya
23:03  staticsafe: not necessaril;y
23:03  staticsafe: BIOS = PC
23:03  alexbobP: the bios is the chip that starts a computer and boots from stuff
23:03  staticsafe: nope
23:03  staticsafe: uhm nvm
23:03  alexbobP: it deals with hardware directly
23:03  alexbobP: and finds an os
23:04  CPng|N: some "PCs" have EFI too
23:04  CPng|N: and they're not macs
23:04  alexbobP: oh.  well I hope they have a better EFI image than apple provides
23:04  Condoulo: ewwww @ EFI
23:04  alexbobP: because I'd be pissed if I bought a pc and couldn't boot a linux flash drive :P
23:04  alexbobP: but apparently that's normal for a mac
23:04  Tomis: anyway, it sounds like your mac is just low on memory because you're trying to run too much at once
23:04  Tomis: so run less at once, or get more ram
23:04  CPng|N: you'd all be screwed if you had to work on an old Sun system. lol
23:05  CPng|N: close yer damn tabs! ™
23:05  alexbobP: CPng|N: I'd be fine, I'd just install gentoo
23:05  the_rogue_smiler: So a mac is NOT a computer?
23:06  alexbobP: right
23:06  CPng|N: your comment scared Adium to death
23:06  alexbobP: a computer is any device that uses electronic logic to do computations, and that isn't made by apple
23:07  the_rogue_smiler: You made that up.
23:07  alexbobP: nuh-uh
23:07  the_rogue_smiler: My mac is a computer and it is mine. 
23:07  the_rogue_smiler: It is my personal computer (PC)
23:07  Tomis: a PC is a computer that isn't a mac
23:07  alexbobP: yeah, it probably is yours... unlike your iphone!  (if you have one and it's not jailbroken)
23:07  alexbobP: Tomis: so a PC is a computer?
23:07  CPng|N: your PC definition comes from commercials
23:08  Condoulo: Tomis, So that means I wouldnt' want to use a Mac because everything I use would be tracked or seen by somebody else because its not "Personal" ;)
23:08  Tomis: a mac is a type of computer that isn't a PC
23:08  Leedsman: Doesn't PC just stand for personal computer? So wouldn't it encompass both Mac and IBM clone?
23:08  alexbobP: a mac isn't a computer bro, it's a mac
23:08  Condoulo: I like computers that are personal. :P Especially Linux computers that are personal
23:08  Tomis: yes, in colloquial terms there is a difference Leedsman 
23:08  Tomis: PC = computer that isn't a mac
23:08  TechnoticRacoon: lol
23:08  TechnoticRacoon: and lemme guess
23:08  Condoulo: Mac = Personal Computer. So Mac = PC 
23:09  TechnoticRacoon: iphone= phone that isnt made by apple
23:09  Tomis: no Condoulo 
23:09  Condoulo: unless Steve Jobs tracked the kind of pr0n you watch 
23:09  CPng|N: s/isn't/is/
23:09  alexbobP: okay I've been trolling this whole time with the "macs aren't computers" bit, but I'm gonna come clean to clean up the confusion
23:09  alexbobP: PC stands for "personal computer" and was applied to pretty much every computer
23:09  alexbobP: but Apple turned it into "computer that's not a mac" for marketing reasons
23:09  the_rogue_smiler: they were selling mugs at the apple store the other day.
23:09  alexbobP: so they can do "mac vs pc" ads
23:09  the_rogue_smiler: They called them "iCups"
23:09  CPng|N: exactly
23:09  Tomis: not really alexbobP 
23:09  Tomis: it's been like that for years
23:09  Condoulo: Tomis, so you're saying Steve Jobs IS tracking the kind of pr0n you watch? So I'd rather keep my pr0n on Linux. :P 
23:09  alexbobP: Apple chose to not call their computers PCs so that they could differentiate them
23:10  Tomis: there are PCs, and then there are Macs
23:10  CPng|N: again, marketing
23:10  alexbobP: Tomis: yes, it's been like that for years, because apple wanted it so
23:10  Condoulo: PC stands for Personal Computer. =P 
23:10  torchie: apple just uses "PC" as short for "windows PC"
23:10  torchie: done
23:10  TechnoticRacoon: there are PCs, and then there are Macs
23:10  torchie: everybody shut up
23:10  alexbobP: Tomis: it's not like the definition of PC is some fundamental truth about the universe, it's just human language
23:10  CPng|N: now go away little lemmings
23:10  Tomis: not really
23:10  Condoulo: and Macs must not be personal or private because Steve Jobs tracks your Pr0n. ;) 
23:10  TechnoticRacoon: err
23:10  TechnoticRacoon: crao
23:10  Tomis: macs have always been different
23:10  TechnoticRacoon: crap*
23:10  Tomis: never bog standard PCs
23:10  Leedsman: Marketing definitions =/= literal definitions though
23:10  the_rogue_smiler: My brother likes his ipad. It makes a perfect buffer between his laptop and his legs.
23:10  Condoulo: Tomis, Macs haven't been different since 2006. 
23:11  torchie: what
23:11  alexbobP: Tomis: guess what: PCs had always been different from other PCs, for long before they standardized on x86
23:11  CPng|N: how's Jobs' ass taste?
23:11  alexbobP: Tomis: didn't stop everyone except Apple from calling their things PCs
23:11  Tomis: having an intel chip doesnt mean they're the same as a dell Condoulo 
23:11  torchie: just because it's on the same processor architecture automatically makes it the same?
23:11  torchie: I guess the ibook is the same as the nintendo gamecube
23:11  Tomis: they're still customized and tweaked as apple sees fit
23:11  Condoulo: Tomis, its pretty much the same architecture. They took a step back by going to x86. =) 
23:11  torchie: and the game boy color is the same as the ipad
23:11  Tomis: hence the bootcamp drivers for running windows on a mac
23:11  TechnoticRacoon: so what your saying is that your fetish for apple products is soo strong that you will even go to say that they are mentally different from each other Tomis? if so then your one fucked up sociopath
23:11  torchie: and the wonderswan is the same as the thinkpad T61
23:11  Tomis: no, they took a step forward by dropping the anemic dead-ended PPC
23:12  rcmaehl: torchie: by the communitive property yes
23:12  Condoulo: PPC was an amazingly powerful architecture. Much more advanced than x86 
23:12  torchie: same processor architecture right
23:12  the_rogue_smiler: I still have an old IBM
23:12  torchie: let's go run windows on our wonderswans
23:12  torchie: because software is so separate from hardware
23:12  CPng|N: hey wasn't today supposed to be that apple conference??
23:12  rcmaehl: torchie: stop trolling
23:12  torchie: that's tomorrow
23:12  CPng|N: ah
23:13  Condoulo: Tomis, well, lets see. A Macbook Pro will have a Core 2 Duo CPU, a crappy hard drive (Seagate's quality has gone through the crapper), and standard DDR2/DDR3 laptop memory. =) 
23:13  alexbobP: I'm gonna go run mac os x on my pc since software is separate from hardware
23:13  alexbobP: amirite
23:13  alexbobP: oh wait I crossed the forbidden line... ::braces for banning:
23:13  b3ny0-: the hardware inside is hardly revolutionary
23:13  Condoulo: Tomis, and don't forgot the awesome BSD base they use for an operating system. =D 
23:13  alexbobP: yep, that part of os x is rock solid
23:13  the_rogue_smiler: I am thinking about getting a Macbook Wheel.
23:14  TechnoticRacoon: ooh
23:14  alexbobP: kudos to apple for at least being smart enough to not crappily code their whole OS like microsoft does
23:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
23:14  rcmaehl: Mac, Windows, and Linux are all binary, so can't we all just get along?
23:14  TechnoticRacoon: windows isnt a bad os
23:14  the_rogue_smiler: What do you guys think of the macbook wheel?
23:14  Leedsman: No, it's terrible
23:14  b3ny0-: windows 7 is actually pretty good
23:14  TechnoticRacoon: it beats osx in the graphics department
23:14  Condoulo: the awesome part of UNIX-type Operating systems: they're generally a lot more modular than Windows. 
23:14  CPng|N: lol Leedsman beat me to it
23:14  alexbobP: windows 7 is okay, windows xp is okay, windows vista was crap
23:14  Condoulo: Windows 7 is nice - but a cluster<bleep>. Not really modular at all. 
23:14  the_rogue_smiler: Should I buy it?
23:14  b3ny0-: we have a saying in sweden "skit bakom spakarna"
23:14  TechnoticRacoon: osx= horrible for graphics performance
23:14  the_rogue_smiler: The macbook wheel?
23:14  the_rogue_smiler: Anybody?
23:14  alexbobP: but ubuntu is still by far my OS of choice
23:14  Tomis: nice try the_rogue_smiler 
23:15  Leedsman: But everyone says it's good, but they're comparing it to the previous iterations
23:15  rcmaehl: the_rogue_smiler: what
23:15  torchie: windows core is lame 
23:15  alexbobP: it beats the crap out of windows or mac os x
23:15  b3ny0-: don't blame the system because you can't use it properly ;)
23:15  the_rogue_smiler: rcmaehl,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnLbv6QYcA
23:15  torchie: osx core is BERKELEY SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION YEEEEEEAH
23:15  rcmaehl: O_o
23:15  the_rogue_smiler: That is the new macbook
23:15  CPng|N: win 7 "appears" ok, but it's just pretty new interfaces clobbered on top of XP type stuff. if you dig deep you find the old dialogs for system prefs and such
23:15  torchie: windows 7 interface is aight
23:15  rcmaehl: CPng|N: O_o
23:15  CPng|N: they still need to do a proper rewrite
23:15  Condoulo: alexbobP, of course. Ubuntu 10.10 is an absolutely amazing release. Sure, not many eye-popping new features - but 7 didn't have that many either. Its the rock solid stability and the polish that makes it just absolutely awesome.
23:15  torchie: it's mostly alpha blending and fading glitz
23:15  b3ny0-: I think windows 7 is as stable and quick as OS X
23:16  Leedsman: Ubuntu is pretty good. Not everyone's cup of tea, but a very usable distro
23:16  torchie: meanwhile osx somehow uses mostly gray and people call it "colorful"
23:16  alexbobP: the only rewrite that microsoft could do to make their OS actually not suck, would be to rewrite it to adhere to POSIX.  And they will never do that, because they'll break their own industry standard compatibility for software.
23:16  TechnoticRacoon: lol
23:16  CPng|N: Try to install an old printer manually in win 7 and you'll soon discover all the shitty looking dialog boxes and such are still there
23:16  Condoulo: CPng|N, oh geez. Thats one thing I can't stand about Windows Vista/7, inconsistency in the UI. although its hard to find the same consistency OS X has in Linux - Canonical has been trying really really hard to achieve that. 
23:16  alexbobP: Condoulo: I haven't actually tried 10.10 yet!  still on 10.04.  What will I get with the upgrade?
23:16  torchie: are all the win7 dialogs the same as XP's
23:16  b3ny0-: although I use it mostly for games nowadays
23:16  torchie: because on XP I did quite a bit of digging to change things
23:16  KaOSoFt: Windows is a gaming platform.
23:16  Condoulo: alexbobP, a lot of bug fixes and polish .
23:16  Leedsman: torchie: Mostly gray is awesome for people doing photo/video
23:16  CPng|N: alexbobP:  even though every major release of windows touts backward compatability, yet everyone is plagued with problems and needing updates to their apps to run in the new OS
23:17  torchie: mostly gray is awesome period
23:17  rcmaehl: OMg
23:17  KaOSoFt: I use my MacBook for everyday use, except games.
23:17  rcmaehl: the mac book whell
23:17  rcmaehl: wheel
23:17  Leedsman: alexbobP: New font rendering
23:17  torchie: but people are always like omg apple is so flashy look at them do this that blah blah
23:17  rcmaehl: it looks awesome
23:17  alexbobP: consistesy is one thing that open source design is bad for, since multiple parts are made by different people working separately... but ubuntu still seems to beat windows at it, since microsoft is just bad at their jobs ^^
23:17  KaOSoFt: I sometimes play Quantz or Counter Strike: Source on it (through Steam for Mac), but that's it.
23:17  torchie: and really the interface is minimal and uses what's necessary
23:17  alexbobP: CPng|N: for 5+ year old windows software, wine on linux seems to have better compatbility than the latest windows itself
23:17  Condoulo: alexbobP, of course. One tend I've noticed Canonical has been taking - is trying to tie everything together and make things more consistent, as well as tie a lot of things into their Ubuntu One Service. 
23:18  torchie: ubuntu's got a leg up on windows with that software center, it's a pretty sweet way to get apps
23:18  CPng|N: alexbobP:  lol yeah, sad huh?
23:18  alexbobP: yeah, package management is great
23:18  alexbobP: CPng|N: indeed
23:18  the_rogue_smiler: I don't really like the ipad pc
23:18  b3ny0-: thing is, apple develops its os for less than a 100 different hardware configurations, while windows is for several million different types
23:18  the_rogue_smiler: Touch screens are irritating.
23:18  Tomis: then don't get it the_rogue_smiler 
23:18  Leedsman: apt-get and yum are beautiful tools
23:18  torchie: love the ipad
23:18  Tomis: hah, no touch screens are the future
23:18  torchie: and I want twenty of them
23:18  Tomis: and you're just trying to troll
23:18  CPng|N: the_rogue_smiler:  well get used to it, and expect a major announcement tomorrow
23:18  b3ny0-: with that in mind I think they did a great job
23:18  the_rogue_smiler: Buttons are a superior technology
23:19  torchie: buttons are dead.
23:19  alexbobP: CPng|N: but good for me, since I'd rather be on linux, and I'd also generally rather play games that were made before the whole "graphics over gameplay" revolution :D
23:19  Leedsman: alexbobP: MUDs? haha
23:19  alexbobP: I never really got into MUDs
23:19  CPng|N: adventure.exe
23:19  the_rogue_smiler: I can actually feel what I am pressing with keys, plus, I don't get my body oils all over the display nore does my hand get in the way of what I am trying to view.
23:19  alexbobP: the closest I come is probably roguelikes
23:19  the_rogue_smiler: *nor
23:20 --- luist_ is now known as luist
23:20  alexbobP: yeah, I'm having that issue too the_rogue_smiler
23:20  alexbobP: I want an android phone but most of them have *only* touchscreen
23:20  alexbobP: I can't stand the idea of not having a real keypad
23:20  CPng|N: Droid 2
23:20  the_rogue_smiler: Touchscreens are only useful for ipods and cell phones
23:20  b3ny0-: I couldn't either, but I learned to live with the iphone
23:20  alexbobP: I already have t-mobile so that limits my options
23:20  torchie: I like how we're in the midst of an human interface revolution
23:20  torchie: and all people can think about is
23:20  torchie: omg i'll get fingerprints on it
23:20  CPng|N: heh
23:20  the_rogue_smiler: My phone was good enough to at least include a keypad
23:20  alexbobP: I think the only way I could live with an iphone is if I can install android on it :P
23:21  Condoulo: I can't wait till the Exclusive deal between AT&T and Apple are overwith. 
23:21  b3ny0-: I wouldn't want android
23:21  Condoulo: Because I hate AT&T, and the iPhone being only on AT&T is the only thing I hate about the iPhone. 
23:21  b3ny0-: it doesn't have the apps I want
23:21  torchie: ugh anrdoid
23:21  Condoulo: b3ny0-, right now I'd rather have an Android than an iPhone. 
23:21  torchie: android*
23:21  alexbobP: well I wouldn't want ios, because it's... well, dumb.
23:21  the_rogue_smiler: I don't ask that much in a phone.
23:21  Condoulo: I wouldn't want iOS - because I hate AT&T 
23:21  the_rogue_smiler: I just want a phone.
23:21  b3ny0-: lucky I don't live in the US then
23:21  the_rogue_smiler: I don't need an entire Operating system on it
23:21  b3ny0-: here you can get an iphone with like 10 different carriers
23:22  S_SubZero: i have an iPhone 3GS for work and a Droid Incredible for my personal phone.  I like the iPhone more
23:22  torchie: the iphone is a phone
23:22  the_rogue_smiler: No it isnt
23:22  alexbobP: I want a phone where if App Maker A makes an app, and User B wants to install it, they can do so without the need for any middlemen
23:22  the_rogue_smiler: it is an iphone
23:22  alexbobP: the locked down app store is morally offensive to me
23:22  alexbobP: even if I thought apple was going to accept every app I'd want to use (which they won't)
23:22  Condoulo: Hell, even Apple is kicking themselves in the behind for the decision they made 3-4 years ago
23:22  alexbobP: I wouldn't be okay with them even having that veto power
23:22  b3ny0-: I like the idea that you can find it all in one place though
23:23  b3ny0-: not having to browse the internet, download a file, move it to your phone and install it manually
23:23  alexbobP: b3ny0-: I'm fine with them having an app store where you can find all the stuff
23:23  alexbobP: b3ny0-: but for them to prevent you from getting apps from other sources, is wrong.
23:23  alexbobP: they sell you this incredibly expensive piece of equipment and then they act like it was never yours
23:23  torchie: palm :D
23:23  Condoulo: then Jailbreak the thing? Sure, Apple may not like it or not support you - but its not illegal. At least here in the US
23:23  torchie: there's a main app catalog
23:24  alexbobP: Condoulo: I don't really like giving money to people who are trying to screw me over, even if they won't succeed
23:24  b3ny0-: yeah I'm not entirely comfortable with that either, but on the other hand, not many 3rd party apps are really worth it
23:24  alexbobP: Condoulo: if apple wants to middlefinger their customers I can just take my business elsewhere
23:24  Marvolo: The apps aren't worth it but the utilities are. SSH and SBSettings are pretty nifty.
23:24  alexbobP: jailbreaking is great, everyone with an iphone should do it, but I still don't even want to buy an iphone the way apple behaves
23:25  b3ny0-: I jailbreaked mine but it totally ruined my battery life for some reason
23:25  Condoulo: I want an iPhone - but at the same time I don't want one. I love the iPhone - but at the same time I hate AT&T. So yeah. :P
23:26  torchie_pre: eyo
23:26  Condoulo: alexbobP, also note: Some of the apps there are denied or removed from the Apple App Store were due to the fact AT&T didn't want them used on their network -  not that Apple didn't want them on the iPhone
23:26  alexbobP: haha palms
23:27  alexbobP: Condoulo: then that's an even *better* reason Apple shouldn't have set up the app store the way they did
23:27  alexbobP: Condoulo: because now they gave AT&T veto power over all of their users too :P
23:28  alexbobP: "We screw our users... but sometimes it's not because we want to... it's because we sold you chumps out to AT&T and *they* want to!"
23:28  CPng|N: yup
23:28  CPng|N: he won't be making that mistake again (he=jobs)
23:28  torchie_pre: so even apple's at the carrier's whim
23:28  CPng|N: people speculate he's going to pull away from intel too
23:29  alexbobP: well is Jobs gonna push an update that lets people install what they want?
23:29  torchie_pre: arm macs :D
23:29  alexbobP: or is he gonna say "Oops, sorry", and promise to not do the same thing *next* time he pioneers a new piece of tech?
23:29  Condoulo: torchie_pre, exactly. At least until 2012
23:29  Leedsman: NO!! There goes my machine that I can't mention in channel
23:29  CPng|N: they've loosened the restrictions already
23:29  Tomis: iOS is a walled garden alexbobP 
23:29  Tomis: that's the model they've chosen to go with
23:29  Condoulo: CPng|N, Away from Intel as the sole CPU manufacturer or away from x86/x86_64 as a whole?
23:29  nat2610: when you do a bundle (a .app) where do you put your dylib ? 
23:29  alexbobP: Tomis: that's what I've been complaining about this whole time, so obviously I'm well aware :P
23:30  Tomis: inside the bundle nat2610 
23:30  CPng|N: both? hell I dunno. we'll know more tomorrow (maybe)
23:30  nat2610: Tomis, which directory ? 
23:30  Tomis: look at other apps and where they put such things
23:30  Tomis: generally it's next to the binary
23:30  Tomis: but i don't think that's a strict requirement, just a general practice
23:30  Condoulo: CPng|N, I hope not away from the x86 architecture. They just finally dropped PPC support (sadly :(), so I can't see them moving away from x86. Maybe AMD Macs? 
23:31  alexbobP: that's funny, cuz gentoo didn
23:31  alexbobP: 't drop ppc support
23:31  Tomis: there have been rumors about them going ARM for the macs for years
23:31  Leedsman: Really? ARM?
23:31  Condoulo: Tomis, but you realize how much thats going to piss off consumers AND developers?
23:31  Leedsman: I'd never heard that
23:31  Tomis: but i think it's just rumors from the iPad stuff filtering up
23:31  alexbobP: that would be smart, arm is a good platform
23:31  alexbobP: Apple should just require all .app files to contain source code, then they will truly be universal
23:31  Tomis: people seeing little peices and the story changing as it got passed along
23:31  alexbobP: the mac os can just build on the fly, right!
23:32  Tomis: i said it was a rumor Condoulo 
23:32  Marvolo: Arm is in Nintendo DSes
23:32  Condoulo: I mean PPC to Intel was understandable - They've been with PPC for years. But to switch from PPC to x86 - and then from x86 to ARM would just be stupid
23:32  Tomis: some people think they will Condoulo 
23:32  Condoulo: Tomis, true. But if they do then Apple might as well screw off as far as I'm concerned. :P 
23:32  Tomis: i don't see how it would serve them in a business sense
23:32  Tomis: they *needed* to leave PPC
23:32  Tomis: IBM was dicking them over
23:33  Tomis: going intel also changed the perception of macs
23:33  alexbobP: ARM is in pretty much everything that isn't a PC, these days
23:33  Tomis: that was another advantage to going intel
23:33  torchie_pre: if they announce macbook air with 24 hour battery life
23:33  torchie_pre: I'm on
23:33  torchie_pre: like donkey kong
23:33  Condoulo: I'm not a fan of the Macbook Air at al
23:33  Tomis: i'd like to see them add BTO to replace the optical drive with a second hard drive or addition battery capacity torchie_pre 
23:34  Tomis: that would be freaking awesome
23:34  Tomis: macbook pro with 20 hour battery life
23:34  Condoulo: the Macbook Pro is beast.
23:34  Condoulo: the regular Macbook - meh. Plastic? eww. :P 
23:34  Tomis: i hope they don't up the MBP
23:34  Tomis: i got mine a couple months ago
23:34  Tomis: if they do update it i'll feel like an idiot
23:35  Tomis: i read through the mac buyers guide and everything
23:35  alexbobP: buying a regular macbook is pointless... may as well buy a normal pc
23:35  Marvolo: My '06 Macbook is still chugging along. 
23:35  alexbobP: at least with a macbook pro you can tell yourself that you're not paying double-price for your computing hardware, you're just paying a thousand bucks for an aluminum case
23:35  Marvolo: It is very worth the cost
23:35  Tomis: the regular macbook is severely overpriced or underpowered
23:35  alexbobP: *all* macs are severely overpriced
23:35  Marvolo: it's not too bad
23:36  torchie_pre: mine too
23:36  torchie_pre: but it's rickety and dying
23:36  torchie_pre: and I'm poor
23:36  Tomis: nah
23:36  Condoulo: alexbobP, not all of them. 
23:36  Condoulo: The Mac Mini and Macbook Air's are. 
23:36  Tomis: when you price out the higher end stuff it's pretty close
23:36  Condoulo: the Macbook Pro - eh. depends on what part of the upgrade cycle
23:36  alexbobP: Condoulo: is there a single mac that can be bought new for less than 150% *more* than a similar-spec pc?
23:36  Tomis: the low end stuff has higher margins
23:36  Condoulo: The Mac Pro - its over-kill, but not overpriced.
23:37  torchie_pre: I'd like a 15" pro
23:37  Tomis: yea, go spec 'em out alexbobP 
23:37  torchie_pre: then again that's a bit big
23:37  Tomis: when you match the specs up exactly, you find they're like $50 difference
23:37  alexbobP: I can get a laptop with a core i7, 8gb of ram, and a 1tb hard drive, for $1300
23:37  torchie_pre: hopefully it'll fit in my bag
23:37  alexbobP: from Apple, those specs cost me upwards of $3000
23:37  Condoulo: alexbobP, well, consider this: Go try to build yourself a Mac Pro - same specs, same build quality, and by same specs, same EXACT specifications. Don't forget the SERVER board, SERVER Processor, and ECC memory. 
23:37  Marvolo: I'd buy a mid-range apple tower. Something about as powerful as an iMac but not overdone like the Mac Pro
23:38  Marvolo: Which they don't make.
23:38  Marvolo: An iMac without the screen.. how much would that run?
23:38  Marvolo: $ wise
23:38  Tomis: that would be a mac mini Marvolo 
23:38  Condoulo: because you've got to remember - the Mac Pro is a Workstation - it uses workstation/server parts. So its not going to be cheap. And for whats in there, its a fair price. Just over-kill
23:38  Tomis: apple doesn't do mini towers
23:38  Marvolo: Eh I'm pretty sure the iMac surpasses the Mac Mini in power
23:39  Marvolo: Is there a reason for that Tomis?
23:39  Tomis: yes
23:39  Marvolo: Are they decidedly against them? 
23:40  Tomis: it's not in their financial interest
23:40  Tomis: the people who want mini towers are the cheep people
23:40  Tomis: that's not apple's market
23:40  Marvolo: I suppose your right. One can dream though.
23:41  alexbobP: Condoulo: I'm trying to compare but I can't find another computer with 12 cpu cores XD
23:41  Tomis: desktops are a dieing breed
23:41  Tomis: laptops are the ultimate all-in-one machine
23:41  alexbobP: Condoulo: I'll link you to the price comparisoon I did do though
23:41  alexbobP: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834220695&cm_sp=NotebookDeal-_-34-220-695-_-09162010
23:41  Leedsman: Tomis: I love my desktop
23:41  Marvolo: That's my setup at the moment 
23:41  Marvolo: '06 13" macbook with a 23" samsung
23:42  alexbobP: Condoulo: what does a macbook pro have that justifies having double that price tag for an i7 and 8gb ram?
23:42  Condoulo: alexbobP, I said Mac Pro, not Macbook Pro. 
23:42  alexbobP: Condoulo: I know, did you read what I wrote...
23:42  alexbobP: Condoulo: I couldn't find a match for the mac pro :P
23:42  alexbobP: Condoulo: I'm linking to the price comparison I did the other day that led me to say Apple is horribly overpriced
23:43  Condoulo: alexbobP, meh. The Macbook Pro isn't /that bad/. Plus, theres little to none chinese plastic. \
23:43  Tomis: it's got a 1.6GHz CPU alexbobP 
23:43  Tomis: that's not a comparison to the macbook pro at all
23:43  Marvolo: that's not a comparison to my macbook even
23:43  Tomis: exactly
23:44  Tomis: that's what i'm talking about, go find me a machine with specs identical to the mac and then come back and tell me the price difference
23:44  alexbobP: Condoulo: I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying the *price* is bad
23:44  Marvolo: Although it may be more efficient since it's a newer processor
23:44  Marvolo: my 1.8GHz is 4 years old
23:44  alexbobP: Condoulo: I can't find an i7 and 8gb macbook pro for less than twice as much as the computer I linked off newegg
23:44  Tomis: people compare machines with *kinda sorta* similar specs and then say the mac is wildly over priced
23:44  alexbobP: Condoulo: so it seems to me that if I want a laptop with an i7 and 7gb ram, macs are out of the question
23:44  alexbobP: *8gb
23:45  Tomis: you didn't even match them spec-for-spec!
23:45  alexbobP: Tomis: well that is why I linked it
23:45  alexbobP: Tomis: so you can tell me what parts are cheaper in the computer I linked
23:45  Marvolo: the Name
23:45  alexbobP: lol
23:45  alexbobP: 16:45:05 < Marvolo> Although it may be more efficient since it's a newer processor <-- of course it is, an i# core will spank the shit out of a core 2 core
23:46  Condoulo: meh. My laptop will stay a PC laptop for now anyway. Just got this Gateway Tablet for free. 1.8Ghz Core Duo, 1GB of RAM, 320GB HDD. I can upgrade the CPU to one of the first-gen Core 2 Duos which should hold it off for a couple more years, and upgrade the memory to 4GB. Sure, it'd be DDR2 memory, but still. :P
23:46  torchie_pre: sup
23:46  torchie_pre: man I want a laptop with a buttload of ram
23:46  torchie_pre: like 16gb
23:46  torchie_pre: then I'd win forever
23:46  Condoulo: meh. 
23:47  Condoulo: To me my Desktop is more important than my laptop 
23:47  Leedsman: Two Xeon processors themselves will set you back about $800
23:47  Condoulo: or powerful tasks this custom-built desktop servers its use. 
23:47  torchie_pre: desktops
23:47  torchie_pre: don't move
23:47  Condoulo: *serves
23:47  Condoulo: torchie_pre, and? When I'm on the go I'm not going to do what I normally do on my desktop. So why have all that power? 
23:48  alexbobP: Tomis: are you not going to tell me what's different?
23:48  torchie_pre: because pickles
23:48  alexbobP: torchie_pre: 16gb ram sounds awesome, I want it too :D
23:48  torchie_pre: all I know is
23:49  torchie_pre: I don't want another computer I can't immediately move

23:55  apn: No, because you still can unplug it and go your way. Beside, only mac has 2.
23:55  CPng|N: yep. different uses, and often different times of your life
23:55  CPng|N: sometimes you need both
23:55  b3ny0-: desktop is great too
23:55  remyo: b3ny0-: After having an iPhone for awhile a laptop is starting to feel more like a desktop :p
23:56  Condoulo: I like both Desktops and Laptops - and I see them both designed for separate purposes. 
23:56  b3ny0-: I don't see why you have to choose either
23:56  CPng|N: the difference has blurred together more than it used to years ago
23:56  apn: Condoulo, I see desktop as a expensive replacement for game console. That would be it.
23:56 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 79 seconds
23:56  CPng|N: since mobile cpu's and memory and GPUs and such have gotten so relatively powerful
23:56  diffract|: if you're using basic programs that don't requires lots of power, sure
23:57  apn: b3ny0-, $$$ Steve is not worth that much.
23:57  b3ny0-: remyo: I wouldn't compare a phone to a computer in the first place ;)
23:57  diffract|: why are high-end desktops only associated with games?
23:57  b3ny0-: Steve?
23:57  CPng|N: yeah it's a much different story for people doing CAD or compiling large apps or other work-heavy stuff.   or modern games.
23:57  apn: diffract|, because 99.9% that's what they are used for.
23:57  b3ny0-: I use desktop almost exclusively for games nowadays
23:57  remyo: b3ny0-: I know. But I sure use it a lot. And it's totally replaced some things I used to use my computer for
23:57  CPng|N: because people who do real work with them just buy them, expense them through work, and move on with their lives. 
23:57  Condoulo: apn, my desktop wasn't that expensive, and it isn't really high end. Its more of a mid-range build. Even though I wanna upgrade the hell out of it when I do get some money. 
23:58  diffract|: http://www.refractivesoftware.com/
23:58  CPng|N: people who game are usually in college, tight on money, and talk about it to everyone
23:58  diffract|: ^ this is a program that requires a high-end GPU
23:58  diffract|: and it's not a game
23:58  b3ny0-: I'm not in college, I don't talk about it with more people than I game with
23:58  apn: Condoulo, computers are really monetary black holes.
23:58  b3ny0-: I am tight on cash though
