09:13  EmilioTucci: Hi
09:13  EmilioTucci: any clue why CHROME works so badly in Mac OS, and why I can not make it to get into www.google.com since this morning?
09:13  EmilioTucci: I am using Firefox instead that is working like a charm
09:16 --- W0rmF00d is now known as WormFood
09:17  eagles0513875: hey guys any logic studio experts in here
09:22  EmilioTucci: GMAILS works, but GOOLE does not !!!!
09:22  EmilioTucci: How is this possible?
09:23  eagles0513875: ?
09:24  S_SubZero: I have chrome, I am looking at my igoogle custom page right now.
09:25  EmilioTucci: in my case, it keeps loading, and then it fails saying the web is taking too much
09:25  EmilioTucci: I have Firefox opened in google with no problem
09:25  EmilioTucci: as a matter of fact, I have the same Chrome window with another tab in gmail with no problem
09:25  EmilioTucci: ?
09:25  EmilioTucci: Chrome always gave me a lot of problems in this Mac Box, a new one, just 5 months
09:25  eagles0513875: what browser is giving you issue EmilioTucci
09:26  EmilioTucci: eagles0513875, Chrome
09:26  eagles0513875: EmilioTucci: tried clearing out the cache and histroy
09:26  eagles0513875: anyone know how to get a song to fade out at the end with logic studio
09:26  EmilioTucci: eagles0513875, I cleaned the cache and that worked, 
09:27  EmilioTucci: why ?
09:27  EmilioTucci: That does not happen in Safari or FF
09:27  eagles0513875: EmilioTucci: probably you had old cookies which had expired
09:29  EmilioTucci: for Google?
09:30  eagles0513875: possibly
09:30  eagles0513875: thats usually the first thing i do 
09:30  eagles0513875: on any browser when i start having issues clear out the history or temporary internet files etc
09:41 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
09:42  EmilioTucci: never happened that to mi with FF and Safari
09:52  eagles0513875: EmilioTucci: could be a small bug in chrome
10:10  lastn0de: hi, i was just wondering if anyone who has used both could tell me a little about why id want to go for a mbp 13" over a macbook, both current generation
10:12  manda_moore: what do you need it to do for you?
10:12  netdaemon: at the time i bought mine, the regular macbooks where only upgradable to 4 GB of ram, the MBPs where upgradable to 8 GB
10:13  netdaemon: that's why i went with a MBP
10:15  netdaemon: also DDR2 vs DDR3, that's obviously changed though
10:15  EmilioTucci: What I can only tell you that using comptuers since the 80's (Spectrum) until today, having used Windows for many years, and after using Linux for 6 years as well, I am completely delighted with the jump I did to Mac computers, specially the Mac Book Pro 13 4 Gb that I bought 5-6 months ago, I will never go back, I can't just imagine working the way I used to 
10:15  EmilioTucci: mine is 4Gb upgradable to 8Gb
10:15  lastn0de: i want to have a lightweight machine that can run photoshop decently and have an OK enough gpu to run starcraft 2 on low. the geforce 320m is fine for me, and the mb has 8-10 hours ofbattery life which is great.
10:15  EmilioTucci: yep, DDR3
10:15  lastn0de: i write about video games atm
10:15  lastn0de: and being mobile is important
10:15  netdaemon: personally: i'd spend a little more and get a MBP
10:15  lastn0de: i thought of a netbook but then most have sucky battery life and crap gpus
10:15  lastn0de: ok
10:15  netdaemon: check the specs first though
10:15  EmilioTucci: However I must say the new MB are really EXPENSIVE and wicker that the current ones
10:15  lastn0de: the MB is 1300$ where i live, MBP is about 1650$ or so
10:15 * netdaemon has a looksy
10:16  EmilioTucci: lastn0de, you can get a MB Pro 13"" for 1200 bucks directly from the store
10:16  lastn0de: EmilioTucci, no i cant
10:16  EmilioTucci: why?
10:16  lastn0de: i live in south east asia
10:16  EmilioTucci: ohh
10:16  EmilioTucci: I live in Spain
10:16  EmilioTucci: and I bought mine from the store in USA
10:16  netdaemon: lastn0de: looks like the upgradable bit still holds true
10:16  lastn0de: shipping?
10:16  EmilioTucci: then I had it sent to a colleague of mine there in US
10:16  EmilioTucci: and he shipped it to me :)
10:16  netdaemon: lastn0de: only up to 4 GB on the regular macbook
10:16  lastn0de:  i already have a hp dv6
10:16  lastn0de: which i use for heavy lifting
10:16  lastn0de: i just need soemthing with great abttery life
10:16  lastn0de: i can just toss in my backpack adn take around
10:17  EmilioTucci: up to 10 hours with mine (no WIFI)
10:17  lastn0de: MBP?
10:17  EmilioTucci: yep
10:17  netdaemon: in that case...
10:17  lastn0de: hmmm
10:17 * netdaemon looks at the GPU
10:17  lastn0de: gpu is the same
10:17  lastn0de: on both
10:17  lastn0de: and apple skimps with 256 for some reaosn t_t
10:18  lastn0de: the 320 standard comes with 512
10:18  lastn0de: it appears apple is cutting corners there, and i dunno why
10:18  EmilioTucci: however if you are workign with WIFI then at least mine, goes down to 4 - 5 horu
10:18  EmilioTucci: hours
10:18  lastn0de: maybe for 13" u dont need more than that
10:18  lastn0de: EmilioTucci, i use ethernet
10:18  netdaemon: lastn0de: go with a macbook then
10:18  netdaemon: unless you want aluminum unibody
10:18  lastn0de: netdaemon, ok, what's your rationale?
10:18  lastn0de: someone in #apple just said the build quality is better
10:18  EmilioTucci: the aluminym body is actually the soul
10:18  netdaemon: lastn0de: you say you want something small, you got another lappy for heavy lifting
10:18  lastn0de: yeah
10:18  EmilioTucci: it is a beauty art thing
10:19 +Tomis: the 13" aren't pro machines
10:19  lastn0de: is the MBP heavier?
10:19 +Tomis: the pro line starts at the 15"
10:19  EmilioTucci: I get calmed just touching my MB 
10:19  EmilioTucci: ..
10:19  EmilioTucci: it's hypnotic :)
10:19  netdaemon: Tomis: no, they start at 13"
10:19 +Tomis: no netdaemon 
10:19  netdaemon: i'm speaking to you on a 13" pro
10:19  lastn0de: Tomis, www.apple.com/mac/
10:19 +Tomis: look at the specs
10:19  netdaemon: http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro?mco=MTM3NDc0NDI
10:19 +Tomis: the 13" is not a pro machine
10:19  netdaemon: look at the store
10:19 +Tomis: it's a joke
10:20  EmilioTucci: Tomis, yea, but 15" and above you lose "mobility"
10:20 +Tomis: it's a macbook in a suit with a firewire port thrown in
10:20 +Tomis: and the whole damn line should have FW to begin with
10:20  lastn0de: Tomis, then you should prolly say it's not "pro"
10:20  netdaemon: and more upgradability as far as ram goes
10:20  lastn0de: because when you say it's not pro
10:20  lastn0de: we thought you had got your facts wrong
10:20  lastn0de: ..
10:20 +Tomis: i's not a pro
10:20  lastn0de: it's branded macbook pro
10:20 +Tomis: pro is three letters of marketing
10:20 +Tomis: it's BS
10:20  lastn0de: you're just saying it doesnt live up to the pro name
10:20  lastn0de: yeah, ok
10:20  lastn0de: anyway
10:20  EmilioTucci: what's pro then?
10:20 +Tomis: the 15" and above
10:20  netdaemon: sager notebook
10:20  LSD`: lastn0de: When Apple first launched it, it carried the MacBook title with no Pro suffix :P
10:20  netdaemon: j/k
10:20  lastn0de: LSD`, yes, im aware of that
10:21  lastn0de: LSD`, i was referring to Tomis saying ther eis no pro 13" when there clearly is
10:21 +Tomis: modern CPU, decent GPU, better system specs overall
10:21  EmilioTucci: For me pro is being able to work on my stuff in a 10 hours flight before visiting the customer and not worring about lack of battery
10:21  lastn0de: and then realising he was expressing an opinion
10:21  lastn0de: adn being cryptic at it
10:21  EmilioTucci: Tomis, I think modern CPUs does not mean pro
10:21 +Tomis: no it's a fact, the 13" pro is a joke
10:21  netdaemon: wow, stating opinion as fact
10:21 +Tomis: just a macbook in a different case with FW thrown in
10:22  LSD`: The 13" MBP really gets the short end of the stick, but there's not an awful lot Apple can do with it atm :/
10:22  LSD`: Hopefull Intel will can the Core 2s in the not too distant and force their hand
10:22 +Tomis: they could put decent specs in the machine instead of deliberately gimping the thing
10:22  EmilioTucci: if I have a 17" with the latest CPU, then my battery will last for 3 hours ? in the best case, and I will need a bigger bag to carry the heavy laptopo all over the airports, taxiss, etc..
10:22  lastn0de: i agree the MBP should be higher speced
10:22  lastn0de: that seems like a lot of money
10:22  EmilioTucci: for me good mobility->Pro :)
10:22  lastn0de: for 2 gigs of ram
10:23  lastn0de: and a few hz
10:23  lastn0de: on the proc
10:24 +Tomis: 8 hours with i5 on the 15" EmilioTucci 
10:24  EmilioTucci: Not true
10:24  EmilioTucci: I tested one
10:24 +Tomis: they could pull that on the 13", they're just being cheep and milking that Core 2 for all it's worth
10:24  EmilioTucci: before getting this
10:24  EmilioTucci: and it did not go beyond 3 hours
10:24 +Tomis: depends on what you're doing of course EmilioTucci 
10:24  EmilioTucci: That is why I went down to the 13"
10:24  LSD`: Tomis: The problem wit hthe 13" though is there's no room to really put a decent GPU if they switch it out for an i3-M or something
10:24  EmilioTucci: if I want power I get an iMac
10:24  EmilioTucci: if I want mobility, I get a laptop-> MBP
10:24 +Tomis: run the screen at full brightness while maxing the CPU and GPU, of course you'll get less
10:24 +Tomis: lies LSD` 
10:25 +Tomis: they egineer for what they choose to put in the machine
10:25  netdaemon: there's a problem of heat too
10:25 +Tomis: just like when they removed FW and everyone was like "there's no room for it!"
10:25 +Tomis: yea, because they choose to remove it, of course there's no room for it, lol
10:25  EmilioTucci: But why I would need the latest GPU in a laptop desigend for mobility and for efectivinees, Production?
10:25 +Tomis: anyway, when deciding the machine to get, decide what you need, and watch you're willing to spend
10:26 +Tomis: and then question what you really need
10:26  EmilioTucci: exactly
10:26  EmilioTucci: That is why, in my case I have:
10:26  EmilioTucci: - mobility and work : MB
10:26  LSD`: Tomis: except a firewire chip is lucky if it's 1cm^2, you're looking at 8 if you put a H55 chipset and half decent GPU in, and there's just no room in the current 1`3" chassis design
10:26  EmilioTucci: - Web and media server at home -> Debian Linux
10:26 +Tomis: yea, i can't see myself getting a new desktop for a while
10:26  EmilioTucci: - Programming, videio and sound edition, etc.. ->iMac
10:27  EmilioTucci: -> Games (PlayStation & Windows XP) :)
10:27  lastn0de: Tomis, so ud say mb is a better option than mbp?
10:27  netdaemon: iMacs are just laptops crammed into LCD screens :|
10:27 +Tomis: by the time this 15" is too slow, it'll likely be time to get a new one anyway
10:27  lastn0de: i said iw ant to run photoshop/some games on low resos/settings
10:27  lastn0de: and have great battery
10:27 +Tomis: if you're doing jack-all, a macbook is fine
10:27  lastn0de: when doing other stuff
10:27 +Tomis: most people are doing jack-all
10:27  lastn0de: i have a dv6 for
10:27  lastn0de: heavy gfx
10:27  LSD`: Tomis: The GT320 or whatever the hell nVidia are calling the 9400M now is just one chip that combines nortbridge, southbridge and GPU, you need seperate PCH and GPU chips if you go for an i3-M
10:27  netdaemon: i'd say a macbook
10:27 +Tomis: are you a heavy photoshop user?
10:28 +Tomis: or just some light photo editing
10:28  lastn0de: im a video game writer so i need to do some editing
10:28  lastn0de: but not huge images
10:28  lastn0de: biggest is A4 size 
10:28  lastn0de: adn even on mydv6
10:28  lastn0de: with 2gig
10:28  lastn0de: i manage that ok
10:28 +Tomis: the ipad has an A4!
10:28 +Tomis: get an ipad
10:28  lastn0de: lol
10:28 +Tomis: bom, problem solved
10:28 +Tomis: glad to help
10:28  lastn0de: thx Tomis 
10:28 +Tomis: yea for what you're talking about, i'm tempted to tell you to go for a decent machine
10:29 +Tomis: but the macbook may be sufficient for you
10:29 +Tomis: what are you on now?
10:29  EmilioTucci: Tomis, what is the decent machine?
10:29 +Tomis: for the laptops, the 15" pro EmilioTucci 
10:29 +Tomis: anything less than that is for consumers doing jack-all
10:29  EmilioTucci: isn't it big for you? ena heavy?
10:29 +Tomis: and it's fine for them
10:30  lastn0de: Tomis, hp dv6 15.6"
10:30 +Tomis: not really EmilioTucci 
10:30  EmilioTucci: do you travel?
10:30 +Tomis: if they'd had the 13" with the specs of the 15" i would have gotten it though
10:30  EmilioTucci: me too of course
10:30 +Tomis: what's the weight different between them, like 1/2 lb?
10:31  EmilioTucci: but the 13" is lighter and small, perfect for travelling
10:31 +Tomis: i don't travel extensively, that is a valid point in that instance
10:31  lastn0de: lolwut
10:31  LSD`: tbh, I wouldn't care if they launched an i3-M powered 13" with Intel graphics if it meant getting rid of that godawful nVidia chipset
10:31  lastn0de: 13" MBP has shared gpu memory?
10:31  EmilioTucci: yeah, in my case I travel 75% of time 
10:31 +Tomis: yes lastn0de 
10:31  lastn0de: ...
10:31 +Tomis: it's a crap integrated GPU
10:31  lastn0de: you're right Tomis 
10:31  lastn0de: i apologise
10:31  lastn0de: it's not pro at all
10:31 +Tomis: like i said, pro model starts at 15"
10:31 +Tomis: it's sad
10:31  LSD`: lastn0de: so does the 15 and 17" a large chunk of the time
10:31 +Tomis: disgusting really
10:31  EmilioTucci: and I can tell you that before this Mac I used to go with a HP Pavillion 14" with Linux, and it was a pain, specially for my back
10:32  lastn0de: why is apple so behind on tech?
10:32  lastn0de: theonly reason im considerign apple
10:32  lastn0de: is they are the onlypeople
10:32 +Tomis: because they can lastn0de 
10:32  lastn0de: who honour warranty
10:32  lastn0de: where i live
10:32  lastn0de: :(
10:32  lastn0de: them and HP
10:32  lastn0de: which is why i haev a HP
10:32 +Tomis: they're milking the crap out of the core 2
10:32 +Tomis: nice fat profit margins
10:32  LSD`: I don't care the 13" still has a Core 2, I just hate the fact it's on a crap chipset
10:33 +Tomis: yea i hope apple fixes the GPU thing LSD` 
10:33 +Tomis: there's an *excellent* 3rd party app, gfxCardStatus, lets you see which card the system is using, which process is causing it to use the full GPU, and force it to one GPU or the other
10:33  EmilioTucci: But, I was expecting Apple to come up with new models....instead they came up with the new "MacBooks" that look to me more like Net Books rather than new improveds models...I was very disappointed.  
10:34 +Tomis: and you can have it do this based on the power source too
10:34  lastn0de: macbook air
10:34  lastn0de: is a bit lol
10:34  lastn0de: engadget praises it for speed
10:34  lastn0de: due to ssd
10:34 +Tomis: ie, when on battery, force it to use integrated for better battery life, when on AC let it dynamically switch as needed
10:34  LSD`: EmilioTucci: The 11.6" MBA *is* a netbook, for all intents and purposes
10:34  lastn0de: then says it has less battery life than macbook
10:34  lastn0de: YAY
10:34  lastn0de: so we have a thinner, lighter machine
10:34  lastn0de: that can last less than the previous generation
10:34 +Tomis: that's really how apple should have set up the energy saver settings in the first place
10:34  lastn0de: sign me up!
10:35  EmilioTucci: LSD`, yeah, but I meant that I was expecting them to come up with new Mac Books models, like a 13" with iCore processors and so..but nothing
10:35  EmilioTucci: more Mac Air crap
10:35 +Tomis: well, what's mac buyers guide say EmilioTucci 
10:35 +Tomis: by the time line there should be some updates soon
10:36 +Tomis: they did do a quite refresh on the high end pro though
10:36 +Tomis: so who knows
10:36 +Tomis: *quiet
10:37  EmilioTucci: yeah, you know, I don't have a problem paying mor for a MBP 13" that gives me the current a) size, b) weight c) battery life, ....but they just don't make it!
10:37  lastn0de: oh wait these are still
10:37  lastn0de: 1280x800 too right?
10:37  LSD`: EmilioTucci: putting an i3-M, the H55M PCH, a decent GPU and VRAM in would require significant reengineering of the 13" chassis. The problem is mostly in the packaging of the PCH
10:37  lastn0de: that's still as "HD" as some tvs so np ;-)
10:37  LSD`: lastn0de: the new MBAs are 1366x768 I believe
10:38  lastn0de: yeah i mean MB/MBP LSD` 
10:38  EmilioTucci: I am seriously tempted all the time by getting an iPad
10:38  EmilioTucci: ..
10:38  lastn0de: dont plz
10:38  EmilioTucci: my brain just tells me NO
10:38  lastn0de: listen to it
10:38  EmilioTucci: :)
10:39  EmilioTucci: but man, I tryied one a week ago in a store, and now with the 4.1 os upgrade...
10:39  LSD`: I'd buy an iPad if I had the money. The 16GB Wifi is only AUD$629, which isn't too bad
10:39  lastn0de: apple's business plan is sick
10:39 +Tomis: i'd wait for gen 2
10:39  lastn0de: they release prodcuts without basic functionality (multitasking)
10:39  lastn0de: people buy it anyway
10:39  LSD`: Tomis: It's not going to offer anything I really care about
10:39  lastn0de: then they release the functionality
10:39  lastn0de: and people go NUTS
10:39  lastn0de: OMFG MUTLI TASKING GAIS
10:39  EmilioTucci: :9
10:39 +Tomis: it's going to get a higher res screen and a camera
10:40  lastn0de: their marketing department deserves honorary phds
10:40  LSD`: lastn0de: multitasking SUCKS, I'd rather Apple stuck to their guns and kept it to their own apps
10:40 +Tomis: want to know where the ipad and ipod touch are going? look at where the iphone is
10:40  lastn0de: LSD`, but why
10:40  EmilioTucci: I hate multitasking at least in the iPhone
10:40 +Tomis: so i'd wait
10:40 +Tomis: what's to hate about multitasking
10:40 +Tomis: you don
10:40  lastn0de: what do u mean Tomis 
10:40 +Tomis: t have to manage it or know it exists
10:40  EmilioTucci: Tomis, but when G2 comes up, you will also need just in case G3 brgins something new, ...it's a never ending story
10:41  LSD`: lastn0de: stuff hangs around in memory (even though Apple says it doesn't) slowing the whole device down over time. Not having to deal with multitasking is one of the reasons why I bought an iPhone to begin with
10:41  lastn0de: so what macs do you guys own atm? (just curious)
10:41  lastn0de: i see LSD` 
10:41  lastn0de: formost people though it'sa dealbreaker
10:41 +Tomis: of course EmilioTucci 
10:41  lastn0de: i never got one bcit wasexpensive
10:41  lastn0de: but also because i need IM
10:41 +Tomis: still, there are features that are obvious and notable missing
10:41  lastn0de: i mean real IM not push notifications
10:41  LSD`: lastn0de: those people are mostly idiots
10:41  lastn0de: im an idiot then
10:41  lastn0de: lol
10:41 +Tomis: camera is obvious, higher res screen is obvious
10:41  EmilioTucci: Tomis, I hate the way it works, any app you  open shows in the multitasking row, ...at the end of the day, you have 20000 apps there and you have to close them one by one. I would rather had an option to send the app to background if I wanted 
10:42 +Tomis: why are you manually managing them EmilioTucci 
10:42  EmilioTucci: what do you mean?
10:42 +Tomis: you know they're removing the "running" indicator from the dock in 10.7?
10:42  LSD`: iPad doesn't really need a camera, at least not until Apple get around to opening the APIs up to other developers
10:42  EmilioTucci: Tomis, I am talking about iPhone OS
10:42 +Tomis: the user shouldn't know, care, or understand the concept of applications running vs. not running
10:42 +Tomis: that's apple's philosophy now
10:42  lastn0de: does anyone here have a plain vanilla macbook?
10:43 +Tomis: so stop worrying about it
10:43  LSD`: You aren't going to be pulling it out of your bag to take happy snaps with it and Facetime only works over Wifi making it mostly useless
10:43 +Tomis: let the OS handle it all for you
10:43  LSD`: lastn0de: I have one from 2007
10:43  EmilioTucci: Tomis, are you talking about iPhone/iPad os?
10:43 +Tomis: same thing EmilioTucci 
10:43  lastn0de: LSD`, was it a good buy in ur opinion?
10:44 +Tomis: they're backporting the iOS behaviors to mac os x in 10.7
10:44  EmilioTucci: What I am saying is that in iPhone/iPad os, whenever you open an app, it is automatically sent to multitasking
10:44  EmilioTucci: why?
10:44  EmilioTucci: I don't need that
10:44 +Tomis: yes
10:44 +Tomis: of course
10:44  EmilioTucci: my resources are being consummed
10:44 +Tomis: no
10:44  LSD`: Now, if Skype or someone were able to use the front facing camera for video calls over 3G... Apple wouldn't approve the app because it would duplicate the functionality of FaceTime XD
10:44 +Tomis: unused resources are wasted resoruces
10:44  LSD`: EmilioTucci: That's not how iOS multitasking works
10:44 +Tomis: when system memory gets low, they suspend the oldest app
10:44  LSD`: EmilioTucci: just because it shows up in the dock, doesn't mean it's actually running
10:45  EmilioTucci: oh
10:45 +Tomis: also, with the multi-tasking API, app have to request time to do things
10:45  EmilioTucci: so why they show up then?
10:45 +Tomis: because you ran them!
10:45  EmilioTucci: if I already have their icon 
10:45  LSD`: EmilioTucci: My problem is that sever apps actually *do* leave pieces of themselves running, which use resources until there's not enough for other apps
10:45 +Tomis: it's just a history list
10:45  EmilioTucci: but why I would need to have a list of applciations that I ran?
10:45 +Tomis: so you can switch between them quickly
10:45 +Tomis: instead of having to find them again
10:45  EmilioTucci: mm
10:46 +Tomis: i want to run apps 1, 2, 3 and swtich quickly
10:46  LSD`: on a related subject, does the iPhone 3G get the app switcher, but just can't have apps running backgrounded?
10:46  EmilioTucci: So if I ran 100 apps in the last 3 months, I would get a list of 100 icones??
10:46 +Tomis: i'm done using app 2, now i want to run app 1,3, 4 and switch between them
10:46 +Tomis: it would probably max out at some point and kick things off the list
10:46 +Tomis: i'm nto sure how many it maxes at
10:47  EmilioTucci: you know, just looking at that long "salami" of apps that shows up in my backgrounding list, .. makes me to fell uncomfortable! 
10:47 +Tomis: lol
10:47  LSD`: Apple should find a way to put some weight on it so your most commonly used apps stay toward the front of the list.
10:47 +Tomis: good question LSD` 
10:47  EmilioTucci: so I start removing them..
10:47 +Tomis: well it's not really saving system resources EmilioTucci 
10:47  EmilioTucci: which became to be a daily task: empty your backgrounding list
10:48 +Tomis: just chill and let the system handle everything for you
10:48  LSD`: Tomis: I mean, I like the task switcher, I just hate that apps leave bits of themselves backgrounded
10:48  EmilioTucci: ok...
10:48 +Tomis: they don't though LSD` 
10:48 +Tomis: and when they do, the OS manages it
10:48 +Tomis: they get an finite ammount of time to finish an operation
10:48 +Tomis: the exceptions being media players and VOIP
10:49 +Tomis: but then you'd be aware of that
10:49 +Tomis: because you'd be using it
10:49  EmilioTucci: Tomis, but the "backgrounder", the non-official app, worked great; you had in background only what you wanrted (pressing the home button for a while), then you had a list of apps in background, and so...ver clean inmop
10:49 +Tomis: except that it was a failure of a hack EmilioTucci 
10:49  LSD`: ...so why do I have processes listed for apps that I'm not using, haven't used in absolutely ages and log after the 10 minute task completiong delay?
10:49 +Tomis: apps running fully and continuouly?
10:49 +Tomis: no
10:49 +Tomis: because you used them recently LSD` 
10:50  EmilioTucci: yeah, agreed, but I mean, it is a good style dea
10:50  EmilioTucci: *idea
10:50 +Tomis: and you shouldn't know, care, or understand the concept of an app running vs. not running
10:50  LSD`: Tomis: if the system actually worked as advertised, I wouldn't
10:50 +Tomis: as far as the user needs to know, apps are *always* persistent and ready to be used
10:50  EmilioTucci: Tomis,that is fine for a person that has not dealt with computers, but I have been using them for years, like many people, so we do care about that point :)
10:51 +Tomis: and you need to let that go EmilioTucci 
10:51 +Tomis: or use android
10:51  LSD`: Tomis: it should stay as fast in a week as it does when you first boot it up. Except it doesn't. Admittedly, 4.2.1 is a whole lot better, but it's still not as good as 3.1 used to be
10:51 +Tomis: well then that's a pretty crap design yea LSD` 
10:51  EmilioTucci: yep
10:51  LSD`: pre-4 iOS was perfectly able to provide the illusion of multitasking without actually enabling it
10:51 +Tomis: still, the paradign shift is here to stay
10:52 +Tomis: and multitasking was an essential an ineviatable step
10:52  EmilioTucci: good point, probably we should accept it and start changing our minds and adapting the new ways
10:52 +Tomis: and it think they implemented it well
10:52  LSD`: Tomis: tbf, it's not really Apple's fault, it's retarded app developers giving even more retarded users what they think they want/need
10:52  EmilioTucci: man, I feel now like and Old 19th century man being asked to use electricity
10:52 +Tomis: it's not a free-forall of apps being able to run continuously
10:53 +Tomis: there are some things for which apps need to be able to continue running in-part, while not in the foreground
10:53  LSD`: Tomis: not as many as people think though
10:53 +Tomis: when things can't work as they should because the OS kills programs outright when you switch to do something else
10:54 +Tomis: then yes, they need to fix that, and they did mostly with the multitasking system
10:55  LSD`: this is the kind of thing people bitch about it because they think that because one thing as it (even if it's crap at it), everythign else needs it
10:55 +Tomis: as much as i dislike it, they're bringing the same concepts to mac os x in 10.7
10:55 +Tomis: and it will probably serve to increase the battery life even further
10:55 +Tomis: most apps don't need to be sitting in the background churning away doing jack-all
10:56 +Tomis: heck, even itunes idles at more than 0% CPU
10:56 +Tomis: if i haven't touched an app in a bit, sleep it, save me some cycles
10:56 +Tomis: that's the essential idea
10:57  LSD`: That's all good and well in theory, but it turns to crap when you put it out into the hands of developers and users
10:57 +Tomis: we'll see
10:58 +Tomis: every developer thinks he's a god among men and his program needs priority above all others
10:58  torchie: what's happening?
10:58 +Tomis: and the OS is there to say no, shutup and sit down, you'll take the resources you're given and be happy
10:59 +Tomis: will be awesome to see 20 hour battery life on a mac laptop because of all of this
10:59  LSD`: ...only if developers and users can have their expectations reigned in enough to make it actually work
10:59 +Tomis: it will work
10:59 +Tomis: apps will suspend when told, an resume when told
10:59  LSD`: ...like multitasking oin iOS? :/
10:59 +Tomis: it will be seamless
10:59 +Tomis: mac os x already has unfettered multitasking
11:00 +Tomis: if they reign it in, it will only be a bonus
11:00 +Tomis: everything will run better, because there will be less wasted cycles
11:00  LSD`: unfettered multitasking works when you have virtually unlimited resources
11:00  torchie: 20 hour battery life :DDDDDDD
11:00 +Tomis: well that's how mac os x works right now
11:01  LSD`: With any luck, Apple's Mac App Store guidelines will help weed out the rubbish
11:01 +Tomis: open 20 apps, the system does not one thing to say "hey, this is crazy, lets sleep the other 10 apps you haven't touched in a while here"
11:01 +Tomis: and it really should be when you think about it
11:02 +Tomis: more fine-grained power/resource management, better battery life, better overall performance
11:02  LSD`: It'll certainly be interesting, but at the same time it's a good thing there's less to lose on notebook/desktop platforms
11:03  LSD`: worst case, it won't be any better than it is now
11:04 +Tomis: you know whati can't wait to see, leaps in e-ink
11:04  torchie: what is this shit
11:04  torchie: hi, i'm a computer! im on the internet!
11:04  torchie: oh i hear you have something mission critical to do
11:04  torchie: time to not work
11:05 +Tomis: color e-ink with usable refresh rates, much lower power draw, no need for a backlight most of the time
11:05  LSD`: Tomis: ...would be great if they can ever make a non-backlit colour display that doesn't suck
11:06 +Tomis: it'll get there one day
11:07  LSD`: colour eink, if an when they ever make it, would have the same issues as a reflective colour LCD screen, the biggest being their next to useless in the absence of direct light. Every try playing a game boy colour or first generation game boy advance?
11:07  torchie: what
11:07  Kasm279: LSD`: add a frontlight :D
11:07 +Tomis: magazines are readable without a backlight
11:07  torchie: isn't the whole point of color eink to not have the reflection in the light?
11:07 +Tomis: there's where it's going
11:07 +Tomis: that sort of quality
11:07  torchie: just like black and white eink where it's not useless in the sun
11:08  LSD`: torchie: reflective monochrome displays are fine, it's the colour ones that suck
11:08 +Tomis: the backlight will be optional, not a requirement for using he display like it is now
11:08 +Tomis: and that alone will yeild huge decreases in power draw
11:09  LSD`: (and by reflective, I mean the kind you see in calculators that use light going in and being reflected back out to work)
11:09  torchie: why don't we also
11:09  torchie: build solar panels into everything
11:09  torchie: or at least bezels
11:09  torchie: which are black and absorb much sunlight anyway

11:19  _Dave123_: what is the best way now a days to convert flac to mp3?
11:19  _Dave123_: on a mac
11:21  LSD`: I have no idea, I usually farm the job out to a Linux machine with lame on the odd occasion I need to do that. lame is probably in the major repositories for Mac, but I can't be bothered maintaining xcode on my system for that.
11:22 +Tomis: i'd probably just search macupdate for "flac aac" dave
11:22 +Tomis: as aac is a better choice than mp3
11:22  EmilioTucci: any 24hours book to learn programming for Mac & iPhone? I have a C++ backgroudn programer for many years but not time for learning now

11:24  lastn0de: what's this channel policy on ebooks?
11:24  lastn0de: as in um, torrents
11:24  LSD`: lastn0de: if they're copyright, they're verboten
11:24  LSD`: There are various perfectly legal avenues for obtaining ebooks though, Project Gutenberg, for example
11:25  lastn0de: of course
11:25  lastn0de: not that id ever download anything that was under copyright
11:30 +Tomis: the entire internet is copyright
11:31 +Tomis: also, facebook now has a trademark on the word face
11:31  lastn0de: Tomis, that's why i dont use the internet

12:31  LSD`: Aufwind: It's the main function of the tilde (~) key which is usually up next to 1 on US-layout keyboards
12:32  Aufwind: LSD`: Perhaps you do know where it is on a German keyboard?
12:32  Aufwind: I tryed several keys and the windows within an application resist to switch... :-/

16:44  Marctraider: Or elaborate.
16:44  Marctraider: I have this macbook pro i5, where i have 2 cores and 2 HT threads (so 4 threads). Now what i want to know, or want to have clarified is that in activity monitor another monitor like istat when i fully load up the processor it tells me 400% total.
16:46  Marctraider: No wait it tells me 4 threads (when running progs full load) that all 4 progs run 100%.
16:46  Marctraider: so total of 400%
16:46  Marctraider: Ok i get it already. nvm :p
16:48  js_: god, i really want to move windows around with 2 or 3 fingers without it interfering with application gestures
16:48  js_: is there any application that lets me do that?
16:49  Marctraider: Mhh.. The only thing i cannot understand is that also my HT 'virtual cores' go to 100% while using my true cores for the full 100% percent. I thought HT is only there to use some of the parts of the processor which arent doing anything atm.

23:48  msj121_: Khalid: that is so odd, I would think they would want to stop that, as it seems abusive... hmmmm
23:48  Khalid: why?
23:48  Khalid: the warranty covers the product
