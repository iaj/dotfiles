00:00  mroe: the larger the sensor the more light will hit it
00:00  LaraX: b3ny0-: what about iPhone 4
00:00  CPng|N: I'd rather have gotten a slimmer 5mp that left the phone totally flat but whatever
00:00  b3ny0-: otherwise you'll only end up with the same shitty images, only bigger
00:00  danl: b3ny0-: hence my statement on that more than mp matters
00:00  [Kevin]: I don't like how the iphone 4 saturates colors or something
00:00  b3ny0-: LaraX: I don't own one so I don't know
00:00  [Kevin]: makes everything look fake
00:00  LaraX: [Kevin]: can't you adjust that?
00:00  CPng|N: can probably desaturate with the Camera+ app
00:00  CPng|N: if not the built in app
00:01  CPng|N: also you may be tlaking about their new HDR thing
00:01  b3ny0-: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELd4n8vn-r4
00:01  CPng|N: (high dynamic range)
00:01  b3ny0-: this was recorded with a 3GS
00:01  [Kevin]: I dunno
00:01  [Kevin]: I don't use the camera on my phone very often
00:01  [Kevin]: so I don't care how good it is
00:02  b3ny0-: there's a HDR app for 3G/3GS
00:02  [Kevin]: I'm not a fan of the iphone at all
00:03  danl: Is it sad that this is my favorite book?
00:03  danl: It was printed in 1921
00:04  b3ny0-: as long as you don't say Twilight I'm cool with whatever you're reading :P
00:04  danl: I love the smell of the book
00:04  [Kevin]: I don't have a favorite book
00:04  [Kevin]: well, maybe sherlock holmes
00:04  b3ny0-: it was a long time ago since I last read a book
00:04  danl: b3ny0-: It's a collection of Edgar Allen Poe's works
00:04  b3ny0-: well those are still good books 
00:05  danl: I got it for $5 at some little bookshop in this little mountain town...
00:05  danl: It's in excellent shape :D
00:05  danl: I <3 old books
00:06  Angostura: I re-read War of the Worlds the other day.
00:06  Angostura: What a great book
00:06  danl: Almost spent $400 on bible in antique shop and I'm an athiest... was printed circa 1850s on gold leaf paper
00:06  Angostura: helps if you live in London, of course
00:07  danl: LaraX: did I tell you what I was saving for in January before the crap in Feb happened?
00:08  CPng|N: mmmm,mold
00:08  LaraX: danl: I don't think so... a baby?
00:08  danl: A very early edition (2nd I think) of Alice in Wonderland, her favorite book
00:08  LaraX: oh
00:09  b3ny0-: I mostly read books about electronics and sound nowadays
00:09  LaraX: danl: it's ok, you can spend it on something more worth it
00:09  danl: first editions of that book run anywhere from $15k to $175k
00:09  danl: :)
00:09  LaraX: wow what a waste of money
00:09  Marvolo: ha
00:09  LaraX: for a paper book!
00:09  danl: Books are totally worth it
00:09  b3ny0-: books with fictional storytelling was a long time ago
00:10  LaraX: no they're not
00:10  LaraX: just get an ebok version
00:10  LaraX: ebook*
00:11  LaraX: I only have a couple of paper books, and that's only because I haven't found the equivalent online yet
00:11  danl: lol
00:11  danl: I will never give up paper books
00:11  Angostura: Neither will I
00:11  LaraX: I hate paper/books. I want everything electronic
00:11  danl: the feel, the smell...
00:11  Angostura: paper books are a joy in themselves
00:11  danl: the act of turning the page
00:12  spline: the new macbook air looks nice
00:12  LaraX: you can turn pages electronically too
00:12  Marvolo: paper books float and burn
00:12  Marvolo: they're doubly useful
00:12  LaraX: spline: they still haven't changed the colors! I don't like it but will probably get the 11" anyway
00:12  danl: burning books...EHH!!!
00:12  Marvolo: kindles sink and melt
00:13  LaraX: and sell it when they make something I actually like
00:13  LaraX: danl: books are good for when you run out of fireplace wood, that's it
00:13  danl: LaraX: I can't be your e-friend anymore...
00:13  spline: LaraX: sucks that sales tax alone in NYC there would jack up the cost 100$ :-P
00:13  LaraX: danl: don't worry, I won't burn yours... I'll just hide them with your alcohol ;)
00:14  CPng|N: it seems pretty obvious they won't be going toward plastic laptops any longer
00:14  Angostura: LaraX: You clearly don't enjoy the greatest of pleasures - reading in the bath
00:14  danl: NOOOO
00:14  spline: well remember the Ti books? I love titanium but its really not a good material for laptops
00:14  danl: Angostura: I like reading in the pool
00:14  CPng|N: your best bet is to tape up the seems and and ports and spray paint or annodize the shell
00:14  CPng|N: how is it not a good material?
00:14  spline: anodize yeah or put some TI-Oxide coat
00:15  spline: if you have access to such equipment
00:15  LaraX: spline: I got my PowerBook G4 from a relative who worked at an Apple store in California, it still was a lot with shipping etc
00:15  CPng|N: yeah access and $ are the problem there
00:15  danl: LaraX: apple employees get shite for a discount
00:15  spline: LaraX: I just am so used to no sales tax and have had friends purchase laptops via me because of it
00:15  spline: danl: 20%? 
00:15  danl: my student discount is more than the employee discouynt
00:15  danl: *discount
00:15  danl: spline: try 7%
00:15  spline: ouch
00:15  spline: doesn't even beat the 9.75% NYC sales tax
00:16  danl: same here
00:16  danl: 7.8%
00:16  spline: lame salestax
00:16  LaraX: Angostura: I usually take showers not baths, and if it's a bath no I don't read there, maybe I can have a laptop next to me as long as I don't touch it
00:16  LaraX: and anyway the paper would get wet too from the water
00:16  spline: LaraX: yeah I don't think we need a mythbusters episode to debunk the "lets bring electronics in the bath!"
00:16  danl: haha
00:17  spline: seriously
00:17  spline: heh
00:17  danl: 1000 ways to die episode there
00:17  spline: it was cool way back when laptops dropped below 2k 
00:17  spline: and people were like, "Dude im reading my RSS feeds on the toilet!"
00:17  Angostura: LaraX: Nahh, sure the pages can get a bit damp - but just pop it on a radiator and they dry off
00:17  CPng|N: 11 inch is $950 with edu discount
00:17  LaraX: spline: well not "in", but next to the bathtub maybe, you can put it on something like the stool, or at least the toilet to listen to music
00:18  Angostura: LaraX: And how do you read? Make the font size REALLY BIG?
00:18  Angostura: :-)
00:18  LaraX: I don't know, I have other things to do in the shower/bath anyway
00:18  Angostura: LaraX: Ah, you're missing a treat
00:18  CPng|N: mmm wrinkles
00:18  LaraX: Angostura: listening to music/talk radio isn't good enough?
00:19  LaraX: or any audio, like a podcast
00:19  CPng|N: say < book.txt
00:19  Angostura: LaraX: Not if you like reading, nope
00:19  LaraX: you can read the rest of the time but ok
00:19  CPng|N: must. read. text. with. eyes.   hehe
00:20  LaraX: in the bath my head is either under the water, or at least my hands are. I don't want to be touching things that can't get wet/soapy
00:20  CPng|N: plus you should be cleaning yourself and getting the heck out
00:20  LaraX: or oily
00:21  LaraX: right
00:21  LaraX: I mean you stay for a little while and relax, not hours
00:21  Angostura: Ah, one of these people who believes that baths are functional
00:21  Angostura: Not something to enjoy, occassionally adding a bit more hot water
00:21  Angostura: until you prune :-)
00:21  LaraX: of course, there are a lot of things to do, exfoliating, shaving, etc
00:22  Angostura: Yup, and you can do that at the end, after you've relaxed with your book
00:22  LaraX: maybe using a mask
00:22 * Angostura can't believe he is arguing about this
00:22  LaraX: but your hands are still wet/soapy, you get all this on your books?
00:22  LaraX: maybe guys have less to do in there so they don't care, I don't know
00:23  Angostura: LaraX: You know what's good about books - if they get damp, they dry out. Without going "phhhzt!"
00:23  CPng|N: maybe the "guys" here aren't guys?
00:23  CPng|N: but the pages get fuxored
00:23  LaraX: Angostura: and then the pages bend and stick together? no thanks
00:23  Angostura: CPng|N: I do have quite a few 'crinkly' books, yeh
00:24  LaraX: maybe they should make books for the bath made out of plastic, then it might work
00:24  Angostura: LaraX: I'm talking about wet thumb prints - not washing the bloody thing
00:24  Angostura: LaraX: They do
00:24  LaraX: really?
00:24  Angostura: Yup - mainly for under 5s, though :-)
00:25  LaraX: 5 seconds?
00:25  Angostura: So if you want the hungry caterpillar, you're in luk
00:25  Angostura: 5 years 
00:25  danl: found a new place to eat my money
00:25  LaraX: where
00:25  danl: http://www.abebooks.com/ they have lots of old and rare books
00:25  LaraX: danl: seriously I can't believe you were going to spend all that on a book
00:25  LaraX: I understand she likes it but...
00:26  danl: The copy of the 2nd edition I found was only $500
00:26  LaraX: still!
00:26  CPng|N: only
00:26  LaraX: "only"
00:26  LaraX: lol

00:32  CPng|N: if my woman came home and said "look at this $6500 book I just bought!"
00:32  LaraX: CPng|N: they already did...
00:32  danl: Angostura: I'd prefer a first edition of this: http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=2513965729&searchurl=an%3Ddarwin%26fe%3Don%26prl%3D10.00%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D1%26sts%3Dt%26x%3D0%26y%3D0
00:32  Angostura: Nahh, too common
00:32  Angostura: The worm book was where it was
00:33  danl: lol
00:33  LaraX: but yeah I couldn't deal with someone who wasted all that money on books and not more important things
00:33  Angostura: define "Important things"
00:33  CPng|N: that's retirement stuff
00:33 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 90 seconds
00:33  danl: LaraX: I would only ever buy books that expensive if I was filthy rich
00:33  LaraX: anything but a book!
00:33  Angostura: Poor definition
00:33  CPng|N: works for me. lol
00:33  Angostura: Books changed the world
00:34  LaraX: danl: if the guy was filthy rich I guess it doesn't matter, he can spend as much as he wants on whatever he wants...
00:34  danl: The library I would have if I were rich
00:34  CPng|N: yes but buying an old $500 one won't change your world
00:34  LaraX: right
00:34  danl: would be hermetically sealed for the old books of course
00:34  CPng|N: well maybe it will in your mind. and your bank account
00:34  LaraX: how useless
00:35  Angostura: The thing is that you are holding in your hands physical objects that did change the world, and can be beautiful in their own right
00:35  LaraX: unless your home is a museum
00:35  Angostura: ... and that you can still read
00:35  Angostura: (but probably not in the bath)
00:36  LaraX: maybe I'm just not old fashioned enough or something
00:36  CPng|N: I think that's our "problem"
00:36  LaraX: the only good thing about older things sometimes is they're made better
00:36  CPng|N: then again you want an old style macbook not a nice new aluminum one
00:36  Angostura: I'm not sure whether "old fashioned" equates to "has a feel for history"
00:36  CPng|N: it does
00:37  CPng|N: ~= maybe
00:37  CPng|N: heh
00:37  CPng|N: ±10%
00:37  danl: cheapest signed copy of Stranger in a Strange land that they have: http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1331864811&searchurl=prl%3D10.00%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sgnd%3Don%26sortby%3D17%26tn%3Dstranger%2Bin%2Ba%2Bstrange%2Bland%26x%3D84%26y%3D13
00:37  LaraX: Angostura: I can learn about history from wikipedia and documentaries, I don't need to "own" any of these things
00:37  LaraX: you can still appreciate things in other ways
00:37  Angostura: LaraX: And you never need to see a tiger in the flesh because Wikipedia has a photo
00:38  CPng|N: this is true
00:38  LaraX: Angostura: seeing/experiencing something isn't the same as owning/collecting it, in your home
00:38  Angostura: ... or look at a sunset or gaze at the might sky to see the milkyway
00:38  LaraX: I can see a tiger irl without owning it as a pet
00:38  CPng|N: me ow
00:39  LaraX: we can own 10.7 Tiger in our home though
00:39  Angostura: LaraX: Oh - so it is the ownership issue?
00:39 * staticsafe just reinstalled OSX
00:39  staticsafe: :D
00:39  Angostura: Most of my books come from the library - for free
00:40  staticsafe: How long does a combined update usually take? O_O
00:40  LaraX: Angostura: yeah and the not liking to collect junk, I do too much of it already and need to always get rid of stuff and make sure junk doesn't accumulate, and books are one of those totally useless things that create clutter to me (as long as I can find the equivalent electronically)
00:40  staticsafe: it's updating to 10.6.4
00:41  CPng|N: keep waiting staticsafe
00:41  LaraX: Angostura: I don't collect/own music or movies either
00:41  staticsafe: CPng|N: i will, it's writing files now
00:41  staticsafe: :D
00:41  CPng|N: sorry you felt the need to reinstall
00:41  danl: Angostura: http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=3523470843&searchurl=bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26pn%3DPenguin%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D2%26tn%3DWhat%2BHitler%2BWants%26x%3D69%26y%3D15 :)
00:41  Angostura: Whereas the wife and I like the living room with wall-to-wall filled bookcases
00:41  CPng|N: you normally have to really F up to need to reinstall OS X or *nix
00:41  danl: I know you are man who would love penguin circa ww2
00:41  LaraX: Angostura: I'm a minimalist in that way, but I know some people like collecting things
00:41  staticsafe: CPng|N: actually it was my own damned fault, wiped the wrong partition in disk utility
00:42  CPng|N: lol
00:42  CPng|N: sorry
00:42  staticsafe: thank god for backups
00:42  staticsafe: :D
00:42  CPng|N: but damn, that's a pricey mistake
00:42  CPng|N: yeah really
00:42  LaraX: my only "collection" is of Sanrio stuff, and other cute things, but want to get rid of a lot of that too and have if they're not useful
00:42  staticsafe: CPng|N: i didn't have any critical stuff
00:42  staticsafe: so it's good
00:42  CPng|N: LaraX:  next step is removing marketing labels from fine things like new cars
00:43  spline: minimalism > *
00:43  LaraX: CPng|N: I remove labels that aren't useful/ugly too
00:43  staticsafe: but it's gonna be a pain to reinstall apps and set it up properly again :D
00:43  spline: heh like labels on pillows and mattresses 
00:43  LaraX: spline: yeah, I try
00:43  staticsafe: can't wait to get my hands on iLife '11 :D
00:43  CPng|N: my next car I'm ordering sans-labels evn if I have to wait, or I'm remoing with a heat guy on day 1
00:44  CPng|N: removing with a heat gun
00:44  LaraX: no more like price stickers on something I'm going to keep for a long time, or I don't know
00:44  CPng|N: i kan tipe
00:44  CPng|N: or those damn feature labels on new monitors and dvd players tha tpeople leave on
00:44  danl: bedtime before work
00:44  danl: talk to you guys later
00:44  LaraX: bye danl
00:45  Bensawsome: wow
00:45  Bensawsome: wtf is wrong with apple
00:45  LaraX: spline: I always ask myself if something is both beautiful + practical, if it's not I don't want it
00:45  staticsafe: damn, my MBP is hot atm
00:45  spline: LaraX: amen
00:45  LaraX: :)
00:46  LaraX: spline: but that makes me extremely picky too, which gets on some peoples' nerves. oh well
00:46  Bensawsome: staticsafe lol thats how most of em are... unless they're off xD
00:46  spline: LaraX: yeah, same problem around gift time
00:46  staticsafe: Bensawsome: nah mostly it's pretty cool, but when the components are used at max for a while they get hot
00:46  spline: LaraX: but that works well when you're on 5th avenue there
00:47  spline: LaraX: they do cater best to discriminate tastes, even if not just disposed towards "expensive"
00:47  spline: but sometimes not easy to bifurcate 
00:47  LaraX: spline: yeah, and you can't go wrong with gift cards though there isn't much thought/meaning behind it
00:47  spline: heh yeah the "25$ borders/bn gift card" is like your savior for that
00:47  spline: everyone can usually find something there
00:47  LaraX: spline: it's not about expensive, it's about quality, and I'd rather have nothing at all than something I don't like
00:48  LaraX: that's why I wait forever
00:48  CPng|N: and cash than a card for 1 specific place
00:48  staticsafe: yay
00:48  spline: LaraX: that's why I do custom jewelry and have a few artisans depending on the product
00:48  staticsafe: update is done
00:48  CPng|N: and he's up to date!
00:48 * staticsafe installs Office 2011
00:48  CPng|N: onoz
00:48  staticsafe: lol
00:48  CPng|N: don't ruin that fresh new install with MS!
00:48  Bensawsome: god damnit
00:48  staticsafe: should i install iWork instead CPng|N?
00:49  CPng|N: probably
00:49  Bensawsome: why did apple do that to os 10.7?!
00:49  staticsafe: lol
00:49  CPng|N: depends on if you need it for work compatability really
00:49  CPng|N: Bensawsome:  what, update Spaces?
00:49  CPng|N: heh
00:49  LaraX: spline: you wear jewelry?
00:49  Bensawsome: CPng|N make 10.7 into iOS
00:49  Bensawsome: i mean
00:49  CPng|N: that's all it looked like to me. more tweaking of the exposé/Spaces stuff
00:49  Bensawsome: im done with apple now
00:49  CPng|N: they've hardly done that
00:49  Bensawsome: lol
00:50  spline: LaraX: no when I've had it done. I have a necklace I had made out of titanium+pure Ti chain 
00:50  CPng|N: there's an app store that I doublt you HAVE to use (if you do they're seriously f'd), and some silly launcher that is the sae as the stacks but fulscreen
00:50  Angostura: Bensawsome: Prone to hyperbole, much?
00:51  LaraX: spline: do you have a pic of it? I don't wear much jewelry, I haven't really looked into or decided what I like but I know I don't want to deal with polishing silver and I like small jewelry
00:51  staticsafe: o lord
00:51  staticsafe: more updates
00:51  LaraX: and I don't want blood diamonds either
00:51  spline: yeah I learned how to polish ti
00:52  spline: use a Dremel setup I have on my workbench 
00:52  spline: LaraX: -g
00:52  LaraX: I'm looking for a metal that's some shade between silver and gold, is there a precious metal like that?
00:52  LaraX: ok

01:00  LaraX: spline: no I mean within the facets of the beads or something it's shinier (they're not round beads)
01:00  spline: I know you can use a tumbler that can shine things that lack straight edges
01:01  spline: I have to use some very tiny bits when I've repolished my watch (pure Ti) esp. around the links
01:01  LaraX: yeah but the whole point of this is they have facets so they'll be shinier
01:01  spline: that's what I know if you are using beads or surfaces where its not a geometric shape
01:01  spline: because normally people are using some type of wheel on a drum or Dremel-like tool where you can get in
01:01  LaraX: it is geometric, it's not a random shape
01:02  LaraX: yeah I know about tumblers
01:02  spline: and you polish using a Dremel or by hand?
01:02  spline: 2000-grit can work for that to start but also depends on the surface
01:02  spline: and you usually can get someof that mailorder
01:02  LaraX: what? I'm talking about crystal eads right now, not metals
01:02  LaraX: b
01:02  spline: ho 
01:02  spline: Er ohh
01:02  spline: I assume crystal is polished using a similar cloth-based wheel then?
01:02  spline: I've never done that beyond touching sapphire 
01:03  CPng|N: staticsafe:  not sure on it's compatability. I'm sure it can open basic documents but i fyou have fancier things you have to edit, it might be an issue
01:03  LaraX: I have no idea, it doesn't need to be polished
01:03  spline: re sapphire-based crystal that you'd find on a watch
01:03  CPng|N: but it's much more mac-like than office. at least the previous office
01:03  CPng|N: as far as interface and keyboard shortcuts
01:03  staticsafe: Office 2011 is really nice
01:03  spline: LaraX: if you find a custom artisan, they are normally quite happy to talk about the craft. I found out via mine
01:03  LaraX: it's like glass, on my wrist, gets cleaned when I'm washing my hands or in the shower
01:04  LaraX: the problem is not knowing what to restring it with and what kind of clasp to use (or not use one) so the string is transparent and doesn't break again so I don't lose beads
01:05  LaraX: it didn't used to have a clasp, was just stretchy, and I prefer it that way
01:05  spline: not pure, right? must be some polymer 
01:06  LaraX: I don't know what it used to be strung with but I found some transparent Japanese stretchy string for it, it should be good. but still don't know about the clasp/how to close it part
01:06  LaraX: maybe I should get a jeweler to do it
01:07  spline: what does it look like?
01:07  [Kevin]: my printer says it's not connected to my macbook when I try to scan something, but it prints things from the macbook
01:08  spline: LaraX: the first time I got a watch that wasn't a 30$ ironman with links, I used one of those Kiosks in the mall to do the links.. and that was the last. They screwed the dowel up and I nearly lost the watch when it flew off my hand. Thankfully, it was under warranty and the company had no problem swapping it out + using my wrist diameter to adjust it prior to shipping
01:15  LaraX: brb

01:56  Angostura: could CPng|N be on to something, I wonder?
01:58  MrUnagi: could be
02:02  staticsafe: CPng|N: linux uses CUPS, OSX uses CUPS it's all good

02:09  winegoddess: hi all. setting up my dev env on my new mac pro. scary stuff coming from PC. its al new
02:11  Tomis: welcoem to mac! might be better to pose dev relation questions to the dev rooms
02:11  winegoddess: Thanks Tomis. I was just saying hi. Are there any other Mac channels for dev?
02:12  staticsafe: winegoddess: welcome to the awesome world of OSX!
02:12  staticsafe: also winegoddess what do you develop?
02:12  Tomis: there's objc and cocoa oriented channels
02:12  winegoddess: Tomis - oh, im not that far along yet.
02:12  winegoddess: staticsafe:  java, php, mysql. trying to setup MAMP now.
02:12  staticsafe: ah
02:13  staticsafe: nice
02:13  winegoddess: i miss my mouse right now :)

02:34  LaraX: CPng|N: actually, my internet was so bad recently I switched to Chrome and made it my default browser because there was no WAY Firefox would've worked with that speed, though pages didn't load in Chrome either. I was forcing myself to get used to Chrome's Find
02:36  LaraX: CPng|N: it's not as bad as I thought since it shows the word instances marked in the scrollbar but still not the same
02:36  LaraX: at least in the beta it does
02:41  LaraX: danl: poke
02:42  LaraX: danl: are you saying MobileMe doesn't sync well with your Google account? because I wanted to do that like for contacts and calendar
02:44 --- joekv is now known as aru
02:44  winegoddess: LaraX - curious - i dont use mobileme but can still synch with google
02:44  LaraX: winegoddess: sync what with google then?
02:45  winegoddess: both my calendar and contacts
02:45  winegoddess: iCal - preferences -> accounts
02:46  winegoddess: same thing for address book
02:46  LaraX: winegoddess: and I see you're new to Macs, welcome :)
02:46  winegoddess: yes!!! very new. im taking the onetoone clases trying to play catchup
02:46  LaraX: dev channels like #macdev , #macosxdev , also #iphonedev , #ipaddev (not sure if it's # or ##)
02:46  winegoddess: i havent gotten mobileme yet - i use dropbox and havent seen a reason to switch
02:46  EdLin: hi
02:47  LaraX: hi EdLin
02:47  EdLin: LaraX: so, what do you think of the new MBA and Lion?
02:49  LaraX: EdLin: I need to watch the video again, couldn't watch it streaming on Apple's site from a PC and the volume in the stream on http://live.gizmodo.com/ was too low
02:49  EdLin: LaraX: I only saw a summery, not the full-strength reality distortion field. ;-)
02:49  FriedBob: danl: Still around?
02:49  LaraX: EdLin: I don't like that they still haven't changed the colors of the MacBook Air but will probably just get the 11" anyway then sell it when they make something I actually like... because I need something!
02:50  LaraX: FriedBob: I think he's at work or going to
02:50  LaraX: EdLin: I like how the Apple TV is all black
02:50  Sebboh: Hi all.  I'm thinking about purchasing a used Mac Mini.  It's a PowerMac10,1.  It has OSX 10.3.  I'd like to run a more recent OSX.  What are my options, and what will an upgrade cost?  Is there any free upgrade available for this machine?
02:50  FriedBob: LaraX: Danke
02:50  EdLin: LaraX: yeah, a black macbook would be great.
02:51  LaraX: FriedBob: you're welcome
02:51  FriedBob: EdLin: Almost everything is better in black.
02:51  LaraX: EdLin: yeah all black or some other color
02:51  LaraX: I guess they're not changing the designs yet
02:52  jeffmr: Sebboh, can you give a link to the specs?
02:52  LaraX: it almost looks white here: http://edge-cache.gizmodo.com/gizmodo/apple1020/1020_71.jpg
02:52  LaraX: is it really that light? :|
02:53  jeffmr: Its like regular mbpros
02:53  jeffmr: still silver
02:54  LaraX: jeffmr: I know and I hate it. I like it besides that
02:55  LaraX: it looks like a kitchen appliance I wouldn't buy
02:55  jeffmr: you hate silver?
02:55  jeffmr: ?
02:55  LaraX: not all shades but when it's that light/matte and contrasted with black in that way yeah
02:55  jeffmr: It looks like everything else they've made
02:55  jeffmr: I think that's just the photo
02:55  LaraX: yes I know, which is why I haven't bought any of it...
02:56  LaraX: and have been waiting
02:56  jeffmr: what mac did you have?
02:56  LaraX: PowerBook G4, not that I liked that matte silver either but at least all silver wasn't as jarring
02:56  FriedBob: I <3 my PBG4.
02:57  LaraX: the 12" would've been nicer
02:57  FriedBob: that's what I have.
02:57  jeffmr: you mean you don't like that the keyboard is black?
02:57  LaraX: those are ok
02:57  FriedBob: It's what I am IRCing from now, actually.
02:58  LaraX: jeffmr: I don't like that much of a contrast and the way the colors are balanced, it's almost black + white in that pic, but even in other pics it's still like that
02:58  LaraX: also it looks too masculine
02:58  FriedBob: lol
02:58  LaraX: the colors like that
02:58  LaraX: whatever, I need to get it anyway
02:58  jeffmr: It was nice when they came out with the candy colored imacs
02:59  LaraX: jeffmr: yes I loved those! and wish I bought one in time. by the time I switched to PCs they were discontinued
02:59  jeffmr: its not too late, if you are nostalgic
02:59  LaraX: I love the colors/translucent/plastic look, or at least the black MacBooks that came out later
03:00  jeffmr: yeah
03:00  LaraX: they're too old to get now
03:00  jeffmr: they started making the metal silver with the iraq war when they shipped all those desktops to the middle east
03:00  LaraX: really?
03:00  jeffmr: I think so
03:00  jeffmr: the mac pro came out about then
03:01  LaraX: they sent the colored ones to Iraq?
03:01  jeffmr: and I think it was kind of a pr move on apple's part to appeal to a large part of the public
03:01  LaraX: the colors might cheer the soldiers up :)
03:01  jeffmr: this is just a guess, maybe they came out with the silver before that
03:01  jeffmr: lol
03:01  jeffmr: anything would help
03:01  jeffmr: send them flowers
03:01  LaraX: yeah
03:01  jeffmr: tell them to go home
03:02  jeffmr: that's what's caused all the damage to the us now
03:02  jeffmr: if we had never went...
03:02  tanner: i hope Apple does to the MBP what it did to the MBA
03:03  jeffmr: it will
03:03  jeffmr: he said in the keynote that that was the future of laptops
03:03  S_SubZero: throw in an anemic processor and a massive bezel?
03:03  jeffmr: I believe it
03:04  koro: Oh noes!
03:04  koro: Apple did it again!
03:04  koro: They invented full-screen technology...
03:04  jeffmr: hey
03:04  koro: it's still in beta-testing but it will be available in OS X 10.7 lion
03:04  jeffmr: if it feels good
03:05  tanner: im excited for 10.7
03:05  tanner: mission control is pure sex
03:05  koro: But man, fullscreen... just wow.
03:05  tanner: get over it koro 
03:05  jeffmr: I thought you were joking
03:06  jeffmr: adobe's had full screen for I don't know how long
03:06  tanner: the 11" mba has a higher resolution screen than my fucking 13" mbp
03:06  koro: get over it tanner 
03:06  tanner: so, with any luck, the entire mbp lineup will get higher resolution screens next refresh
03:07  jeffmr: I like the one click install for apps
03:07  tanner: take out the optical drive and stuff a battery in there
03:07  jeffmr: that's the next thing
03:07  jeffmr: somone came up with ssd for hard drives
03:07  koro: jeffmr: i approve 
03:07  jeffmr: now someone has to come up with the next best thing for batteries
03:07  koro: -optical +battery yea
03:08  koro: that could get me 2-3 extra hours
03:08  torchie: 2-3?
03:08  torchie: don't
03:08  jeffmr: they need to make them a lot smaller
03:08  torchie: be afraid
03:08  torchie: to dream a little bigger
03:08  torchie: darling.
03:08  CPng|N: ahhh
03:08  torchie: 24 hour battery life.
03:08  CPng|N: I'm not a big baseball fan, but there's nothing like walking around the corner and watching the game with a dozen coworkers on a 70" screen drinking some 9% homebrewed ale
03:08  jeffmr: as far as I can tell, the only thing that keeps the mba from being thinner are the ports
03:08  koro: torchie: enter key != spacebar
03:08  torchie: yeah that's why I used them both
03:09  torchie: (darling)
03:09  CPng|N: lol
03:09  tanner: i'm completely fine with the size of the current MBP's if they just took out the optical drive, made the logic board smaller and filled the additional space with batteries
03:09  torchie: so much batteries
03:09  koro: tanner: either that, or just take out the drive and make it a little bit smaller
03:09  koro: no need to be ultra-thin
03:09  jeffmr: everything is going to be thin
03:09  koro: just don't waste room with that stupid optical drive thing
03:09  tanner: yeah; i care more about battery life than i do how thick it is
03:09  koro: only grannies use it
03:10  jeffmr: eventually it will just be a hologram
03:10  jeffmr: there will be no hardware
03:10  Marvolo: or if they encapsulated the processor in a vacuum and did away with the need for cooling fans
03:10  Marvolo: ahh crazy thinking
03:10  koro: tanner: i heard you care how thick it is
03:10  koro: Marvolo: that wouldn't be good enough
03:11  tanner: your homophobic jokes don't phase me koro :)
03:11  koro: how's that homophibic
03:11  koro: for all i know you could be a woman
03:11  jeffmr: tanner?
03:11  jeffmr: not likely a woman's name
03:12  koro: the internets never lie, rite?
03:12  jeffmr: he doesn't have much of a reason to
03:12  koro: sigh
03:12  koro: that's irrelevant
03:13  koro: i didn't say he's a woman, or even that i think he's a woman
03:13  jeffmr: I know
03:13  koro: I do think tho that they should get rid of fans.
03:13  jeffmr: I was just referring to your remark about his name
03:13  koro: I hate moving parts.
03:13  torchie: fans are dead
03:13  koro: Optical drive, fan, gtfo.
03:13  torchie: yeah
03:13  torchie: I bet the new mbas last a million years
03:13  koro: even hard drive, gtf!!!
03:13  koro: o
03:13  torchie: or at least until they hit the read/write issue :(
03:14  jeffmr: lol
03:14  LaraX: EdLin: what did you think of the video? getting anything?
03:14  jeffmr: what's ucf torchie?
03:14  tanner: you need the fans
03:15  tanner: unless you want your balls to be the heatsink
03:15  torchie: university of central florida
03:15  jeffmr: lol
03:15  tanner: you have to cool the device down somehow
03:15  koro: tanner: they have to figure out a more efficient/quiet cooling mechanism
03:15  jeffmr: thanks tanner
03:15  EdLin: LaraX: I haven't seen it yet, was just busy with my roommate's computer. It's turning off its antivirus and acting slow, chances are, it's got malware. :(
03:15  torchie: if they could just
03:15  torchie: make everything arm
03:15  tanner: jeffmr: for?
03:15  koro: either that or find a way to generate less heat
03:15  torchie: done!
03:15  jeffmr: the laugh
03:16  tanner: ah
03:16  tanner: anytime
03:16  tanner: seriously though, you cant find a smaller method of cooling your device down than a fan
03:16  koro: i recall like 20 years ago, people talked about "optical computers" and how they would revolutionize everything
03:16  koro: where are teh goddamn optical computers
03:16  koro: no heat!
03:16  torchie: the smaller method?
03:16  torchie: arm processors
03:16  torchie: :D
03:16  tanner: ARM isn't a desktop class processor
03:16  jeffmr: what do they call it, convection heat dissipation or something
03:16  tanner: never will be
03:16  jeffmr: soc
03:17  torchie: desktops
03:17  torchie: maaaaan
03:17  torchie: desktops?
03:17  jeffmr: convection cooling
03:17  koro: what
03:17  tanner: desktop/laptop/server
03:17  torchie: laptops
03:17  torchie: maaaaaan
03:17  torchie: laptops?
03:17  LaraX: EdLin: if he's using a PC maybe he should try Spyware Doctor with Anti-Virus from https://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html , I've been using it since I've been on a PC and it's been pretty good I think
03:17  torchie: at the end of the day they still need a desk
03:17  koro: jeffmr: what do you mean? that's the usual method of dissipation
03:17  jeffmr: until the fan kicks in
03:17  CPng|N: Kaspersky
03:18  torchie: and maaaaan
03:18  torchie: desks?
03:18  jeffmr: some desktops are just convection, with no fans
03:18  torchie: do you think there will be desks when everyone is dead
03:18  koro: oh, yeah because they have room to spare
03:18  jeffmr: they'll make chips cool enough eventually
03:18  koro: that's totally impossible in a notebook unless you want to give up processing power
03:18  CPng|N: no modern CPU works without a fan or other type of cooling. unless you have one of those ridiculous large heatsinks on it and don't do too much heavy work
03:18  jeffmr: they fit c2d in 1 inch laptops with a small fan, they'll eventually make them go away
03:18  EdLin: LaraX: it's using Microsoft Security Essentials, antiviruses all are imperfect actually.... All they can do is detect malware about a third of the time, and then your computer is already screwed.
03:18  torchie: no one man should have all that power
03:19  koro: no, i think it's more likely that they develop a better cooling than processors that generate less heat in the short term
03:19  torchie: maaaaaaan
03:19  jeffmr: processors always put out less heat as they develop them
03:19  jeffmr: that's one of their goals
03:19  LaraX: EdLin: this has been removing it and even removed a trojan on another PC I used it on
03:19  tanner: the faster the processor is, the more energy it uses, the more heat it generates
03:19  tanner: that will always remain true
03:19  jeffmr: less heat, less power consumption, more power
03:20  S_SubZero: "faster" being represented how
03:20  jeffmr: I don't think that's true tanner
03:20  torchie: more jiggahertz
03:20  jeffmr: look at the heatsinks they used to use in desktops
03:20  EdLin: LaraX: OK, maybe I'll try it, but it's probably a waste of time. He also had a drive-by download, he'd been cruising lyrics sites and probably has multiple infections.
03:20  LaraX: EdLin: I don't know much about it though but it was part of Google Pack which I was getting anyway and was free so I tried it
03:21  tanner: jeffmr: it is. from idle, the faster the processor works the more energy it requires
03:21  torchie: last time I checked, intel xeon runs a hell of a lot cooler than vacuum tools
03:21  EdLin: LaraX: yep, MSE is free too....
03:21  torchie: tubes*
03:21  EdLin: LaraX: the best antiviruses are all free, because they all suck. ;-)
03:21  Tu13es: what
03:21  jeffmr: whatever
03:21  jeffmr: you guys are a part of the party of no gtfo
03:21  S_SubZero: tanner: true/false:  A Core 2 Duo 2ghz processor generates more heat than a Pentium 4 3Ghz processor
03:21  tanner: jeffmr: they can get the power consumption while idle down
03:22  LaraX: the only thing I didn't get from Google Pack is RealPlayer
03:22  LaraX: but I might uninstall some of the other things
03:22  EdLin: LaraX: yeah, realplayer is awful.
03:22  tanner: S_SubZero: you're not listening to what i am saying
03:22  LaraX: EdLin: yeah I hate it, I love Winamp
03:22  torchie: woo winamp!
03:22  torchie: it whips the llama's ass?
03:22  jeffmr: blah blah blah
03:22  torchie: or was it kicks
03:22  torchie: beats?
03:22  EdLin: LaraX: realplayer needs to go back to the mid-nineties computing hell it came from. ;-)
03:22  LaraX: EdLin: but you need it to hear certain files right?
03:22  tanner: from *idle*, the faster a processor has to work the more energy it requires and the more heat it generates
03:22  torchie: does winamp still have that classic skin
03:22  EdLin: LaraX: not on any sane website, no.
03:23  tanner: each revision of the chip may use less power at idle, but the rule still applies
03:23  torchie: sometimes you need to go to an insane website
03:23  LaraX: torchie: whips :) you like it too? it's the only thing I missed about PCs when I switched to Macs
03:23  jeffmr: what about the first computer
03:23  jeffmr: the eneac
03:23  torchie: LaraX: I missed mspaint
03:23  jeffmr: it took up a whole room with fans
03:23  jeffmr: then there was intel
03:23  torchie: also foobar2000
03:23  torchie: there's like
03:23  EdLin: LaraX: you like whips? Kinky. ;-)
03:23  torchie: no alternative to itunes
03:23  torchie: it's bizarre
03:23  LaraX: EdLin: I know but not all web designers are sane I guess :)
03:23  EdLin: LaraX: you can say that again. ;-)
03:23  LaraX: EdLin: no, we're talking about Winamp and llamas lol
03:24  EdLin: LaraX: llamas?
03:24  LaraX: EdLin: "Winamp really whips the llamas ass"
03:24  jeffmr: silence
03:24  LaraX: or something
03:24  EdLin: LaraX: llamas don't react kindly to whips, they just spit back.
03:24  LaraX: I didn't make this up lol
03:25  LaraX: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp
03:26  LaraX: "The installer for Version 1.91, released 18 days later, included wave, cdda, and Windows tray handling plugins, as well as the famous Wesley Willis-inspired DEMO.MP3 file "Winamp, it really whips the llama's ass"."
03:28  LaraX: torchie: yeah it has the Classic skin but it's ugly, I'm using the Modern skin in MonoDark (black)
03:28  torchie: it's ugly in a good way!
03:28  torchie: it's classical :D
03:28  LaraX: yeah right
03:29  LaraX: torchie: if you miss mspaint have you tried http://www.canvaspaint.org/ ?
03:29  torchie: well right now I use paintbrush
03:30  LaraX: this is like the web based version of the same thing
03:30  torchie: web?
03:30  torchie: w
03:30  torchie: ha
03:30  torchie: t
03:30  LaraX: I'm thinking of trying picnik
03:30  LaraX: did you see the link?
03:30  torchie: whoa 
03:30  torchie: nutsy
03:30  LaraX: see
03:33  winegoddess: so, bein a n00b, how do i set up localhost to specify hostnames? seems its different between Tiger and Leopard - guess i need to figure out what kind of animal I have.. :)
03:33  LaraX: winegoddess: did you just buy this computer?
03:34  LaraX: it would be Snow Leopard, do you know the OS number?
03:34  winegoddess: a week ago
03:34  winegoddess: 10.6.3
03:35  LaraX: yeah that's Snow Leopard
03:35  jeffmr: winegoddess
03:35  jeffmr: you don't have to do anything
03:35  jeffmr: just think what you want and it will produce
03:36  winegoddess: hi jeffmr - i am runnign apache and have virtual hosts - haha - just manifest it? i like that!
03:36  jeffmr: just like in hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy when she orders that tea
03:37  jeffmr: I haven't used apache in a while
03:37  jeffmr: I can't help
03:38  jeffmr: its unix though
03:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
03:38  winegoddess: no worries - now that i know i have a leopard i can gtfi
03:38  jeffmr: so whatever you would do in bsd or linux is probably pretty much the same
03:38  winegoddess: i havent figured out how to run command lines yet :)
03:39  jeffmr: terminal
03:39  jeffmr: applications - utilities - terminal
03:40  LaraX: spline: why do you like titanium for jewelry and is that pic of you?
03:40  jeffmr: winegoddess, http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20010423075959611
03:41  LaraX: winegoddess: you have Snow Leopard not Leopard, they're different :)
03:41  jeffmr: that may be a little bit old
03:41  winegoddess: whoa, LaraX - the titanium comment - for me? spline?
03:41  winegoddess: sorry im still figuring things out
03:42  winegoddess: jeffmr: i found thisone http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/05/16/supercharge-mamp/
03:42  LaraX: winegoddess: no, I wrote spline's nick at the beginning of the sentence so it's directed to him, and it's ok
03:42  spline: LaraX: rare and hard to work with, going back to what you said about the uniqueness
03:42  spline: winegoddess: what are you looking for on the command line?
03:42  winegoddess: LaraX - okay i scrolled up but didnt see a "spline" 
03:42  winegoddess: spline - you make titanium jewlery????
03:43  jeffmr: or you can edit /etc/hosts
03:43  LaraX: winegoddess: it's ok, I know what it's like to be new :) no, we were talking about jewelry earlier and I had to go
03:43  winegoddess: my fiance made my engagement ring out of Ti
03:43  spline: winegoddess: no I have it made for me.. but its not easy to find people with the equipment to work with it (and not outsourced)
03:43  winegoddess: spline - comand line just to know how to execute commands. reading pages it says to use commands like mkdir so i just made the drectory thru finder, but i might need to run scripts
03:44  spline: it is more common now
03:44  spline: winegoddess: you fire up Terminal.. I wouldn't recommend doing all the command line stuff without doing some reading
03:44  jeffmr: oh virtual hosts
03:44  spline: if you need to setup apache on the mac, using the "MAMP" package is usually the easiest
03:44  Tu13es: anyone else getting call failed etc with FaceTime on the mac?
03:44  winegoddess: jeffmr yeah - i do webdev and am setting up my environment on my mac
03:44  spline: the MAMP stuff, from folks I know who use it, say it works really well
03:45  spline: you could also use some Finder scripts (applescript) to help out with making dirs. and such
03:45  winegoddess: i have setup MAMP but still need to specify my virtual hosts somehow. i think i kinda got it, i followed the instructions so far, just not sure what i need to do with snow leopard
03:45  winegoddess: im creating a file now and will test
03:45  winegoddess: btw - you all seem very nice and i am sending you all good vibes for what you are working on
03:45  spline: winegoddess: yeah with the virtualhosts, its gonna do the editing of httpd.conf
03:46  spline: the nice thing is that all the apache stuff is specific to apache so you could pull open a blog/wiki/help page from somewhere else. Outside of the MAMP
03:46  jeffmr: I'm an aquarius
03:46  spline: I only know of "VirtualHostX" that.. I think Tyler Hall makes
03:46  spline: let me find a URL
03:46  winegoddess: Im a Gemini
03:46  spline: winegoddess: http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/ <- check that
03:46  spline: jeffmr: amen on that. I am also
03:46  spline: acq > *  :-D
03:46  jeffmr: waater
03:46  jeffmr: lol
03:47  spline: im dead-on to a type-II (feb 2->feb 9th)
03:47  spline: and get along with acq very well
03:47  winegoddess: oooh spline - that looks promising - i will check it out as soon as i try this
03:48  spline: winegoddess: it's a paid app but perfect for what you're doing if MAMP/XAMP doesn't fulfill what you need
03:48  winegoddess: i really like aquarius's )
03:48  spline: winegoddess: the rest of the "apps" I know to do any of this are incomplete/not good for someone who doesn't know the commands/cli so well
03:48  jeffmr: I like everyone
03:48  winegoddess: i used to know unix fairly well, ten years ago
03:49  winegoddess: jeffmr:  good one. i get along well with aquarius. virgo relationships tend to end badly
03:49  winegoddess: but i like all
03:49  spline: winegoddess: some people don't get us
03:49  spline: or hate the stoic stuff
03:50  jeffmr: what's characteristic of gemini?
03:50  LaraX: winegoddess: really? I love Virgos...
03:50  winegoddess: split personalities :)
03:50  LaraX: <-Capricorn
03:50  winegoddess: i like Virgos too, many of my exes are vrigos
03:50  LaraX: mine too
03:51  winegoddess: but im a techie gemini, so i can talk logically to virgos, at times
03:51  LaraX: well not many, but I was in love twice, one was a Taurus and the other a Virgo, so... :)
03:51  winegoddess: gemini - balanced, easy-going, curious, adventurous
03:51  jeffmr: what's your husband?
03:51  winegoddess: ah, i had a taurus once....
03:52  EdLin: how do you convert an .iso file so Disk Utility will burn it?
03:52  winegoddess: larax - what are chars of capricorn?
03:52  EdLin: I'm A Virgo.
03:52  jeffmr: I think just mount and burn
03:52  spline: EdLin: just load the iso. it'll burn the image to joilet on the cdrom
03:53  jeffmr: where are you spline?
03:53  EdLin: spline: I loaded it, so what next? Disk Utility wouldn't touch it.
03:53  MrUnagi: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11593375
03:53  MrUnagi: carrillo was my friend
03:53  spline: where am I?
03:53  LaraX: winegoddess: I don't know enough of them to list them, but also astrology isn't just about your sun sign, so you can't just got by that. for example I'm a Capricorn (sun), Pisces moon, Virgo rising...
03:53  spline: EdLin: open with diskutil. right click?
03:53  jeffmr: in the world
03:53  spline: ah nh
03:53  winegoddess: how do i create a file once i create a directory (in FInder?)
03:54  spline: winegoddess: 10.6 doesn't offer a way really
03:54  winegoddess: ick
03:54  spline: without using a 10.6 service or an app
03:54  jeffmr: open text edit save to folder
03:54  spline: you can cmd+shift+n = new dir
03:54  spline: yeah
03:54  winegoddess: just need a text file with .conf extension
03:54  spline: or touch under unix
03:54  spline: vim
03:54  spline: cd ~/Desktop/dir;touch newfile;
03:54  jeffmr: pico
03:55  jeffmr: probably more than touch
03:55  LaraX: spline: sorry I'm not sure if you told me, was that pic of you and why do you like titanium jewelry? I don't know much about this
03:55  winegoddess: MrUnagi: im sorry for your loss
03:55  MrUnagi: thanks
03:55  MrUnagi: sadly that article gave no more info than i already knew other than it was premeditated
03:55  spline: LaraX: yes it was and because its rare/hard to work with so its not common/cheap/generic
03:55  MrUnagi: which i had been told he was caught in the middle of another argument
03:56  spline: LaraX: it enables the same problem you mentioned before about being picky when someone buys you a gift and can't opt-out for just going the gift card route
03:56  EdLin: OK, it's working now.
03:56  spline: EdLin: yeah an ISO should be fine. its an iso9660 or joilet FS
03:56  EdLin: dunno why Disk Utility is not more intuitive.
03:56  winegoddess: spline um, so sorry i am not having luck with my irc client. what was it you said about runnign commands? how can i do that in 10.6?
03:56  spline: so you can burn on a mac w/o a problem
03:56  LaraX: spline: so you just like it because it's rare/hard to work with, not because of how it looks or anything? or it's supposed to be good for people allergic to some other metal?
03:56  spline: winegoddess: open up /Applications/Utilities/Terminal - that's your UNIX terminal on the Mac
03:56  winegoddess: ah! thank you
03:56  winegoddess: :)
03:57  spline: LaraX: it is hypoallergenic but im also not allergic. I love the look because its simple, minimal, strength:weight ratio is there
03:57  LaraX: winegoddess: what IRC client are you using? spline and I would suggest Textual
03:57  winegoddess: i like it because the atomic number is 22 :)
03:57  spline: LaraX: if my necklace was done in steel/aluminum, it'd cost $50 with labor. I shelled out the extra amount because Dan, my favorite "smith" I work with on my little ideas, is an expert
03:57  spline: haha
03:57  spline: yes we would
03:58  LaraX: lol
03:58 * LaraX is talking for spline now :p
03:58  FriedBob: I would suggest macirssi, for an OSX IRC client.
03:58  spline: LaraX: www.mrtitanium.com - he does great earrings 
03:58  spline: your IRC clients on OSX: MacIrssi, Textual, LimeChat, and Colloquy 
03:58  LaraX: spline: it matches your mrcoffee, no wonder you like him
03:58  spline: I say use each and find what works best for you
03:58  winegoddess: im using Colloquy - i somehow think i am missing some lines
03:59  spline: LaraX: he tolerates the discriminate types well if the pay is there, which he is commensurate with in worksmanship
03:59  Marvolo: I use Macirssi for logging for pisg.
04:00  Marvolo: it's good
04:00  spline: providing your client spits out "standard" logs (which you can usually convert with some perl-fu) 
04:00  winegoddess: can i navigate to a directory in finder and somehow copy that path to the clipboard?
04:00  spline: I don't log beyond ZNC so it doesn't matter
04:00  LaraX: winegoddess: you might be missing things because this can be hard to follow who's saying what without colored nicks, etc
04:01  Marvolo: http://midspin.webhop.net/Midspin/irchon/midspinstats.html
04:01  FriedBob: Plus, colloquoy is kinda crappy - or was last I used it.
04:01  spline: Colloquy nighties fix a lot of the bugs on 10.6/growl
04:01  jeffmr: spline is that spline as in the special function defined piecewise by polynomials or the mating mechanism on a driveshaft?
04:01  winegoddess: oooh - what do you all think of growl?  it got installed and i am not sure if i shoudl keep it
04:01  FriedBob: I like growl.
04:01  spline: I wanted a little more minimal --> went to MacIrssi (and have a bit of scripts) but didn't like some of the perl brokeness with 10.6 (developer is aware) -> so I found LimeChat but had no scripting -> Mikey took limechat and added "much needed things" I wanted
04:02  spline: that's how I arrived @ Textual
04:02  FriedBob: I'm still on 10.4
04:02  winegoddess: did 10.6 introduce a lot of problems for some software?
04:02  spline: winegoddess: growl rocks
04:02  FriedBob: Never saw a point to upgrade this Powerbook beyond 10.4
04:02  spline: jeffmr: yes it is. I took the name from 3d animation, though
04:02  spline: but same derivation 
04:03  LaraX: spline: I understand you think he's good, but first I'd have to know what it actually looks like, to know if I'd be interested. for example titanium looks silver (the color) and I was looking for something slightly yellow, and is this shiny, and would you have to keep polishing it like silver? I don't want to polish anything which is why platinum is nice but it's not goldish either
04:03  winegoddess: spline have you ever seen titanium with nobium that was exposed to diffeent voltages?
04:03  spline: LaraX: most of the .. "hard metals" are going to be "metal" in color (gunMetal might be a good way to say it)
04:03  spline: winegoddess: ofcourse. It's called anodization
04:03  jeffmr: no problems
04:03  spline: I don't use that but I've played with it. My guy does _amazing_ anodization and is an expert with it (you have to play around with acid so its not something you just want to do)
04:04  spline: I personally go minimal/no anodization on all my jewelry 
04:04  LaraX: see I need to learn about all these things. I know nothing about jewelry except I don't want anything fake where the paint keeps peeling off
04:04  winegoddess: i think im getting this wedding ring - it is so pretty http://www.titaniumringsforever.com/titanium-rings/niobium/newport
04:05  spline: LaraX: Titanium always has an oxide layer (why its so stubborn to polish) 
04:05  LaraX: that's annoying especially when it's an earring and it can go in your piercing
04:05  FriedBob: I like my tungsten ring
04:05  LaraX: the paint flakes
04:05  spline: winegoddess: one of the most beautiful rings I've ever seen in Ti: http://www.boonerings.com/stone-settings/helixx.htm
04:05  spline: I have a similar design done for when I encounter that day
04:06  spline: Bruce is also _awesome_ at rings and was one of the first doing it
04:06  winegoddess: LaraX i have it somewhat clor coded, but yeah - not keeping up well  - sorry! 
04:06  spline: plus, the guy makes the rings himself. It's not outsourced to China
04:06  LaraX: winegoddess: it's ok, another client/theme might help
04:06  spline: winegoddess: Check out www.codeux.com/textual -- mikey has a shot there
04:06  winegoddess: did anyone know how to copy the current directory path while viewing in FInder?
04:06  spline: I think LaraX and I are in it from the help channel
04:07  spline: winegoddess: yeah, you want to do it via a right click?
04:07  LaraX: spline: if titanium oxidizes like silver and you have to polish it I don't think I'd want it
04:07  spline: like a contextual menu?
04:07  spline: LaraX: it doesn't oxidize. Titanium is an inert metal
04:07  spline: (why its used for implants)
04:07  LaraX: [20] 10:04:56 PM <spline> LaraX: Titanium always has an oxide layer (why its so stubborn to polish) 
04:07  LaraX: ?
04:07  spline: hm lemme find a page on it
04:07  LaraX: I meant the top layer or whatever
04:08  LaraX: it turns dark right?
04:08  spline: LaraX: http://www.mrtitanium.com/interference.html
04:08  spline: that's how titanium gets colored
04:08  spline: (girls get these for naval rings and earrings)
04:08  LaraX: oh, it turns rainbow?!
04:08  spline: you can do that
04:08  spline: if you vary the voltage 
04:09  spline: doing anodization is not hard but also something you want to usually have shown to you. I've not done it because of the danger nor having the equipment
04:09  winegoddess: i used to be an electrical engineer so i thought it woudl be cool to have a ring that reflected that
04:10  spline: ah cool 
04:10  spline: yeah it's fun when you have a ring or something with a nice/polished surface with a good anodization
04:10  spline: the layer will chip though (no way to protect) after a bit
04:10  winegoddess: oh no!
04:10  spline: but you could re-anodize it
04:11  winegoddess: hmmm - im trying to right click and find the path somehow to copy to clipboard...not sure how to grab it
04:11  spline: winegoddess: you need a 10.6 service. know about them? 
04:11  winegoddess: nope
04:11  spline: I have a few on my  machine here
04:11  jeffmr: get info
04:11  winegoddess: im so glad i foudn this group! thanks! http://maketecheasier.com/improve-your-efficiency-with-mac-10-6-services/2009/12/27
04:11  jeffmr: right-click get info
04:12  spline: winegoddess: http://www.gingerbeardman.com/services/
04:12  spline: yeap
04:12  LaraX: spline: I love hoop earrings and these are nice: http://www.mrtitanium.com/ShowItems.cgi?Hoop&Type=Titanium+Hoops
04:12  spline: oh yeah you could do that. I think there is a cli shortcut
04:12  spline: LaraX: and Dan is also quite reasonable with what he charges on the stuff he makes en-masse
04:13  spline: LaraX: dan rocks for it. Evne if you called up and said ' Can I send you a drawing', he gets it done
04:13  LaraX: spline: some of them look too matte though, can they be made shinier? I like how it's colored metal though
04:13  spline: LaraX: dan is awesome at polishing if you wanted to change the surface
04:13  spline: he can do polished/matte/ball-peen
04:13  spline: anything
04:14  LaraX: but would that take the oxidized surface color away?
04:14  spline: the only thing Dan can't do is rings because he lacks a circular lathe, or did last I spoke with him
04:14  spline: on a polished? I don't think so
04:15  LaraX: the earring would just have to be thin and light so it doesn't rip my ear
04:15  spline: LaraX: http://www.mrtitanium.com/commissions.html the crucifix there pictured was by my friend alison for her fiance.. came out beautiful and he loved it
04:15  spline: LaraX: titanium is king there
04:16  spline: one of my ex's I got earrings for had the same issue on weight and loved titanium.. infect they were so light she would sometimes forget they were in
04:16  LaraX: some of the designs look interesting but they look too matte and the jewelry is too big, I like small stuff
04:17  LaraX: I have this pendant I really love but no good chain for it
04:17  LaraX: or whatever I have is the wrong length
04:18  spline: dan actually stocks chains
04:18  spline: I wound up breaking the one on my necklace @ first because I wanted something thin and it was too thin
04:18  LaraX: maybe I can take a pic of it like I did earlier but did you see how crappy that came out?
04:18  spline: he wound up even covering shipping back and replaced it
04:18  spline: I didn't see the picture earlier
04:19  LaraX: spline: it seems my phone can't take close up photos: http://lh5.ggpht.com/_JwaDcvsde7o/TL9gnDtdL2I/AAAAAAAAAdI/rWo3QlW7MRQ/SanrioLogo.jpg
04:19  LaraX: I was trying to take a pic of the old Sanrio logo because I might get a tattoo of it and can't find it online
04:20  jeffmr: lara did you hear about the guys who had a concert on the subway when their instruments got stolen?
04:20  LaraX: jeffmr: no, what happened?
04:20  spline: that sanario: http://www.sanrio.com/
04:20  jeffmr: just a sec
04:20  winegoddess: ugh i think i need a symbolic link...i really wish i knew how to do what i want! :)
04:20  spline: LaraX: I know a good inkman on the lower east side in alphabet city
04:20  jeffmr: http://gizmodo.com/5664798/band-rocks-out-on-iphones-after-their-instruments-are-stolen
04:20  spline: or really good actually
04:21  spline: did better ink than mine from a guy I found locally
04:21  LaraX: spline: Sanrio not Sanario and yes :) this is their old logo from when they started in the 70s to the mid 90s when they changed it
04:21  spline: LaraX: where would you place it?
04:21  spline: so many people these days transmogrify their bodies into NYC subway cars with inka
04:21  LaraX: I don't have any tattoos but really love this logo and have always loved Sanrio. it's a heart and I was thinking my lower back but not sure
04:22  LaraX: so either this and/or permanent makeup (which is also a tattoo)
04:22  jeffmr: inka?
04:23  LaraX: I need to find a better pic of it online or scan this maybe
04:24  LaraX: the reflection from the aluminum also kept getting in the way
04:26  spline: put scotchtape over it
04:26  spline: heh yeah women usually target the small of the back
04:27  jeffszusz: ?
04:27  jeffszusz: when shooting you?
04:27  osxdude: I've only today noticed audio cuts in iTunes music sharing
04:27  spline: if you do small, go under the forearm around the wrist area, since it could be covered with a small watchband or even compound if you went formal
04:27  LaraX: tape? the whole thing is metal and the camera and flash kept reflecting in it
04:27  spline: oh you're using a camera 
04:27  LaraX: jeffszusz: no, for tattoos...
04:27  spline: try lots of ambient light and no flash?
04:27  jeffszusz: oh
04:27  LaraX: spline: yeah my old camera phone
04:27  jeffszusz: tramp stamp
04:27  jeffszusz: ew
04:27  jeffszusz: i hate that.

04:34  spline: I hate when people put stickers on their mac
04:34  LaraX: jeffszusz: what about body painting or makeup?
04:34  jeffszusz: makeup is bleh
04:34  jeffszusz: body paint can be fun i suppose
04:34  LaraX: you don't like anything!
04:34  spline: well, I get compliments on my tattoos.. intended them to be that way
04:34  jeffszusz: lol
04:34  jeffszusz: who wants to wear makeup anyway?
04:34  jeffszusz: i mean really
04:34  LaraX: me
04:34  spline: makeup done right
04:34  jeffszusz: you can't lick makeup
04:34  jeffmr: sure you can
04:34  LaraX: so, you can lick the non-makeup parts
04:34  jeffszusz: it gets all over the pillow
04:34  jeffmr: lol
04:34  jeffszusz: and my shirt
04:35  spline: like eva green not when you rival the entire makeup department @ Macys on 34th street for the amount you have on
04:35  LaraX: spline: you have tattoos?
04:35 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 86 seconds
04:35  LaraX: again with makeup, same as tattoos, it can be done right or wrong
04:36  jeffmr: right to who?
04:36  LaraX: to whoever
04:36  winegoddess: i just used vi to create a file and now opened it in finder - gotta be an easier way
04:36  spline: yeah, my ex did a small symbol on her left wrist. She had a small Movado so it couldn't be covered entirely with the band alone
04:36  jeffszusz: makeup is best for formal occasions
04:36  spline: a little compound and that went away
04:36  jeffmr: that would mean anything could be right or wrong
04:36  jeffszusz: i hate when women wear makeup every day
04:36  spline: since she worked @ a formal place so tattoos wouldn't be bad but also better to not show up. Same applies for formal attire
04:37  spline: winegoddess: what types of files are you looking to create?
04:37  LaraX: jeffszusz: almost all women wear makeup every day, you just might not know about it because it's done right and intended not to show
04:37  spline: LaraX: amen there
04:37  LaraX: makeup can be used to conceal or enhance
04:37  jeffszusz: LaraX : i know very well that most women do, and it is bleh
04:37  winegoddess: jeffmr: files to represent virtual hosts. http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/05/16/supercharge-mamp/   ending in .conf
04:37  jeffmr: there was a girl in high school I liked.  she never wore makeup and she used to spit her gum in the air during class and catch it.
04:37  LaraX: jeffszusz: I think I'd know more than you since I am one
04:37  winegoddess: i coudlnt figure out a quic way to right-click new file...
04:38  jeffmr: wg, cool that looks like a good app
04:38  LaraX: jeffmr: or so you think. you should see her face after she gets out of the shower, then you'll know
04:39  LaraX: makeup isn't just lipstick and eyeliner and obvious stuff you know
04:39  jeffmr: no, my sisters said she didn't ware it
04:39  jeffmr: she, really didn't wear it
04:39  LaraX: ok
04:39  jeffszusz: winegoddess, is it just vim you don't like to use, or the command line in general?
04:39  winegoddess: vi
04:39  winegoddess: i remember very little
04:39  winegoddess: insert
04:39  winegoddess: q
04:39  winegoddess: x
04:39  jeffszusz: ok
04:39  winegoddess: :)
04:39  jeffmr: use pico
04:40  winegoddess: oh, but in this case
04:40  jeffszusz: next time you can either use nano
04:40  jeffszusz: or if you just want to create the file but not write anything to it
04:40  winegoddess: i find it comepletely unnecessary - al iwanted to do was create a file by pastng in contents
04:40  spline: :wq!
04:40  winegoddess: i coudlnt find a way to do that in Finder
04:40  spline: winegoddess: drag the contents from your browser to the desktop (yes off the app)
04:40  jeffmr: god dammit winegoddess, take our information and use it!
04:40  spline: it creates a textclipping
04:40  jeffszusz: open up terminal and type 
04:40  jeffmr: jk
04:40  jeffszusz: echo "" > whatever.conf
04:40  spline: now the the textclipping will be 0b in unix because it uses a resourceFork to store but Finder opens it just fine
04:41  winegoddess: jeffmr: my point was - i didnt want to have to issue a command line
04:41  jeffmr: I know
04:41  winegoddess: there has got to be a way to right-click create file or something. 
04:41  jeffszusz: winegoddess: the problem is that Finder sucks, and apple just doesn't seem to want to fix it.
04:41  winegoddess: ah )
04:41  winegoddess: :)
04:41  jeffszusz: you either have to open up your fav text editor (text wrangler is a great free one)
04:42  jeffszusz: and create a new file with it
04:42  jeffszusz: or else use the command line.
04:42  jeffszusz: other option is to google "Path Finder" and pay for a finder that doesn't suck.
04:42  jeffszusz: which is what i did.
04:42  winegoddess: okay - so i want to point to a directory that has a space in the name
04:42  jeffszusz: it lets you show invisible files, create empty text files, manage files in a dual-pane window...etc.
04:43  jeffmr: oh no
04:43  winegoddess: im trying to getthere from Terminal, but even hitting Tab, it puts in a backslash, but doesnt actually go anywhere
04:43  jeffmr: here we go
04:43  jeffmr: backslash indicates space
04:43  jeffmr:  then space the rest of it
04:44  spline: winegoddess: check out stationary pallet here: http://homepage.mac.com/tkurita/scriptfactory/en/index.html#applications
04:44  spline: to do what you want
04:46  LaraX: spline: you're not Asian right?
04:46  jeffszusz: O_O
04:46  jeffmr: ?
04:46  LaraX: I was wondering because of his Asian necklace/tattoos
04:46  jeffmr: she's of the humanoid species
04:46  LaraX: spline is a he
04:46  spline: LaraX: nope
04:46  LaraX: ok
04:46  spline: LaraX: just enjoy their culture
04:47  LaraX: spline: me too but especially Japanese
04:47  sileni: hey guys!
04:47  spline: same
04:47  spline: LaraX: I had custom-made titanium chopstix because of that
04:47  LaraX: spline: but are these things in Japanese and what do they say?
04:47  LaraX: hi
04:47  spline: and my love for sushi
04:47  LaraX: wow
04:48  sileni: ok im working on developing an ipad app for my senior project, i'm at home on linux is it possible to ssh into the mac and x forward and work with xcode?
04:48  jeffmr: what does being a he have to do with anything?
04:48  jeffszusz: sileni: aqua isn't actually running on X, so no. but you might be able to use VNC.
04:48  LaraX: jeffmr: because you said ""she's" on the humanoid species"?
04:49  spline: LaraX: they make great conversation at my local bistro
04:49  sileni: jeffszusz: oh ok 
04:49  LaraX: of*
04:49  jeffmr: oh
04:49  sileni: jeffszusz: thank you for the quick response
04:49  jeffmr: I meant s/he
04:49  jeffszusz: sileni: turn on the remote desktop
04:49  sileni: jeffszusz: but vnc would require the mac to be running a vnc server?
04:49  spline: the mac is
04:49  spline: "Remote Desktop" is VNC with some apple additions
04:50  sileni: jeffszusz: do i need to have SU acess to turn on remote desktop ?
04:50  jeffszusz: yeah but i'm pretty sure apple's remote desktop = VNC
04:50  spline: so you can use your favorite VNC viewer, even the one that works in the browser
04:50  spline: it is
04:50  spline: I even use the "Flash" based VNC viewer "Flashlight"
04:50  jeffszusz: sileni: you probably have to be at the mac's keyboard to enable the mac's remote desktop but i could be wrong.
04:50  spline: and it works fine with Apple's quirks 
04:50  spline: jeffszusz: there is a quick way to do it via the command-line.. forgetting it but its documented
04:51  LaraX: spline: so what's your ethnicity then? not sure if you tood me
04:51  LaraX: told
04:51  jeffmr: possibly from the planet earth
04:52  LaraX: no I think he's from Mars
04:52  spline: LaraX: wasp? heh
04:52  sileni: jeffszusz: that defeats my purpose if i have to go to computer right now. Is there any alternative you know of ?
04:52 * LaraX gets the fly swat
04:52  spline: or irish/scotch/german/italian
04:52  LaraX: ok
04:53  jeffmr: everyone's from africa in the end
04:53  jeffszusz: if you can't get to your computer right now, the chances you will be able to use xcode from it are low; that's something you'd be wise to prepare ahead of time for the next time you need to do it.
04:53  jeffszusz: how far away is your home machine?
04:53  sileni: i'm at my home machine right now 
04:53  LaraX: ok I need to restart
04:53  jeffszusz: ah and your mac is at work or something?
04:53  sileni: i don't have physical acess to my school mac machine
04:53  sileni: yes 
04:54  sileni: access *
04:54  jeffszusz: ahhh
04:54  jeffszusz: likely the school won't dig you using remote desktop anyway
04:54  Branes: jeff's right - for security reasons, you must be at the machine to enable remote access of any kind.
04:54  sileni: ah ok 
04:54  jeffszusz: you might want to look at alternate IDE's
04:55  spline: well if you have to build OSX stuff, unless you're cool with doing the makefiles
04:55  spline: there is xcodebuild on the Command line
04:55  jeffszusz: or you could just work in some other editor and do any mac-specific stuff in xcode later. that's what i'd probably do.
04:55  spline: yeah
04:56  sileni: i need to be able to compile and test 
04:56  sileni: it is ok, i will just read up on the procedure and work on it at school
04:56  sileni: now i know the way to set it up :D
04:56  Branes: Apple Remote Desktop is a superset of the VNC protocol; before you can use a genericl VNC viewer you have to enable "allow VNC connections" on the machine you want to access/control.
04:57  sileni: maybe they have it enabled
04:57  Branes: Not by default.
04:57  jeffszusz: sileni: it's doubtful they would enable remote access
04:57  Marvolo: you also would need to open some port somewhere
04:57  jeffszusz: i'm surprised the school gives you SSH access to a machine
04:57  winegoddess: spline:  oooh - i think stationary is helping!  or maybe i just found out how to use finder better
04:57  Marvolo: outside of the serving machine
04:57  spline: winegoddess: there are tons of little things like that app (and nice of the programmer to also open-source)
04:57  spline: for 10.6 
04:57  Branes: You'll also need to know the machine's direct IP number, and if it is part of a LAN, the routing system has to know a direct path to it.
04:58  spline: just need to find it. irc and channels like this are great for it since a lot of us here like this stuff
04:58  sileni: Branes: i have all that 
04:58  winegoddess: i really apreciate the help so far
04:58  spline: Branes: or use a DynDNS system
04:58  spline: winegoddess: I try to keep track of this since there is a lot of it out there not necessarily posted to hint sites like www.macosxhints.com or if you surf macupdate/osx.iusethis.com
05:03  winegoddess: oooooh! i am excted! i was able to flush the cache and not need to restart to get the hosts updated! my first mac thing that i like over pc
05:04  spline: dscl -flushhosts?
05:04  spline: or am I still using the 10.5 syntax
05:04  spline: yeah OSX has the "odd" way of flushing hosts if you update /etc/hosts
05:04  winegoddess: dscacheutil -flushcache
05:04  spline: bah that's it
05:04  spline: it changed a few times over the years
05:04  winegoddess: got it form a webpage - i dunno what version is what - all i know - it works!!! i was able to hit my website loclly!
05:04  spline: I do all my DNS now on tomatowrt so I don't have to worry about it
05:04  spline: at least for my local boxes

05:31  Tomis: look in the preferences Marvolo 
05:31  Marvolo: Wow I'm lame
05:31  Marvolo: lol thanks
05:32  Tomis: no worries
05:32  Marvolo: I think that might be the first time I've even been in those preferences.
05:40  Kasm279: wow these olde3r headpones suck
05:52  bsdbandit: anyone coding in assembly on the mac 
05:52  bsdbandit: ?
05:52  Tomis: you could, but why
05:52  jeffszusz: lol
05:54  bsdbandit: well im trying to learn assembly 
05:55  jeffszusz: i recommend linux in a vm
05:56  jeffszusz: just to be safe and to make your life easier
05:56  FriedBob: Or DOS in a VM
05:56  jeffszusz: or that yeah
05:56  jeffszusz: a VM is th ekey
05:56  jeffszusz: the key* rather
05:57  jeffszusz: if you're going to play close to the metal, a vm is always nice for making sure you don't bork up your system.
05:57  bsdbandit: ok
05:57  FriedBob: Or get an old PC and load dos baremetal, and it won't matter then either
05:57  bsdbandit: so running linux in vm will be fine 
05:58  bsdbandit: and that wont mess with my box will it 
05:58  bsdbandit: ?
05:58  FriedBob: No
06:00  bsdbandit: oh ok 
06:00  FriedBob: if you are on an intelmac, running Linux baremetal can damage it
06:01  Tomis: best place for any 3rd party OS is a VM
06:01  Tomis: then you can delete it without partition muckery
06:01  Tomis: though you can run windows bare metal w/ apple's drivers
06:01  FriedBob: Tomis: yeah, VM or it's own hardware (which is what I prefer to do)
06:05  netdaemon: Tomis: same with linux too
06:05  netdaemon: if you're into that kinda thing
06:05  netdaemon: use bootcamp to create the partition and just install linux to said partition...won't use apple's drivers though (obviously)
06:07  FriedBob: netdaemon: and that will damage the mac
06:07  netdaemon: FriedBob: well it boots fine and all (both OSs)
06:07  netdaemon: but yeah...battery life is cut in half...
06:07  netdaemon: heat is double...
06:08  FriedBob: It will kill the CPU
06:08  netdaemon: due to heat
06:08  netdaemon: i didn't keep the dual boot long because of that
06:08  netdaemon: virtualization is *much* safer for that
06:09  FriedBob: Not actually heat.
06:09  netdaemon: timings?
06:09  FriedBob: The CPU is permantly overvolted
06:09  FriedBob: Unless you use the drivers / OSX
06:09  FriedBob: the chips on the macs are custom for Apple
06:10  netdaemon: hrm...
06:10  netdaemon: well it's been a while since i'v actually had linux on here...=\
06:10  netdaemon: the 1/2 battery life instantly turned me off
06:11  FriedBob: netdaemon: Catch Branes sometimes, he can explain it better. He's certified apple tech and has seen the effects of a lot
06:11  netdaemon: of my linux installs, they've not stayed very long
06:11  netdaemon: i'v had this particular MBP for a  year, nothing wrong with it * yet*
06:12  netdaemon: don't plan on trying again
06:12  FriedBob: I've never had an MB or MBP, and unless someone gives me one, won't.
06:12  netdaemon: i'm quite happy with keeping other OSs in a virt sandbo
06:12  netdaemon: x
06:12  FriedBob: I do, however, <3 my 12" PowerBook G4
06:12  netdaemon: and my system seems to thank me for it
06:13  netdaemon: even when i did bootcamp with windows, it seemed to cut battery life and increase heat

06:28  Branes: netdaemon: The reason why non-OSX on Apple hardware sucks for heat & short battery is because Apple's custom power chip forces the host OS to micromanage everything, instead of the usual approach of the host OS relying on the built-in smarts of the SMbus controller electronics.
06:28  tos9: TL;DR: Apple did dumb shit.
06:29  Bensawsome: just like there new os?
06:29  Bensawsome: lol
06:29  Branes: It's not dumb, it gives OSX long battery life, something people have wanted.
06:29  tos9: Branes: Not really, they just offloaded the work from the power controller to the OS, which could have equally well did it.
06:30  Branes: If it could, they would have done it - they figured out that using the OS was better at it.
06:31  tos9: They have, haven't they? The newer hardware shifts more work back, no?
06:32  Branes: It's just part of their ethos of total control :)
06:32  LSD`: As long as it works under OS X, I couldn't care less :)
06:33  Branes: tos9: Remember, Apple have a 30+ year history of changing hardware to suit the software, and all they care about is their OS.
06:33  tos9: Branes: Sure. It's not dumb for them. They do smart stuff for themselves.
06:33  netdaemon: i do have a question, what is the prefered torrent client on OSX?
06:34  Branes: Transmission.
06:34  FriedBob: I use Tomato
06:34  Bensawsome: transmission
06:34  tos9: netdaemon: I like Transmission, it's lightweight, but a bunch of trackers don't like it.
06:34  Bensawsome: lol
06:34  FriedBob: But I am also using 10.4 and PPC
06:34  netdaemon: so i take it uTorrent is still a joke? lol
06:34  LSD`: Transmission also has this annoying problem: It's DOG SLOW >_<
06:35  tos9: netdaemon: A joke? Why? It's fine too.
06:35  netdaemon: hm
06:35  LSD`: is uTorrent for Mac still lightyears behind the Windows version?
06:35  Branes: The OSX version *is* a joke.
06:36  tos9: Probably, but who the hell cares. I open a torrent program once a month at most, and all I need really is basic features, and a web interface which is sometimes nice.
06:36  tos9: uTorrent and Transmission are both light.
06:37  Branes: It's been umm, six years since I fired up a torrent program, and it was only due to curiosity.
06:38  FriedBob: I torrent Slackware ISOs when there is a new release, but that is about it
06:38  FriedBob: And I do that on my winbox
06:40  netdaemon: lol
06:40  netdaemon: slackware, been ages since i used it
06:44  FriedBob: Only Linux I run on my machines
06:45  Kasm279: i use tomato
06:47  netdaemon: i try to remain impartial to OSs
06:47  netdaemon: use whats best per task
06:47  FriedBob: Same here, but while I can use any distro, Slack is what I like and know best, so that makes it best suited for what I do at home
06:47  Bensawsome: netdaemon exactly :D
06:48  FriedBob: That's why I also run OSX and Win7 at home
06:48  netdaemon: FriedBob: same for desktops
06:48  netdaemon: i have an ubuntu server
06:48  Kasm279: Windows is best for me with daily use beacuse allmy Macs are under 1GHz and all G3s
06:49  Kasm279: except for video editing that is
06:49  FriedBob: Kasm279: Mine is only slightly better. 1.5ghz G4
06:49  netdaemon: i quite enjoy my MBP with snow leopard :)
06:49  netdaemon: desktop runs win7
06:49  Kasm279: i always use my G3 iMac for that because it has firewire
06:49  netdaemon: server...thats the ubuntu box
06:49  netdaemon: for now
06:49  Kasm279: FriedBob: that isn't bad
06:49  Kasm279: whats that, a PBG4?
06:49  FriedBob: Kasm279: Yeah. But the 512mb RAM sucks.
06:50  Kasm279: 12"
06:50  Kasm279: ?
06:50  FriedBob: Yeah, the 12" G4 PB
06:50  Kasm279: if you want to get rid of it let me know :o
06:50  FriedBob: I bought it a few months before the mactels were announced.
06:50  FriedBob: Kasm279: By the time I get rid of this, it won't be running, or able to be fixed.
06:50  Kasm279: D:
06:51  FriedBob: Anywho, I need to head to bed. Been up since 0530 and it's 2352. I'm just glad I don't have to work tomorrow so I can recover from the last 2 days.
06:53  FriedBob: manual labor / retail sales/mamagement after 5+ years at a deskjob is hard on the knees and feet!
07:28  dpecka: hi there
07:29  dpecka: howt list from cli please a devices? eg harddrives .. fdisk works deifferent
07:39  richardcavell: Hi gang.  
07:39  richardcavell: What's the word on Lion?  Any goss?
07:40  jeffszusz: i just know it's not due to come out until summer 2011
07:41  richardcavell: that's a long time for something that doesn't have very many new features
07:44  CPng|N: perhaps you're used to microsoft's half assed release approach
07:44  richardcavell: ha ha
07:44  Ballresin: Has anyone run into a decent coding ide for iPad?
07:44  CPng|N: ie: xcode?
07:44  netdaemon: ...coding on an ipad?
07:44  netdaemon: i feel for you
07:45  Ballresin: Running on the iPad, yes.
07:45  richardcavell: yeah coding on an iPad ???
07:45  CPng|N: oh
07:45  Ballresin: Bluetooth keyboard folks.
07:45  richardcavell: well that's a bit more bearable
07:45  CPng|N: lol yeah. it's called notepad.app
07:45  netdaemon: still, i don't think the iPad was meant for dev
07:46  netdaemon: dev for it on another machine, sure...but deving on it...
07:46  CPng|N: not at all
07:46  Ballresin: It works fine for writing php, I just need an SFTP client built into a text editor with syntax highlighting.
07:49  Ballresin: Preferably a GIT client...
07:49  tigerx1078: hi room if i'm using snow leopard now i shouldn't have a probleam with the specs for lion when it arrives right?
07:50  Ballresin: Sure
07:50  remyo: tigerx1078: I would hope so. 
07:50  Ballresin: But we've only just had a taste...
07:51  tigerx1078: me to remyo i have a black macbook and i hope so to its a little out dated
07:51  Ballresin: Are your specs better than the new Air?
07:51  tigerx1078: i doubt it hehe
07:51  Ballresin: 1.4ghz core 2duo 2gb ram
07:52  tigerx1078: mine is 2.4ghz core 2duo 2gb of ram lol
07:52  Ballresin: You might be ok
07:52  remyo: But is yours flash memory :D
07:52  tigerx1078: no
07:52  Ballresin: ??
07:52  tigerx1078: internal lol
07:53  remyo: That seems like the most appealing feature of the air though 
07:53  remyo: Everything else is kind of "meh" isn't it?
07:53  tigerx1078: ok
07:53  Ballresin: It's a blah feature.
07:53  tigerx1078: i'll just have to sit n wait like the rest of yall
07:53  Ballresin: Big deal, flash on the board. Install an SSD on your MacBook...
07:54  tigerx1078: i have ssd lol
07:54  Ballresin: SSD is good.
07:54  Ballresin: I don't know if the flash in the Air is SSD... Need to research that.
07:55  tigerx1078: yea i have a black macbook so mine was i think right before the new macbooks
07:55  Branes: Ballresin: It is. Most likely a Toshiba module.
07:55  Ballresin: I have a 2 year old MacBook, it will be fine.
07:55  remyo: tigerx1078: I like the black macbooks a lot
07:56  remyo: Wonder if they'll ever bring them back
07:56  Ballresin: Toshiba doesn't make SSDs
07:56  Ballresin: Just flash
07:56  Ballresin: Not to my knowledge.
07:56  tigerx1078: ya i gave a pretty penny for this one lol
07:56  Ballresin: Which one you have?
07:56  Branes: SSD *is* flash RAM, ball :)
07:57  Branes: And there's two Toshiba SSDs for Airs on my bench on the other side of the room here :)
07:57  Ballresin: Sure, but flash isn't ssd
07:57  Branes: yes it is.
07:57  tigerx1078: ballresin i dont know witch black mac book i have how i can i tell lol
07:57  Ballresin: Talking about mlc and slc vs the stuff in a typical USB drive.
07:57  CPng|N: ssd is simply solid state drive. that's basically any nonvolatile mass storage device
07:58  Branes: tigerx1078: Find your model (eg MacBook3,2) from System Profiler, then check it against www.everymac.com
08:00  Branes: Ball, the chips found in the slowest USB flash-drive and the fastest SSD both use NOR2VRAM technology. It's all in the implementation.
08:00  tigerx1078: MacBook4,1 in 2008
08:00  Ballresin: Ok
08:05  torchie: so
08:05  torchie: how slow is it when you reach swap using SSD
08:40  yarco: hi, how to mount linux system on mac os x?
08:40  richardcavell: you mean linux file system?
08:40  richardcavell: ext it's called
08:40  yarco: yes
08:42  LaraX: uh oh
08:42  LaraX: do any of you use MobileMe?
08:42  richardcavell: yarco: mate I haven't checked in a year but last time I checked there was an open source ext for osx thing happening but it wasn't actively maintained
08:42  richardcavell: and it's not safe to use, especially with ext4
08:42  LaraX: danl: poke
08:43  yarco: oh...
08:44  yarco: one of my servers stoped and when restarting it said " raid error" or something like that. and i mount to mount the disk on to my mac os x and to fetch data.

09:29  danl: LaraX: thats what they make blankets for ;)
09:40  LaraX: danl: yeah, if I were in bed, which I'm not :)
09:41  LaraX: danl: I deleted a MobileMe email by mistake, I pressed backspace thinking it was the shortcut to go to the previous page like I usually use and instead it put the email in the trash. is there any way to put it back in the inbox or only archive it? I just wanted it in the inbox
09:42  LaraX: spline: fall is the coldest time in apts, where it gets cold all of a sudden but not cold enough for them to give heat yet. I think I'm going to turn my radiator on
09:43  LaraX: as in my own seperate one I plug in, not the one built into the building
09:43  spline: I thought you could go into the trash and undelete
09:43  LaraX: can you? I'm looking
09:43  spline: it does like how google mail works.. you have 30 days. I don't use mobile me only gmail though
09:43  spline: been on there for 5 years full time now so im not sure otherwise
09:44  spline: LaraX: how high are you up in the air though?
09:44  LaraX: yeah it's not gone from the trash, but I was only able to archive it, I want to put it back in the inbox
09:44  LaraX: not as high as my old apt but it's cold either way
09:44  spline: when my ex lived on the ground floor, totally the same way. Moved to the UES and on the 5th floor it'd stay hot till being below 50 at night
09:44  spline: on the archive, search for the email and you should be able to move it back to the inbox folder, I'd think
09:45  LaraX: I'm trying
09:45  LaraX: ok let me see
09:45  LaraX: separate*
09:46  spline: when you trash an email, you have to untrash with google
09:46  spline: but once there you can move it around
09:46  danl: LaraX: is it not in the trash?
09:47  spline: LaraX: speaking of apartments, did you see the "rent is too damn high" party there?
09:47  spline: the guy is running for Spitzer/patterson (ny go)
09:47  spline: gov
09:48  LaraX: danl: it was in the trash, but I wanted to put it back in the inbox, it only let me archive it... how do I put it in the inbox?
09:49  LaraX: spline: I use gmail too, this is a MobileMe trial, I had another one in January
09:49  spline: LaraX: http://discussions.info.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12428151
09:50  danl: LaraX: web mail?
09:50  LaraX: I was googling too but thought this should be a simple thing
09:50  LaraX: danl: yeah
09:50  danl: drag it to the inbox...
09:51  danl: webmail is very application like
09:51  spline: heh this is why I use gmail
09:51  spline: even though I suffered through the non-imap years
09:51  LaraX: oh I see, thanks :)
09:51  LaraX: now is it ok to delete the archive folder it created?
09:51  spline: LaraX: did the drag work? should be a lot like gmail
09:51  spline: yeah just not the email itself
09:51  LaraX: yeah drag worked
09:51  danl: You can also use the Move to Folder button (folder icon with down arrow)
09:51  spline: folder is just a folder
09:52  danl: and choose inbox
09:52  LaraX: spline: I don't have much experience with gmail either actually because I hate email but need to get used to it
09:52 * danl starts spamming lara
09:52  spline: LaraX: I one day just centralized on it to make life simpler 
09:52  LaraX: I like conversations in real time like texts/IMs/IRC but you can't do that with everyone
09:53  spline: run my mrcoffee.org mail there now, too, and nearly all the clients at work have moved over to it

09:54  LaraX: danl: spam is a big part of why I hate email...
09:54  spline: LaraX: yeah, I use irc for convo even though my responses tend to be 3-5 sentences
09:54  spline: I absolute _fucking_ hate email pollution
09:54  spline: thankfully our group is small and doesn't do it
09:55  LaraX: though I've gotten IM/text spam to my cell phone from AIM/Yahoo too!
09:55  spline: keep it minimal, pithy and short
09:55  spline: aha nowonder you go +g then
09:55  spline: aim isn't opt-in like gchat
09:56  LaraX: spline: many people don't know what they're doing with email though and get you spammed, like if they give your email to sites to send an ecard or some crap
09:56  spline: yes... im big on that
09:56  LaraX: or those sites that search your address book to see who you know there, I'm sure they spam you too
09:56  spline: well that's why I call people in the end. When a good friend sends an email, I usually wind up archive or somewhere out of the inbox
09:56  spline: and give them a call
09:57  spline: its a great excuse to  use the phone anyways
09:57  LaraX: I got an invite for dropbox, I hope that's not going to spam me too
09:57  LaraX: I don't really want it anyway
09:57  LaraX: spline: yeah but don't you get spam on your cell phone too?
09:58  LaraX: I've gotten it from Sprint too
09:58  spline: well I have Prowl on my iPhone so I get a bit of notifications... but most of my channels are streamlined
09:58  danl: yes lara, you can delete the archive folder
09:58  LaraX: ok thanks danl... also aren't you at work now?
09:58  spline: its not actively on a "number" unless im on the app there (since I don't maintain active service) I only maintain a Google Voice number I call from
09:59  spline: so much noise in this modern world
09:59  LaraX: I know
09:59  LaraX: I'll use Google Voice as soon as they let me import a number, there are no 212 numbers there
10:03  LaraX: I deleted something on my cell phone the other day that was talking about Viagra or some drugs, and it looked like when someone texts a phone from AIM
10:04  LaraX: and Yahoo has some sex bots or something
10:08  LaraX: danl: you know that original welcome email MobileMe sends you breaks SSL from the image
10:08  spline: LaraX: they'll never have 212
10:08  spline: unless you port
10:08  spline: I have a 917 
10:08  spline: but that's im sure out of the quest now since they're on 646
10:09  LaraX: spline: I have 646 and they don't let you port (yet)
10:09  spline: ah
10:09  spline: diff fone # than your wireless card?
10:09  LaraX: my GV # is 646, cell phone is 917 but I want to change it to 212
10:09  LaraX: yeah the card is another number, 646
10:10  spline: 212 is so coveted 
10:10  spline: I almost shelled out the # just for one once
10:10  spline: I would absolutely love 212-867-5309
10:10  spline: my favorite phone number in the world but really any areacode
10:10  LaraX: I thought it was really hard to get until I found out Verizon has many available
10:10  spline: they have tons of blocks they're assigned
10:10  spline: and now numbers are so portable, you can get many
10:11  LaraX: I know exactly what number I want and am trying to get it but it's been a hassle
10:11  spline: I had a 213 before just to look like I was in LA. kinda helps when im doing more independent work
10:11  spline: when you look local
10:11  spline: LaraX: well 867-5309 is quite famous
10:11  LaraX: I know
10:11  spline: oh haha
10:11  spline: I can't tell you the number of people that are like huh 867?
10:11  spline: and im like.. jenny.. I got your numbber
10:12  spline: it was before our time
10:12  LaraX: for mine I want it to start with 212 and I know what I want it to end with but am more flexible about what the exchange is, I got a list of Verizon's exchanges for my area, and Sprint's, but it's hard to get anyone to do it. Verizon does it for an exxtra charge every month
10:13  LaraX: yeah I know the song :)
10:13  spline: LaraX: 212 are so coveted though. usually also reserved for landlines and im sure Verizon keeps a leash on it when they can
10:13  LaraX: extra*
10:13  spline: last number I had was when my dad had a cell when he worked there
10:13  spline: wish he kept that since by the time I got a cell, even 917 became crowded 
10:13  LaraX: well you can get it for a land line then transfer it to a cell phone right? just like with any other number
10:14  spline: if they allow it (should now)
10:14  spline: but get a 212 in the first place. it's mainly for landlines/offices now
10:14  spline: I'd have to ask a friend of mine on how easy it would be to socially engineer
10:14  spline: I really don't know since I was cool with having my 917 even though im 200 miles away or could be anywhere
10:14  LaraX: I think they're giving heat now, I can feel it because I always get sick from it

10:24  spline: I had a mac program that did the same type of thing
10:25  spline: 917 was started for wireless there
10:25  spline: LaraX: well I've not lived there for some time now. I also got in on GrandCentral in late 06' long before google voice + the number grab
10:25  LaraX: the only reason I have 917 is because I got it before 646 existed

14:29  Tu13es: it's a great idea for Apple, definitely
14:29  koro: Branes: orly?
14:30  Angostura: Oh, it could well be inevitable, but if you're not saying it is a great idea, why are you dissing people who say "it's not a great idea" Branes ?

14:30  Angostura: "What disappoints me is the blinkered, instant-disgust reaction I get when I push forward the iOS Desktop concept"
14:30  Branes: Apple -- Steve -- wants the great unwashed using his iProduct, as many as possible, and by making things stupidly easy to use, the stupid will buy them by the containerload. But he doesn't want to completely alienate the existing nerd-base, even though he no longer gives them any form of credit or acknowledgement. He does still need programs to run on his iProducts.
14:31  Angostura: so?
14:31  koro: If i saw steve jobs on the streets i'd kick him in the nuts
14:31  Branes: Nerds and geeks hate having *anyone* hold their hand whilst they do stuff. It's part of our make-up :)
14:32  Angostura: Branes: Not true. That's why I don't use Slackware
14:32  Tu13es: koro: i'm sure
14:33  Tu13es: anyway, I'm just assuming they'll make iOS the OS because then they get 30% of *everything*
14:33  Tu13es: (MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA)
14:33  Angostura: I suspect Apple will start shipping desktop keyboards with trackpads built in as standard soon - that might make an iOS interface make more sense
14:33  Branes: That's closer to the truth than you realise, Tully :)
14:34  LSD`: If they build a keyboard with an inbuilt trackpad I'll be lining up to buy one
14:34  Tu13es: Branes: i'm only kidding with the meniacal laugh
14:34  LSD`: ....just as long as it's wired
14:34  Tu13es: the first sentence is true
14:34  Angostura: Branes: And you think that's a good thing?
14:34  koro: i'm not sure a trackpad is even better than a mouse at replacing a touch interface
14:34  koro: er, touchscreen
14:34  Angostura: koro: Multi-touch
14:34  koro: yeah, but the problem is that it's a pointing thing
14:35  koro: you have to "direct the arrow"
14:35  Branes: For Apple? yes. For Joe & Jane Average? Definitely! For people with more than six months behind the keyboard? Not a bloody hope in hell, it'll be annoying as getting buggered by Big Tom.
14:35  koro: it's different in principle :/
14:35  Angostura: Branes and yet: "What disappoints me is the blinkered, instant-disgust reaction I get when I push forward the iOS Desktop concept"
14:35  LSD`: koro: vertical, largely immobile touch screens suck anyway. After using a laptop for 3 years, I just hate having to reach over to a mouse for simple things
14:36  Angostura: Why, precisely are you dispointed?
14:36  koro: LSD`: yes, they suck
14:36  koro: and i agree with the mouse thing
14:36  LSD`: They're OK on phones and the like because you can hold them horizontally
14:36 * Angostura still a mouse fan
14:36  Tu13es: Angostura: I assume he meant the fact that nerds argue that we won't see an iOS desktop
14:36  koro: i'm not saying a trackad wouldn't be nice, i just don't think it will make an iOS interface make more sense
14:36  acer_: Apple sells tousands more iPhones, iPods, iPads then iMacs. Thats the thing. For Apple having to carry PCs as an exclusive product would be very hard. So why not globalize their products, like design, hardware and even OS. The thing here is the user of a PC is completly different from others. Apple is no longer a computer company.
14:37  Tu13es: man, it was awkward watching that guy use the magic mouse with two hands yesterday
14:37  LSD`: Angostura: I won't be trading in my mouse, but I find a trackpad more convenient for day-to-day stuff, especially with the multitouch gestures

14:40  acer_: Branes, yeah, PC are not profitable anymore. So let this market for someone who wants it. Maybe we are really getting old and not seing the future enough. Maybe next generations won't use PCs as we are. Maybe PCs are in extincion.
14:41  Tu13es: Branes: I thought you meant Acer sees the big picture for about 3 minutes
14:41  Tu13es: heh
14:41  LSD`: Eventually, we'll move to an environment where everything's connected to everything else all with a common interface or interfaces like the LCARS system in star trek
14:43  Branes: No, Ango, I'm not jumping for joy, although I do see it as a good step forward in the evolution of computer interaction. Until we can go out and buy LCARS datapads, or a Knowledge Navigator, or some super holo interface that would be at home on the set of Minority Report, computers as they currently stand are a dead end. Hell, even Microsoft knows this.
14:43  acer_: If Apple has create some of the most admirable product of the market nowadays, why don't trust them when they say PCs are "in transition" or something. There is only two possible alternatives, Steve is leaving Apple and those new guys are full of new ideas (and money to try it). Or everyone got crazzy at Apple by Google pressure.
14:44  acer_: Man, maybe we are old dinosaur addicted to old PCs... :P
14:44  Branes: acer_: People -- especially geeks -- don't like too much change at once, and far too many of them still cling to the old ways, believing that knowing how to do complex computer things makes them more powerful than other 'normal' people. 
14:45  acer_: Imagine, we want mouses and keybords attached to our computer!!! wow!
14:45  LSD`: Branes: you say that, but those same geeks will get hard over the zillions of compatibilitiy-breaking changes that occur in Lnux all the time
14:45  Branes: The *good* thing about the iOS interface coming to more computing-devices is it means greater acceptance. The *bad* thing about iOS is the lock-down and insane control Apple will have over your digital lifestyle.
14:47  acer_: I just can't see anything productive inside of this new Apple box. Unfortunatly I use my Mac to work. And I need it attached to a mouse and a keyboard. I just don't see where this new OS fetures will fit on this context.
14:48  acer_: I this Apple hardware are not intent to professinal market anymore. It's designed to entretainment market.
14:49  acer_: Entertaimnent is a much more profitable market then professinal one. By professinal I mean Sound, Video, Print and so forth markets.
14:50  LSD`: http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/libretto/W100 <- that wouldn't be too bad an idea for a multitouch iOS notebook or even a desktop at some point
14:50  acer_: I think in the future I will have a Mac to listen to music, watch some movies, maybe play some game and a Windows or Google or Linux PC to work.
14:50  Branes: acer_: Apple spent too many years securing several professional / vertical markets, they're not going to give them up. Even Steve knows that whilst being "the digital hub of your entertainment lifestyle" is important, there must be good machines to *create* that entertainment in the first place.
14:51  LSD`: I'll never use Linux for any kind of serious work again if I can avoid it. I'm over it.
14:51  acer_: Branes, yes. I agree with that. I just can't see where Lion helps on that.
14:51  Branes: This is why the future iOS Desktop will _still_ have all of the power and flexibility of OSX today. To get rid of *any* part of it is suicide, and Steve knows that.
14:52  acer_: If Microsoft buys Adobe for example, I tell you, I am donne with Apple.
14:52  Branes: acer_: Lion is the transition OS. It is to get people used to the idea of working with *some* of the iOS concepts, without losing anything we already know.
14:53  Branes: And iOS Desktop will not appear until it can do everything OSX can do for people.
14:53  acer_: Branes, I will wait and see. Maybe I will install Lion on an extra machine and see if it will help me to do my work. Lets the future talk.
14:54  Branes: In short, the desktop version will have a first interface very much like iOS on the iPad does today. Geeks and professionals won't want to use that (except for tsting, maybe) and will turn on all the 'power user' features.
14:55  acer_: Man, what was that Mission control thing?
14:55  Branes: Ten minutes to install iCode and re-enable Terminal, set Finder to auto-start on login, and you will be back in familiar OSX territory :)
14:56  acer_: I suspect when Steve anouced it he wasn't felling very confortable. I suspect it was a new generation idea.
14:56  Branes: Mission Control is a hybrid of Spaces and Exposé.
14:56  Branes: acer_: that would have been Steve's idea in the first place, as would be the stupid name he gave it :)
14:56  LSD`: Can you still disable spaces? :/
14:56 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
14:56  acer_: Mission Control relais on this new Magic Mouse gestures 100%, which I didn't apreciate at all to be honest.
14:57 * Branes thinks His Jobsness is starting to get a bit senile around the edges
15:05  FriedBob: Mornin'
15:06  ChrisAM: hi
15:07  ayaz: G'morning, FriedBob!
15:08  FriedBob: How goes?
15:13  iaj: hi there, folks 
15:13  iaj: how can I determine or change the basic OSX $PATH where binaries etc are looked up?
15:17  thoolihan: laj, determine with "echo $PATH" in Terminal.app, append at cmd line (or better yet in startup file like ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile with "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/additional/binaries"
15:18  iaj: thoolihan: will .profile be sourced any time?
15:18  ayaz: iaj: Also look at the `path_helper` utility and its man page.
15:18  iaj: every=any
15:20  Angostura: Branes: So what you end up, in the vision you describe, looks more like OS X with an iOS skin than iOS
15:20  thoolihan: laj, I usually explicitly source it in .bash_profile "source ~/.profile"
15:21  thoolihan: pretty good summary of what each file should do: http://stefaanlippens.net/my_bashrc_aliases_profile_and_other_stuff
15:21  iaj: thoolihan: hmmm but I want to have access to on whole OSX, not only in Terminal.app
15:21  Branes: No, it looks and behaves more like iOS, but it can do all the stuff OSX can do.
15:22  Angostura: Semantics, semantics. As long as it can do all the things that MacOS X can do, I'm happy
15:22  thoolihan: laj: yeah, that's why the article suggests PATH get set in .profile (available in and out of Terminal), and .bash_profile just ensures that it has been run for the current shell
15:24  Angostura: Branes: Do your sources suggest something will come along as a new successor to Cocoa? With Cocoa becoming the new Carbon?
15:24  iaj: thoolihan: so when I got export PATH=/Users/iaj/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
15:24  iaj: in my .profile.. MacVim should know about my PATH correct?
15:27  thoolihan: laj: I would think so, but I don't know much about vim or how it resolves paths.  You might need to do that in your .vimrc
15:27  thoolihan:  laj: looks like some examples here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2284556/how-do-i-use-variables-in-my-vimrc
15:59  LzrdKing: I poulled an HD out of my wife's old ibook and i want to clean it up to use it as a time machine disk but i don't want to delete everything incase she needs any files from it.  Is it safe to delete System, Applications and Library (both in / and in the user dir) folders?
15:59  zer0her0: LaraX: sorry had to run to a bunch of meetings and then errands before going to a friends for dinner
16:01  Syllopsium: What methods does everyone use for getting a PPC Mac to correctly do multihead graphics on CRT monitors..? I'm not getting the correct resolutions..
16:02  zer0her0: Syllopsium: i've never had a problem w/ a mac doing multihead
16:03  Branes: It's up to the card/GPU, Syll.
16:03  LzrdKing: anyone?
16:04  Branes: LzrdKing: Better to copy her user directory to another drive and then reformat it.
16:04  zer0her0: LzrdKing: time machine likes to wipe out everything on the HDD it uses
16:05  LzrdKing: zer0her0: it made a directory
16:06  LzrdKing: backups.backupdb
16:06  zer0her0: oh right on, and it didn't wipe out stuff on there?
16:06  LzrdKing: nope
16:06  zer0her0: sweet, then ya you should be able to delete system/application/library
16:07 * zer0her0 really needs to sit and spend time w/ the "newer" apple technologies
16:07  LzrdKing: but its putting 20GB on it right now and there's only 60GB free, but if i wipe out those folders i mentioned, i'll get another 8 GB free (its only 100GB to begin with)
16:12  zer0her0: gah, it's hard to to type, especially use keyboard shortcuts when missing a chunk of your thumb by the joint.
16:20  zer0her0: has there been any clarification if the app store will be the only way to install apps in 10.7?
16:20  zer0her0: (i doubt it, but coworker just asked)
16:20  LzrdKing: wow, lots of Permission denied when deleting Library/
16:21  Angostura: zer0her0: The Steve said both ways permissable
16:22  zer0her0: Angostura: thanks
16:22  zer0her0: i figured, but i suddenly had a moment of dread that they were going to just up and change stuff
16:22  LzrdKing: app-store-only for a computeR? that'd go over well
16:23 * LzrdKing makes sure he types "sudo rm -r Applications/" and not "sudo rm -rf /Applications"
16:24  zer0her0: heh
16:25  LzrdKing: err -rf for the forst one too
16:26  LzrdKing: first*
16:40  LzrdKing: woohoo! 74GB/100GB free on this disk
16:40  LzrdKing: thats good enough
16:55  Zed`: http://i.imgur.com/51f9p.jpg
16:55  zer0her0: Zed`: hahaha
16:55  Zed`: hehe
16:56  zer0her0: also, why does steve's smile look like a fake, i'm going to stab you when you're not looking smile while gate's smile is hey lets be friends smile
16:58  winegoddess: hi all. i just left the mac store andam heading back in an hour. they cant fix my mail. i get junk mail in my inbox, and real mail is going to spam. EEk.
17:01  Branes: http://tctechcrunch.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nocd.jpg - Apple abandon optical discs for their OS installation media.
17:02  zer0her0: that's hot
17:02  Tu13es: indeed
17:08  LzrdKing: are they using floppies?
17:11  CEnTR4L: How much storage in these thumb drives?
17:12  Branes: 16GB read-only, CEnTR4L.
17:13  zer0her0: hehe, ROM
17:13  zer0her0: just need a datajack in my head and i'd feel like i was in a gibson novel
17:14  Branes: zer0her0: You saw my mention of the Gibson-esque japanese pop star earlier?
17:14  zer0her0: no?
17:14  zer0her0: idoru?
17:14  Branes: William Gibson's "Idoru", Rei Toei, has a real-world counterpart. Watch Hatsune Miku in action: http://singularityhub.com/2010/10/20/this-rocking-lead-singer-is-a-3d-hologram-video/
17:16  Branes: Her form is computer generated and projected, and her voice is created using Yamaha Vocaloid.
17:16  CEnTR4L: My last history with thumb drives is 256 MB, I don't use them much as you can see, is there any brand/model you would recommend?
17:17  Branes: My order of preference: Sandisk, Corsair, Kingston
17:17  zer0her0: that's awesome
17:17  CEnTR4L: Do you have specific models for Sandisk & Corsair?
17:17  LzrdKing: they are all pretty much the same though
17:18  zer0her0: though I like the gorillaz more
17:18  zer0her0: but i guess they're not totally virtual
17:19  zer0her0: wow that hologram is really actually pretty amazing...
17:19  Branes: None in particular, Central; if you want ultra reliability, go SanDisk, if you want ultra-speed, go Corsair, if you want ultra-space, go Kingston.
17:20  zer0her0: Branes: do you know what projectors are running the show?
17:20  CEnTR4L: Thats terrific, thanks Branes!
17:20  Branes: No idea, zer0.
17:21  zer0her0: LIES!!!!
17:21  zer0her0: you know, TELL ME!
17:21  zer0her0: :)

17:54  bassliner: Millsie: i would use macports for that.
17:54  Millsie: macports is effort though
17:54  Millsie: I have a 1.6.13 dmg which'll do
17:54  Millsie: seems to work with my svn server version
17:55  LSD`: Do you absolutely need the most cutting edge latest svn or are you one of those Linux people who see a version number lower than the latest and froth at the mouth?
17:55  Branes: *snork*
17:56  zer0her0: LSD`: any version that isn't 0.x is to stable for me

17:58  zer0her0: :P

18:55  Marvolo: hmm danl that's interesting
18:57  Marvolo: is there any reason why that voice sings?
18:57  danl: It's one of the special voices
18:57  danl: but it matches my phones "droid" at boot perfectly

18:57  Marvolo: yah i recognize that from the commecials
19:00  antii: hm
19:00  Marvolo: If you make Cellos sing the alpahbet, the W messes it up. Too many syllables. 
19:01  antii: MBA 13" looks nice :]

19:20  CPng|N: monthly at least
19:21  Marvolo: Also don't keep it plugged in all the time. Discharge it to around 20% and then fully recharge it. 
19:21  Marvolo: whenever you can
19:22  CPng|N: 20? 
19:22  CPng|N: why not 0 to 2 or 3%
19:22  Marvolo: That's what I read
19:22  CPng|N: ie: full drain
19:22  Marvolo: you can do full drain monthly,
19:22  CPng|N: i've real full, and was told full but 2 different mac stores
19:22  Marvolo: but drop to 20% with normal use
19:22  CPng|N: oh
19:22  CPng|N: yeah
19:22  CPng|N: yeah ie don't keep charging after 2 hours of use

19:26  LaraX: zer0her0: it's ok
19:26  LaraX: danl: sorry, I just saw that
19:26  zer0her0: :P
19:27  LaraX: :P:P
19:27  zer0her0: hehe
19:27  zer0her0: so do i get a pic?
19:27  LaraX: oh yeah
19:27  LaraX: it came out really bad though, ask danl
19:27  LaraX: hold on
19:27  zer0her0: kk
19:29  LaraX: zer0her0: http://lh5.ggpht.com/_JwaDcvsde7o/TL9gnDtdL2I/AAAAAAAAAdI/rWo3QlW7MRQ/SanrioLogo.jpg I spent over an hour trying to get this to not come out blurry, was looking at settings, etc. I think my phone can't take close up pics
19:29  zer0her0: yea most camera phones won't do macro
19:29  LaraX: and it's metal and the phone and flash light kept showing up in the reflection
19:29  zer0her0: as macro really needs a good lense to do it
19:30  zer0her0: oh ok i do remember tha tlogo
19:30  zer0her0: and i thought it was an image of something else hahaha
19:30  LaraX: I have the logo on pens and pencils too but this pen/pencil box was the only flat thing I had so I thought it might come out better, maybe I should just scan it
19:31  zer0her0: naw it's ok, i remember that logo now
19:31  LaraX: something else like what? it's Badtz Maru
19:31  LaraX: ok
19:31  zer0her0: haha, no comment
19:31  LaraX: tell me! :p
19:32  zer0her0: we were talking about clothing items as well as logos.
19:32  stonith: Running a Macbook PRO Aluminum, MacOSX v10.6.4 ... really odd issue with a USB external keyboard.  When I hook it up and use it, not all the keys work.  Does anyone know how to fix this?
19:32  LaraX: oh yeah
19:32  zer0her0: LaraX: haha
19:32  zer0her0: stonith: what kind of keyboard
19:32  LaraX: I guess it could look like one of those
19:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
19:33  stonith: zer0her0: I'm using a Dell USB keyboard with some media buttons
19:34  zer0her0: oh the media buttons?
19:34  LaraX: zer0her0: well even if you recognize it, I still need to find a good pic of it online, or scan it or something, I want to get rid of these pens/pencils and am only keeping many of them because of that logo
19:34  LaraX: and danl needs to know how it looks to help me find it
19:34  zer0her0: haha ah i see what you're saying then yea scan would good, or any point and shoot camera that's relatively new should have a good macro mode
19:35  stonith: so this Dell USB keyboard was working at one time before, just fine.  I think an OS update kind of messed it up possibly.
19:35  danl: LaraX: this made me think of you: http://i.imgur.com/0Sfsd.jpg
19:35  danl: I can see you doing that
19:35  LaraX: you can scan any flat object right? even if it's raised, as long as the flat side is touching the scanner. hopefully the reflection from the metal and light won't be a problem there too
19:36  LaraX: lol danl, I would
19:36  LaraX: hahaha
19:36  zer0her0: LaraX: next time i am down in the city I can take a pic of it if you want
19:37  LaraX: zer0her0: you come to NYC?
19:37  zer0her0: I live 2 hours away, and my family still lives just north of the city
19:38  LaraX: see this pic was taken with the same camera, I don't get it: http://lh6.ggpht.com/_JwaDcvsde7o/TMB6Y_OaTTI/AAAAAAAAAdM/sDb3hlNshns/HelloKittyShowerCurtain.jpg
19:38  zer0her0: LaraX: what don't you get?
19:38  LaraX: I used the high quality setting like last time but I don't remember how I got this bigger
19:38  LaraX: because this one is so much bigger and clearer
19:38  zer0her0: cause you're not as close
19:38  zer0her0: the lense isn't designed for a focal length that short
19:39  LaraX: but I sent this to my phone with bluetooth and yesterday I emailed it to myself
19:39  LaraX: ok so maybe it's blurry, but why is it so small too?
19:39  zer0her0: that i have no idea
19:39  zer0her0: hehe
19:39  LaraX: yeah I don't know what I did differently besides how I sent it to myself, I don't think I changed settings
19:40  LaraX: danl: that's hilarious, where did you find it? or was it your conversation?
19:41  LaraX: zer0her0: what kind of camera phone or camera do you have?
19:41  LaraX: danl's phone takes good pics

19:46  zer0her0: doubt it'll ever get 212 #s
19:46  zer0her0: can cell #s even use 212?
19:46  LaraX: probably not but we might be able to port it in the future
19:46  LaraX: I think so
19:46  zer0her0: heh, back in the day we had to use 917
19:47  LaraX: I thought 212 #s were hard to get until I found out Verizon has many
19:47  LaraX: zer0her0: my cell phone has been 917 since I first started using them and got Sprint in 1998... I really want to change it
19:47  zer0her0: yep

19:52  danl: my area code is from where i lived two area codes ago
19:52  zer0her0: Jean Reno and Christopher Walken FTW
19:52  zer0her0: my area code is from space
19:52  LaraX: is wikipedia blocked too?
19:52  zer0her0: no
19:52  zer0her0: i looked at the map
19:52  LaraX: ok
19:52  zer0her0: i still never seen a 646 #
19:52  zer0her0: i lived in/around NYC for 20 years
19:53  LaraX: what about 347?
19:53  danl: zer0her0: my domain was never blocked for you before
19:53  zer0her0: i think a couple times, but can't recall anyone i know having one
19:53  zer0her0: danl: i'm kidding
19:53  danl: oh
19:53  zer0her0: just wanted you to stab bash
19:53 * danl stabs bassliner 
19:53  danl: oops
19:53  zer0her0: hahahahaha
19:53  zer0her0: awesome
19:53 * danl stabs bashusr twice for the mistake he made
19:53  zer0her0: i almost pointed at him too
19:54  LaraX: this would be a good time to show zer0her0 a pic of me so he can't see it :p
19:54  zer0her0: yes
19:54  zer0her0: you should
19:55  LaraX: it's not like you'd remember to look at it later, like that other link I sent you last time!
19:55  zer0her0: hahaha :(
19:55 * zer0her0 cries
19:55  LaraX: I don't even remember what it was now
19:55  LaraX: lol
19:55  zer0her0: me either
19:55  zer0her0: haha
20:09  zer0her0: that is always cool to see, scientist watching bones in our bathroom sink
20:12  zer0her0: w/ a toothbrush
20:21  LaraX: huh?
20:21  zer0her0: haha
20:21  FriedBob: zer0her0: watching or washing?
20:22  zer0her0: washing
20:22  FriedBob: Though, if you had a TV actually IN the sink, that would be cool
20:22  LaraX: lol
20:22  zer0her0: oh maybe i'll do that for my next art piece
20:22  FriedBob: danl: You ever do any mods for Morrowind?
20:22  LaraX: just don't open the water...
20:24  zer0her0: open...the...huh?
20:24  zer0her0: ;)
20:25  FriedBob: LaraX: It'd have to be fully functional or it'd not be too cool, IMO
20:25  zer0her0: there are water proof screens
20:26  LaraX: FriedBob: I don't think getting electrocuted is too cool though
20:26  zer0her0: it's hella cool
20:26  LaraX: oh really
20:26  zer0her0: yes
20:26  LaraX: do you lick batteries too?
20:27  zer0her0: the best part is getting hit w/ a chair to disconnect you from the power source
20:27  LaraX: I see...
20:27  zer0her0: stupid shorting knife switches
20:30  LaraX: [21] 03:51:57 AM <danl> You can also use the Move to Folder button (folder icon with down arrow)
20:30  LaraX: danl: I don't see this?
20:30  LaraX: looking...
20:31  LaraX: oh

20:33  LaraX: danl: you have email btw
20:42  LaraX: zer0her0: you told danl Picasa was blocked? the link I showed you was from Picasa Web Albums
20:42  memenode: My MBP is so slow..
20:43  zer0her0: weird
20:43  Tu13es: mine was slow, i formatted and reinstalled and everything is wonderful again
20:43  zer0her0: our proxy is wierd
20:43  zer0her0: certain stuff works
20:43  Tu13es: i was tempted to buy more RAM, but i don't need to anymore
20:46  memenode: Tu13es: how much RAM does yours have?
20:46  Tu13es: memenode: 2gb
20:46  memenode: hm same as mine
20:47  memenode: I'm gonna get more RAM though, but if it can be faster even with this.. I wonder why would formatting and reinstalling help..
20:47  memenode: That reminds me of windows.. reinstalling as maintenance :P
20:47  Tu13es: it was almost 2 years since i had last reinstalled
20:47  Tu13es: and i've installed pretty much every piece of software ever written
20:48  Tu13es: it could have been just one specific thing slowing eveything down, but i didnt care to troubleshoot
20:48  memenode: shouldn't matter if you didn't run any of the installed stuff
20:48  memenode: though yeah, there could be some processes..
20:48  memenode: hiding in there
20:48  memenode: I might do that..
20:53  Tu13es: i do like starting fresh after a while
20:53  Tu13es: with disk space too
20:57  memenode: yeah, I do that all the time with Ubuntu on PC :)
20:59  CPng|N: there's nothing quite like wasting time

21:12  topriddy: so steve beginning to show is true anti-java colors mscheew
21:13  zer0her0: topriddy: ?
21:14  Tu13es: zer0her0: ?
21:14  zer0her0: Tu13es: !
21:14  topriddy: he has deprecated java in future mac os x releases and thats very irritating
21:15  zer0her0: topriddy: he depreciated APPLES JVM, not java.
21:15  zer0her0: this could be because 1) Apple is getting rid of Java Engineers(doubtful) 2)Oracle has requested Apple to stop doing this(more likely)
21:16 +Berzerker: I hate Java anyway
21:16 +Berzerker: who cares
21:16  Angostura: zer0her0: Or Steve just has a bee in his bonnet 
21:16  zer0her0: I like Java as a language, sadly JVMs generally suck
21:16  topriddy: enterprise software developers care
21:16  CPng|N: I'm not even sure Oracle gives a crap about Java
21:16  CPng|N: (or anything realy)
21:16 +Berzerker: Oracle saw some money and jumped in it
21:16  zer0her0: Angostura: why would he suddenly after all this time randomly start hating java
21:17  CPng|N: Oracle is more of an acquisition company than a quality software company
21:17  zer0her0: Oracle/Sun on the other hand has had alot of power shifting and has even gone after Google for Java related stuff
21:17  topriddy: zer0her0: he hinted his dislike for java in past
21:17  CPng|N: acquisition/lawsuit-happy
21:17  Tu13es: I, for one, welcome our new java overlords
21:17  zer0her0: In the past Sun was ok w/ Apple making it's own JVM(something that was pretty rare at the time)
21:17  Tu13es: but seriously, at least the java version will be somewhat up to date now
21:17  Tu13es: for a while it was way way behind
21:18  zer0her0: agreed, Java is so wonky on Mac anyway
21:18  zer0her0: i mean it's generally pretty smooth but it's generally version lagged
21:18  Tu13es: yep
21:18  CPng|N: a better thing would be a quality replacement
21:18  zer0her0: agreed
21:18  CPng|N: but I don't think things like python and sucha re up to it
21:18 * zer0her0 punches this DMG in the face
21:19  topriddy: how about a situation oracle doesn't pick development of java jdk on mac? then we are left with open source implementations which most times use X11 which isnt particularly *fine* on mac
21:20  zer0her0: topriddy: what if MS stops making Office for mac?
21:20  zer0her0: what if the world implodes?!
21:21  CPng|N: why does java need to use x11?
21:21  zer0her0: CPng|N: but WHAT IF!!!!
21:21  CPng|N: I KNOW HUH
21:21  CPng|N: heh
21:21  CPng|N: I better start pre-worrying
21:21 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
21:22  topriddy: zer0her0: who cares?
21:22  zer0her0: but i'm worried about worrying
21:22  zer0her0: topriddy: i understand it's a warning sign, and something to watch
21:22  zer0her0: but i wouldn't be concerned w/ it
21:22  zer0her0: getting rid of java would break too much stuff
21:23  topriddy: well  i pride myself a java developer and at least mac/apple should provide me 1st class support and integration for java software development
21:24  LaraX: zer0her0: maybe because your proxy only has some of the Picasa Web Albums domains blocked, I think there are different ones
21:25  zer0her0: haha, in response to this DMG not mount coworker says "that just points to the fact it's beer-thirty"
21:25  zer0her0: LaraX: yea prob
21:25  zer0her0: topriddy: personally Apple should provide me 1st class espresso's and foot rubs
21:26  Tu13es: at least
21:27  LaraX: Apple is your girlfriend now?
21:27  zer0her0: LaraX: wait, GF are required to do this?!
21:27  LaraX: I don't know :)
21:27  zer0her0: :P
21:28  LaraX: they can combine a Mac with an espresso and massage machine
21:29  LaraX: or at least make apps for it
21:29  zer0her0: haha
21:29  remyo: zer0her0: Well if you're not dating Apple can I?
21:29  LaraX: Apple is mine!
21:30  zer0her0: o.O ruh roh
21:30  LaraX: ok I can share it
21:30  zer0her0: oh lala
21:35  remyo: Is the new Air already in Apple stores?
21:37  remyo: Was thinking about hitting one up this weekend and checking it out
21:37  CPng|N: let us know
21:37  remyo: Will do
21:37  LaraX: yeah let me know too
21:38  LaraX: they said available today (yesterday) right?
21:38  LaraX: I still need to watch that video again
21:38  remyo: Something like that. But I don't know if they rolled them out in the walk-in stores yet
21:39  zer0her0: i'm going tonight i'll let  yall know tomorrow
21:39  remyo: Sweet
21:39  LaraX: ok
21:39  LaraX: zer0her0: are you getting something?
21:40  zer0her0: can i msg you?
21:40  zer0her0: LaraX: 
21:40  zer0her0: forgot that
21:41  LaraX: oh yeah sorry, try again
21:42  spline: mac+coffee == good time @ coffee shop
21:43  spline: "Cawfee" for the newyorkers who retain the accent
21:43  Tu13es: zer0her0: can i msg you?
21:43  zer0her0: Tu13es: no
21:43  zer0her0: sure :)
21:43  sr0z: Tu13es: can i msg you and ask about my mac pc?
21:43  Tu13es: zer0her0: ok just wondering
21:43  Tu13es: sr0z: no
21:43  spline: zer0her0: dmg not mounting? 
21:43  sr0z: :(
21:43 * zer0her0 waits
21:43  zer0her0: spline: we were given a damaged dmg
21:44  remyo: spline: Which coffee shop?
21:44  spline: oh
21:44  zer0her0: waiting for the dept to get us a new copy
21:44  spline: nevermind
21:44  spline: not much you can do about that
21:44  spline: remyo: oh I just mean going to a coffee shop with one
21:44  remyo: Oh, thought thats what you were doing :p
21:44  spline: I have a big "apple" sticker they give with laptops on my mini9 (its black) so I get asked
21:44  spline: nah I was two days ago 
21:45  spline: my local one does awesome espresso and gives free wifi
21:45  remyo: That was my former occupation. Working in local coffee shops. 
21:48  spline: oh must have been fun
21:48  spline: the staff at mine is really nice and they are trained well to do good drinks
21:48  spline: and, run as a non-profit by a local church
21:49  zer0her0: it's just really a front to sell smack to kids, don't lie spline 
21:49  topriddy: hello guys, been googling and trying to understand the way to go about sending a location info(lat,long) info to google maps or anywhere else and get the reverse geocoding...I get lost in the google map documentation easily and wondered if anybody had tried something similar in the past
21:49  remyo: spline: I actually kind of miss it.
21:50  remyo: I don't miss only making $8.50 an hour. But I miss the people, how easy everything was.
21:51  zer0her0: remyo: sell smack on the side
21:51  zer0her0: it's a win win
21:51  spline: remyo: they started doing sandwiches there at mine and now do pizza
21:51  spline: moved from the coffee and beyond, and have done really well
21:52  spline: I promote them whenever I can + do all my business meetings there unless its lunch where im doing sushi at the local bistro
21:53  oxi: hi
21:53  LaraX: hi
21:53  oxi: is it possible to squash 256gb of a 13'' MBA into a 11'' MBA?
21:54  oxi: I'm interested in the new MBA, but I'm not going to buy it until 256gb fit into it
21:54  oxi: 128gb is definitely not enough
21:54  Tu13es: you can't do any squashing
21:55  Tu13es: so if apple doesn't have it listed, it's not doable
21:55  Tu13es: if that's what you're asking
21:55  ChrisAM: the SSD is soldered onto the board, isn't it?
21:55  zer0her0: hi
21:55  Tu13es: ChrisAM: sorta, iirc
21:55  crilly: hello
21:55  zer0her0: is it possible to fit a PB&J in the MBA Logic board
21:55  Tu13es: it's not like a normal 2.5" or 1.8" drive
21:55  Tu13es: zer0her0: yes of course
21:55  zer0her0: cause sometimes i get hungry
21:55  Tu13es: it's peanut butter jelly time, peanut butter jelly time
21:55  zer0her0: and i'd love to have like a snack attack pack in that beast
21:56  crilly: i want to fit the internals of my Mac Pro into my Casio calculator case please help!
21:56  crilly: zer0her0: how are you my pretty?
21:56  remyo: spline: Pizza at a coffee place?
21:56  zer0her0: sexi as ever for you.  how you?

21:57  crilly: remyo: why not?
21:57  crilly: get those little trendy pizzas now
21:57  spline: remyo: they only do lunch. the coffee shop is open 6-6 daily
21:57  crilly: kind of like an oval shape about a slive size
21:57  spline: its to help themmake  a little more money. They've done well but wanted to expand the coffee shop
21:57  zer0her0: wait it's a church coffee shop that's open 666 daily?
21:57  spline: and margins are much better on the non-coffee stuff I was told
21:58  oxi: Tu13es: ok - thanks

21:58  LaraX: LaraX: can I msg you?

21:58  Kasm279: o.O
21:58  Tu13es: oxi: oh, sorry, i didn't finish my thought. but basically yeah, it's onboard and it can't be upgraded.
21:58  spline: LaraX: +g block you from msging yourself?
21:58  crilly: LaraX: can i msg you?
21:58  Kasm279: i should get a poly mac mini and fit it inside something
21:58  zer0her0: LaraX: can i msg me?
21:58  Kasm279: maybe into the xbox :D?
21:59  LaraX: spline: not sure but it does block me from versioning myself! let me check
21:59  spline: I can haz msg?

22:00  ErrantEgo: yes?
22:00  ErrantEgo: no?
22:00  LaraX: it let me version myself this time but hasn't other times, maybe it depends on the client? and let me PM myself too
22:01  LaraX: [21] 04:00:21 PM <LaraX> test
22:01  LaraX: [21] 04:00:21 PM <LaraX> test
22:01  oxi: I find that onboard memory a little crazy
22:01  crilly: ErrantEgo: Balance?
22:01  remyo: spline: I'd just never heard of that before. We used to do all kind of food where I worked at but never pizza.
22:01  ErrantEgo: crilly: yes - between left and right channels
22:01  crilly: ErrantEgo: oh
22:01  remyo: Interesting is all
22:01  spline: remyo: they got an oven and get ingredients from a local place, I think
22:01  LaraX: zer0her0: no you can't msg yourself
22:01  oxi: they must be very confident, that the memory lasts for a long time
22:01  LaraX: crilly: depends... :p

22:02  crilly: LaraX: ooh on?
22:02  crilly: ErrantEgo: first hit on Google
22:02  ErrantEgo: yie.
22:02  spline: remyo: they get the free-trade stuff or whatever its called
22:02  ErrantEgo: what the hell.
22:02  spline: lemme find out
22:02  Kasm279: bah
22:02  Kasm279: crash
22:02  Tu13es: oxi: long enough for applecare to expire, at least :P
22:02  spline: All of our coffee is organically grown and Fair Trade certified. Our coffee and espresso beans are freshly roasted by

22:03  LaraX: crilly: whether or not I let someone msg me deoends on a few things... but mostly it should be about something private/important/short and that I know the person. sometimes guys I don't even know want to talk in private all day about everything, or just want to PM to flirt, etc
22:03  LaraX: depends*
22:03  remyo: spline: I know what you're talking about. The place I worked at had a roaster in the back and when we weren't serving coffee upfront we'd ship it around the world to various coffee places
22:04  LaraX: and I'm bad at multitasking
22:04  remyo: The ones that didn't roast their own
22:04  Kasm279: anyway

22:09  LaraX: there are minors on IRC? besides like one or two
22:09  CPng|N: well take yourself to jail
22:09  zer0her0: haha
22:09  remyo: spline: Yep. Tis what I'm doing now. 
22:10 --- londonmet050_ is now known as londonmet050
22:10  CPng|N: shame on your
22:10  crilly: bashusr: hey big man :)
22:10  CPng|N: I suppose you were watching R movies too
22:10 * zer0her0 just realized he's double that age now
22:10 +bashusr: double age!
22:10 +bashusr: crilly: can you interview richardcavell?
22:10  crilly: old man now zer0her0 
22:10 +bashusr: he's never on when i am on
22:10  zer0her0: double age! FINISH HIM!
22:10  zer0her0: crilly: i am i am.
22:10  crilly: bashusr: ha! sure thing
22:11  crilly: zer0her0: You've got an iPhone right?
22:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +o bashusr]
22:11 --- bashusr has changed the topic to: Welcome to ##mac! | Channel rules: Play nice, no hackintosh & English only | Register @ http://ircmac.com/ | DIY @ http://iFixIt.com | We're looking for OPs in the Asia/Australia regions - richardcavell: PM crilly | http://xkcd.com/612/
22:11  zer0her0: crilly: i have a couple none w/ me now
22:11  zer0her0: why
22:11  crilly: zer0her0: OK. I want to see if WhatsApp works internationally.
22:11  zer0her0: ah i'll try to check tonight
22:11  crilly: That's right, you will x
22:12  zer0her0: yes sir
22:12  crilly: I love that xkcd in the topic
22:12  crilly: it was genius of me to put it in there
22:12  zer0her0: heh
22:13  crilly: bashusr: I assume you've checked the basics, such as the fact he;s in Asia and been in here long enough?
22:13  zer0her0: crilly: i've had the beginning of this convo before: http://xkcd.com/806/
22:13  crilly: I don't think I've ever spoken to a richardcavell
22:13  zer0her0: but it was w/ actual BeOS back in '01
22:14  ErrantEgo: ok, what changed in the topic?
22:15  zer0her0: oh crap ErrantEgo has caught on
22:15  zer0her0: abort! abort!
22:15  ErrantEgo: *GASP!*
22:15  ErrantEgo: ;)
22:15  crilly: zer0her0: haha love it
22:15  crilly: ErrantEgo: a request for richardcavell to PM me naked pictures
22:15  crilly: in ascii
22:16  ErrantEgo: :D
22:19  crilly: We need a "voicemail" bot in here for the OPs. Send thr bot a message for someone and the bot relays it once that person comes online. I could probably write that in Python in 3 minutes.
22:23 --- kateweb_ is now known as kateweb
22:24  crilly: zer0her0: Got any shell accounts I can borrow to host a Python script? :D
22:26  FriedBob: Grrr. Synergy is connected, but not working.
22:27  Tomis: for mac to mac, i use teleport FriedBob 
22:28  FriedBob: Win7 as server, G4 PB as client
22:29  Tomis: darn
22:29  LaraX: crilly: I think his host says .au
22:29  Tomis: synergy is the only thing i know of to do that
22:29  FriedBob: Tomis: It's worked beautifully for years
22:29  LaraX: [21] 04:29:23 PM -NickServ- Last addr  : ~richardca@115-64-151-98.tpgi.com.au
22:29  crilly: LaraX: Good. I think I remember him
22:30  crilly: I wonder if that Python bot woukld work? hmm
22:30 * crilly gets hacking
22:30  LaraX: zer0her0: how can you type if you hurt your finger that badly?
22:34  FriedBob:  Tomis Ihad to reboot windows to get it working. :(
22:35  Tomis: aint that always the way FriedBob 
22:36  spline: crilly: nickserv does memos
22:36  spline: has for a while 
22:36  spline: unless they took that away
22:38  crilly: spline: can't see anything in the help
22:39  crilly: spline: there's a MemoServ :D
22:40  spline: that's it
22:40  spline: and tons of bots like supybot, varous other ruby/python
22:40  spline: even eggdrop
22:40  spline: all do it
22:40  spline: no need to reinvent the wheel
22:41  crilly: It's about the learning curve my friend.
22:42  crilly: And if I needed a bot that simply took down messages and spat them out when the user came online/joined the channel, I would write something my self for the simple fact an EggDrop or any other bot would be massively overkill for such a simple task.
22:42  crilly: I need to get back into Python again.
22:48  crilly: oooh new MBA
22:48  crilly: £850
22:49  crilly: I wonder if a MBA would be a good option over an iPad?
22:50  Tomis: if you can suffice with an ipad, then a MBA would be disapointing
22:50  Tomis: it's bigger and bulkier in comparison
22:51  crilly: true, but it's still very slim and light. I think I'll check out the 11" version next week see what's it's like
22:52  ChrisAM: it will be expensive.
22:52  crilly: Tomis: I want to wait for an iPad update before considering one.
22:52  crilly: ChrisAM: It's £850
22:52  crilly: Starting price.
22:52  crilly: I would love to get my mum one.
22:52  Tomis: yea, probably a good idea
22:52  Tomis: wait for the camera and high res display
22:52  Tomis: i wouldn' be surprised if they hold off on the high-res display until gen 3
22:53  crilly: Tomis: I would love to see a retina display on one. I think that would make me get one.
22:53  crilly: oh
22:53  crilly: does anyone here use AutoHotkey in Windows?
22:54  crilly: Tomis: I'm moving towards more portability in everything I do now, really. I would love a MBA to carry around with me just because.... well because I could because it fits inside my arse.
23:03  S_SubZero: crilly: they already make a netbook for that. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiNaadVOQEM
23:04  CPng|N: Ass OS
23:06  crilly: haha
23:06  crilly: ninja video editing skills
23:17  Tomis: i've no idea why that should make me want to buy their laptop S_SubZero 
23:17  Tomis: guess it's supposed to be that wacky viral marketing thing or something
23:18  crilly: Tomis: Something about getting it in the anus from a black man does it for you I guess.
23:20  CPng|N: careful don't upset zer0her0
23:21  crilly: :P
23:21  crilly: I wish I took more photos of... everything.
23:21  crilly: I have about 4 photos on my facebook. I have a friend hee with nearly 5,000 photos.
23:27  atmosx: crilly: 5.000 pictures? hmmm not a bad idea. iPhoto has storage issues, I mean after a while you need an external HD to store pictures. If facebook gives space for free, why not...
23:27  atmosx: privacy comes at a price, but if you decide that it's okay ehehe
23:28  crilly: To be honest, I would use a Flickr account if I had that many photos.
23:28  atmosx: is that free also?
23:28  atmosx: yes flickr is photo-oriented
23:28  atmosx: much better
23:29  Kasm279: i should get flickr pro so i cna get all of my images archived here
23:29  FriedBob: Depends on what you want to do with it, really.
23:29  FriedBob: I use picassa web and also facebook for mine, dependng on who I want to share them with
23:30  LaraX: I like Picasa Web Albums because it's part of my Google Account, but it's annoying that you can't rename pics or have the file name show up under the pic
23:30 * crilly agrees with FriedBob 
23:31  crilly: I'd use Facebook for silly photos like being out on the town and stuff, but Flickr for the more serious stuff like travel photos etc.
23:32  LaraX: unless you make the file name the caption which I've been doing
23:32  spline: I thought you could rename?
23:32  spline: I keep mine in iphoto then export via there
23:33  LaraX: how? I can't figure it out
23:33  spline: I don't think I've ever done it
23:33  spline: now that I think of it
23:33  crilly: I find iPhoto is REALLY slow for me
23:33  LaraX: I upload it directly from the desktop to there
23:33  crilly: I hardily have anything in there, but it's slow moving around, importing from the iPhone, etc
23:33  LaraX: to rename it you have to save the pic again, rename, then reupload :|
23:33  crilly: Slow starting up.
23:33  spline: well I only have about 2GB of photos.. most of my DSLR stuff is sitting in my archives so I don't have lots of photos anymore
23:33  crilly: I have less than 20 photos.
23:34 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
23:35  crilly: I'm not sure iLife '11 will be something worth upgrading to to be honest.
23:36  sileni: if i have coding questions about ios what channel should i visit?
23:36  bratskanq: HELLO mac
23:36  crilly: sileni: #iphonedev or something
23:38  bratskanq: MAC! 
23:38  crilly: What?!
23:38  bratskanq: can we talk about hardware?
23:38  crilly: Anything you want buddy.
23:39  bratskanq: what's your favorite mac?
23:39  antii: Big Mac
23:39  antii: HRHR
23:39  crilly: I've only experience the one I have no, my MBP 13" 2009.
23:39  crilly: now*
23:40  crilly: I wouldn't mind an iMac though and a Macbook Air.
23:40  antii: MBA 13"!
23:40  crilly: MBP at the girlfriend's, MBA on the road, iMac at home.
23:40  bratskanq: original imac?
23:40  antii: If i get the 2GB version, I can't upgrade the ram afterwards on the air?
23:40  LaraX: sileni: or #ipaddev (not sure if they're # or ##)
23:40  crilly: antii: No idea.
23:40  crilly: bratskanq: No new model
23:41  antii: crilly: I heard the only easy way is too choose 4gb ram while buying from apple
23:41  crilly: antii: the MBAs look difficult to deal with when it comes to after market upgrading
23:41  antii: yes :(
23:42  crilly: I think you mgiht needs ants to unscrew things.
23:42  antii: But i heard that the ram was not available to get too on the new mbair
23:43  Tomis: there are no aftermarket upgrades on the MBA
23:43  crilly: I would just invest more at the time of purchase and get from Apple so it's done and dusted.
23:43  Tomis: afaik the ram is soldered to the board, as is the flash storage
23:43  crilly: it wouldn't surprise me
23:43  crilly: they need all the space they can get
23:43  antii: Tomis: :(
23:43  Tomis: i say that based on looking at the internal pics
23:44  bratskanq: i like the old imacs
23:44  Tomis: if you want something with upgradable ram/hd get the macbook
23:44  antii: Tomis: thats bad imo.. if warranty goes out and something crashes
23:44  bratskanq: i wish it didnt cost so much to ship the crt inside
23:44  Tomis: then you buy a new one antii 
23:44  Tomis: welcome to disposble electronics
23:44  antii: haha
23:44  crilly: Or get Applecare
23:44  bratskanq: i don't like macs since intel and osx. will i be ok here?
23:44  antii: crilly: nothx
23:44  antii: suppose i have to wait for a new MBP then :-D
23:44  Tomis: it's still OS X bratskanq 
23:44  crilly: By the time that runs out, it won't matter because you won't be cool anymore because you have an old Mac and thus, you will kill your self.
23:45  Tomis: they changed the CPU arch, what diff does it make
23:45  bratskanq: they should have bought BEos 
23:45  Tomis: no
23:45  Tomis: they made the right choice
23:45  LaraX: spline: if you figure out how to rename it let me know
23:45  Tomis: they got steve, and didn't go down in flames
23:45  antii: MBP 13" seems so more worth now
23:45  bratskanq: if you say so
23:45  bratskanq: all of my macs are old
23:45  crilly: antii: I have a MBP 13". Lovely little machine.
23:45  thedonvaughn: i just put netbsd on my old macs
23:45  Tomis: the MBP line really only starts at he 15" model
23:46  spline: LaraX: try clicking on the name like how you rename in Finder
23:46  crilly: I want 4GB in it and a 500GB HDD.
23:46  Tomis: the 13" is just a macbook in a pro case
23:46  spline: I think this works
23:46  jeffmr: old macs are great
23:46  antii: I want the 13"
23:46  antii: Or 15" with hires
23:46  thedonvaughn: i like the 13" in size better.  but I love my 15" MBP.  icore5,8GB of ram, 500GB hard drive, hi-res anti glare display.
23:46  LaraX: spline: what name? it doesn't even show up unless you make the file name the caption which I've been doing
23:46  Tomis: i got the 15" with a nice rebate
23:46  Tomis: base model 15" 1599
23:46  Tomis: up'd the HD to 500GB 7200
23:47  antii: eh
23:47  antii: thats cheeeeee
23:47  antii: p
23:47  Tomis: i'll up the ram in a couple years when it's cheeper
23:47  jeffmr: I sold my previous one on ebay and got the rebate for the new one from that
23:47  jedivulcan: I love my 15" machine.
23:47  bassliner: seriously, i don't care as long as i can open a terminal and am online.
23:47  antii: Tomis: thats what im paying for 13" mbp in my country
23:47  Tomis: look around antii 
23:47  Tomis: never pay apple's retail price
23:47  antii: Tomis: I pay 10000 SEK for MBP 13" with standard specs from apple.se
23:47  spline: LaraX: hmm
23:47  Tomis: you can always find some deal from one of the resellers
23:47  antii: we got no refurbished ones here
23:47  antii: Tomis: never seen :(
23:48  Tomis: damn
23:48  jeffmr: where are you anti?
23:48  Tomis: take a vacation to the US then and smuggle one back with you!
23:48  antii: jeffmr: Sweden
23:48  Tomis: heh
23:48  antii: i would :<. the dollarz are so low now
23:48  antii: almost worth going there :D
23:48  jeffmr: doesn't anyone ship internationally?
23:48  bassliner: and actually i think the 13 mbp is the mac to go if you don't know what kind of mac fits your needs.
23:49  antii: bassliner: mmh, glossy screen, crap resolution
23:49  Tomis: if you don't know, then the macbook or the ipad will probably suffice bassliner 
23:49  bassliner: antii: you could go for a mac pro with the 30" cinema display if that fits better.
23:49  Tomis: most people do jack-all with their machines
23:49  crilly: I got my MBP 13" on finance (£18/m), so I will clear what's left and then look at a new toy on finance again.
23:49  crilly: not sure what to get though.
23:49  antii: bassliner: no
23:49  Tomis: email, web, some office
23:49  Tomis: play a movie maybe
23:49  bassliner: Tomis: most ppl don't even get close to the possibilities their machines give them.
23:50  Tomis: exactly
23:50  Tomis: i'm doing dev work and my machine sits mostly idle most of the time
23:50  Tomis: 2 physical cores, 4 virtual
23:51  antii: :)
23:51  crilly: I don't use the full potential of my MBP. I do a lot on it, a lot of different things, but I don't make the CPU sweat :P
23:51  Tomis: feel like i need to find some heavy processing to do with it just to put it to good use, heh
23:51  antii: Tomis: if I find a great deal on the mbp 13" i might get it
23:51  crilly: Tomis: Folding@Home or something
23:51  bassliner: Tomis: i develop stuff on a 1ghz thinkpad with 2gb of ram. excellent machine. small, extremely robust and rock solid, runs linux absolutely smoothly, ergonomic as hell, excellent keyboard. and i paid 1/5 the price i'd pay for a new mbp 13".
23:52  Sebboh: Hi.  I would like to upgrade OSX on a Mac Mini.  I took a picture of the hardware info: http://twitpic.com/2zlnpk ... It has 10.3 on it.  Are there any free upgrades available?  What about paid upgrades?  What is the newest version that will run on this hardware?
23:52  crilly: bassliner: Yeah but it has linux on it
23:52  bassliner: crilly: which is exactly what i want when i seriously do work.
23:52  CPng|N: mac mini should be able to run 10.6.4 no?
23:52  crilly: each to their own, but "work" and "Linux" never did fit into the same sentence for me.
23:53  CPng|N: oops nevermind
23:53  antii: Tomis: Dont u think the MBP wont get a update soon? :<
23:53  CPng|N: they had mac mini's with PPC G4's? I r confuzed
23:53  bassliner: crilly: then you probably have a, uhm, excuse my language, retard job.
23:53  bassliner: crilly: or you're a graphician or musician, but i'm pretty sure you don't get paid for writing code.
23:54  crilly: So if you're not a programmer, you're a retard?
23:54  jeffmr: Sebboh, http://lowendmac.com/mini/mac-mini-g4-jan-2005.html
23:54  crilly: That's an interesting theory.
23:54  bassliner: crilly: from the point of view of a programmer, probably. yeah. :)
23:54  bassliner: crilly: no you're not a retard i think.
23:54  crilly: bassliner: OK, well in that case I think you're more retarded for believing that.
23:54  CPng|N: linux is not just for programmers
23:54  bassliner: crilly: i mean i love to do photoshop on a mac, while i could also use it on a windows machine.
23:55  crilly: bassliner: I get the feeling you're more of a troll than anything.
23:55  bassliner: crilly: if you think so, good for you.
23:55  jeffmr: Sebboh, it looks like 10.5 and all updates for any .x are free
23:55  crilly: But not good for you.
23:56  crilly: So, drop the assumption that you're better than everyone else because you're a programmer (you're probably crap), because you really aren't. You've made a fool of your self, in fact.
23:56  Sebboh: jeffmr, thanks for the link!
23:56  jeffmr: sure
23:56  bassliner: lol
23:56  bassliner: crilly: i never said that.
23:56  bassliner: crilly: i just said i wouldn't want to have to write code on a mac.
23:57  crilly: Well you did, but we're not going to discuss it anymore.
23:57  Sebboh: crilly, you started it.  Let the user have linux on his/her thinkpad.  You complained, remember?
23:57  Tomis: no one uses linux
23:57  Tomis: it's just a myth
23:57  Tomis: like jesus, or the financial system
23:57  Tomis: it's not real
23:57  crilly: Sebboh: So? I have the right to express my opinion - it's just my opinion wasn't offence or abusive.
23:58  crilly: I didn't verbally abuse everyone (everyone outside of the programmer circle) because I find it difficult to code on a Mac (I don't, I've found it easier than most other OSes).
23:59  Tomis: i dont know what you guys are arguing about, but whatever it is, you're both on the internet, so you're both wrong
23:59  crilly: well yeah, but my ePenis is massive so NER
23:59  bassliner: Tomis: actually i'm pretty sure that much more than 95% don't even know about the possibilities of what a terminal with a bash shell could give them. i mean macs could easily be equipped with a bsd style ports system and you can use it almost like a fully fledged unix workstation, it's sad that so few ppl know about this.
