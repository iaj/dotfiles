00:24  Swian: not me
00:25  atmosx: roku or wd tv live?
00:25  Kasm279: atmosx: i own an XBMC
00:26  atmosx: Kasm279: XBMC?
00:26  Kasm279: yeah
00:26  Kasm279: well, XBMC4XB
00:26  atmosx: on what hardware?
00:26 * Kasm279 points to big blck computer packaged as a video game on desk
00:27  atmosx: okay, that's not an option
00:27  atmosx: :-P
00:27  atmosx: HTPC's are the best, I bet on it
00:27  atmosx: but I need something that feets under the TV has an idiot-proof menu and "just works"
00:28  atmosx: I'm trying to figure out if boxee is worth the money, because where I am, I can't rent movies from netflix, itunes or hulu
00:28  atmosx: rent movies or have content streamed (video content)
00:28  Swian: where are you
00:28  atmosx: Greece

00:42  atmosx: which HW are you talking about?
00:42  Kasm279: an Xbox
00:49  atmosx: oh, that's an xbox?

01:35  torchie: i love how all the "apple tablet" concepts are completely off the mark
01:36  atmosx: is the iPad off themark?
01:36  atmosx: and theiPhone?
01:36  atmosx: wtf is ON the mark then?
01:37  Fedayk1n: I love how osx 10.6 has ps3 controller profiles built into the bluetooth profiler
01:38  torchie: atmosx: as in when everybody drew up these concepts they were widely off of what the ipad actually turned out to be
01:38  atmosx: torchie: so... what's your point?
01:38  atmosx: Steve Jobs said that even he didn't know "how it's actually going to be"
01:39  torchie: u mad?
01:39  atmosx: so ... Apple had just  a great idea, it's up to you to turn into a gaming machine or a digital magazine
01:39  atmosx: are you?

02:14  gucko_: it's definitly correct!
02:14  gucko_: I'm using ssh!
02:14  MrUnagi: no!!!
02:14  gucko_: I allowed the ports on my router
02:15  MrUnagi: do you get a password prompt
02:15  Branes: see if you can log in without ssh
02:15  gucko_: MrUnagi: yes I do
02:15  gucko_: MrUnagi: then I enter them, but I get that they're wrong
02:16  MrUnagi: if you get a prompt it isnt ports
02:16  gucko_: Branes: I'm logged using Terminal ssh
02:16  MrUnagi: gucko_: are you trying to login to host.local or user@host.local
02:17  gucko_: MrUnagi: I'm just clicking on the icon appeared on side in Finder
02:17  MrUnagi: i thought this was ssh
02:17  gucko_: MrUnagi: I can connect to ssh easily..no problem
02:17  gucko_: but it's only with AFP
02:18  MrUnagi: is afp enabled?
02:18  gucko_: MrUnagi: yeah sure
02:18  gucko_: MrUnagi: I followed the tutorial exactly
02:18  MrUnagi: is your user allowedf?
02:18  gucko_: MrUnagi: yes
02:19  gucko_: will check again
02:30  gucko_: MrUnagi: my user is allowed to use the home folder and another folder. Should i allow the user to use the afp in general somewhere else?
02:34  MrUnagi: should just be the folder you are trying to share
02:34  MrUnagi: what happens when you put in your password?
02:34  gucko_: MrUnagi: I get that it's wrong

02:45  zzing: I have an SD card that I can't seem to write to or erase, is there any way of figuring out why?
02:49  sanduz2: can someone tell me if Mac OS X supports all the stuff that Linux does since its Unix? for example some python scripts tell me i need to have lib-whatever installed. is this sort of thing supported?
02:49  pgpkeys: install macports or fink
02:49  zzing: sanduz2: too general of question
02:49 --- K2a7s9m is now known as Kasm279
02:49  pgpkeys: then use the ports to install whatever is missing
02:49  zzing: I would advocate homebrew since it uses as much built in mac stuff
02:50  pgpkeys: homebrew has way less packages than macports
02:50  pgpkeys: i've used both. macports has more
02:51  sanduz2: hmm interesting 
02:51  sanduz2: pgpkeys, so macports should have all the stuff i would normally find with apt huh?
02:51  pgpkeys: sanduz2: both probably will. both have python2.x and python3.x
02:52  pgpkeys: but yea, macports will have the greater likelihood of having packages
02:52  sanduz2: well the python thing was an example but like all the open sources libraries and command line tools and stuff is what im really interested
02:52  sanduz2: i want OS X for a unix experience but i want to also use those pro apps like photoshop
02:53  sanduz2: so it would work just like it does in linux? thats very cool
02:53  pgpkeys: well osx IS unix. what you're rally after is general linux packages ported to osx
02:53  pgpkeys: yeah. not everything out there will work of course. but there is a very large port base
02:53  Fedayk1n: what tools?
02:54  sanduz2: right. so lets say you install a linux app, does it get an icon and stuff in the applications folder?
02:54  pgpkeys: nope
02:54  Fedayk1n: most if its there already.  for whats not theres macports
02:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraX]
02:54  Fedayk1n: does it get an icon in X?
02:54  Fedayk1n: usually nope
02:54  pgpkeys: what fedayk1n said. but macports installs to /opt (/opt/local/) no icon for the install
02:54  sanduz2: gnome puts it in the menu usually
02:54  Fedayk1n: thats not to say you can't build your own alias in /applications
02:55  pgpkeys: well tahts linux. this isn't linux
02:55  sanduz2: interesting
02:55  pgpkeys: you're trying to make 2 different OSs work hand in hand with each other
02:55  Fedayk1n: and gnome != linux
02:55  Fedayk1n: gnome is gnome
02:55  sanduz2: no im just wondering how they intersect
02:55  pgpkeys: no really?
02:55  pgpkeys: you know damn well what i meant
02:55  pgpkeys: not gonna play semantic games
02:55  Fedayk1n: I was letting him know that
02:55  Fedayk1n: not you
02:56  pgpkeys: then i'll apologize for the snarkiness
02:57  sanduz2: does Mac OS X generally have the open source libraries linux has like lib-python-dev9827-whatever? im sorry for being so vague 
02:57  Fedayk1n: 's ok :)
02:57  sanduz2: or is that something you generally have to pick up from macports?
02:57  pgpkeys: not always named exactly as such
02:57  Fedayk1n: sanduz2: depends  some it does, some it doesn't
02:57  pgpkeys: but you can port search blah and then sudo port install blah
02:57  sanduz2: hmmm okay
02:57  MrUnagi: my son != quiet
02:57  sanduz2: sounds interesting
02:57  Fedayk1n: like python isn't a general package
02:57  Fedayk1n: its usually an optional
02:58  pgpkeys: oh my usb drive AND my harddrive blitzed itself today
02:58  Fedayk1n: need to keep your cats away from your media :)
02:58  pgpkeys: just finished a reinstall and now finished copying off my backups from the usb drive so i can reformat it
02:58  pgpkeys: hehe
02:58  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: hope you have backups
02:58  pgpkeys: mrunagi: that WAS my backups
02:59  MrUnagi: so then you have your originals
02:59  MrUnagi: :D
02:59  pgpkeys: i've lost about 40GB but thankfully I was able to recover the rest
02:59  pgpkeys: now its just reformatting the usb drive and then pushing it all back
02:59  MrUnagi: i like being backed up
02:59  pgpkeys: me too
02:59  MrUnagi: though, my external and my backup differ in size reported
02:59  MrUnagi: that makes me nervous
03:00  MrUnagi: rsync -n reports a bunch of spotlight stuff......but can that really be 30 gigs?
03:00  pgpkeys: metadata most likely
03:01  MrUnagi: can that really equal 30 gigs?
03:01  MrUnagi: brb
03:01  pgpkeys: depends on how much you have on your system. could also be system cached stuff
03:04  sanduz2: are any of you guys former linux users who switched to Mac?
03:04  pgpkeys: hyes
03:04  pgpkeys: err yes
03:04  sanduz2: whats your opinion and experience with that, pgpkeys ?
03:06  pgpkeys: loving it
03:06  pgpkeys: challenges thrill me
03:06  Fedayk1n: sanduz2: yeah
03:06  sanduz2: mac is challenging?!
03:06  pgpkeys: sanduz2: uh yeah
03:06  Fedayk1n: I like os x better
03:07  Fedayk1n: took a while to adjust to differences tho
03:07  pgpkeys: challenging in it does things differently than linux does
03:07  Fedayk1n: there's a good book
03:07  sanduz2: what kind of work did you guys do on linux? im a developer myself
03:07  pgpkeys: not everything but enough to be fairly unique
03:07  Fedayk1n: yeah it does things the bsd way :D
03:07  pgpkeys: fedayk1n: I also ran freebsd so its not so bad to handle
03:07  sanduz2: oh i love bsd, its a shame its so under supported
03:07  pgpkeys: few things have gotten me but not many
03:08  Fedayk1n: was my desktop for 5 years, and I tend to get stuck on the admin ropes of webservers running it
03:08  MrUnagi: .Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Stores/E2FF1ED0-6806-47B5-B1D5-4E29025650AA/live.1.indexUpdates<---------is meta data correct?
03:09  sanduz2: pgpkeys and Fedayk1n, what kind of work did you guys do on linux? are you guys developers?
03:09  pgpkeys: yes. i'm a new developer. i did a lot of admin work during times i wasnt in the military
03:09  Fedayk1n: sanduz2: systems admin, and used it as a desktop for years and some development
03:09  sanduz2: i see
03:10  MrUnagi: my sexternal has 706.8GB but the backup has 721.48GB
03:10  pgpkeys: yeah linux was my desktop usually. only reason i ran windows was for some windows programming and games
03:10  pgpkeys: other than that i was always in linux
03:10  MrUnagi: wow...i said sexternal...
03:10  sanduz2: what do you guys miss from linux and what do you like better in OS X? sorry for being a pain, its hard to find linux users switching to OS X
03:11  sanduz2: and it will be a big investment for me :P
03:11  Fedayk1n: sanduz2: http://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-X-Unix-Geeks/dp/0596003560
03:11  Fedayk1n: those tend to be good books
03:11  Fedayk1n: I like better that shit just works :)
03:11  sanduz2: lol
03:11  Fedayk1n: no kernel voodoo, or dep hunting
03:11  sanduz2: oh that book looks very interesting thank you
03:12  Fedayk1n: I can just relax and use my system,  not work on it so I can use it
03:12  Fedayk1n: there are lots of books on teh unix of os x
03:12 --- Tua_Scoot_ is now known as Tua_Scoot
03:13  sanduz2: yea i wanted to switch to OS X because its still unix but theres lots of support and pro apps and stuff
03:13  Fedayk1n: honestly.  if you wanna give it a go on the cheap,  you've 2 options
03:13  MrUnagi: os x is less maintenence
03:13  Fedayk1n: pick up a mini,  or hackint0sh
03:14  Fedayk1n: if you're really on the fence,  I'd google up hackintosh, spend a month with it, then I'm pretty sure you'll start picking out your mac
03:15  Swian: I went with a mini to keep cost down
03:15  MrUnagi: Fedayk1n: that is the path i took 
03:15  sanduz2: cool thanks :)
03:15  Fedayk1n: just remember that its against the EULA, and not really legal
03:15  MrUnagi: now i have 3 macs
03:15  Fedayk1n: yeah I got a mini, now I have a few macs
03:16  MrUnagi: there.....my backup matches my external
03:16  MrUnagi: i dunno what it deleted, i dont wanna think about it
03:16  Fedayk1n: MrUnagi: just yer pr0n
03:16  MrUnagi: i dont have any.......thats what the internet is for
03:16  Fedayk1n: hehe
03:20  pgpkeys: hrmm ok i'm confused. why does mac osx always use extended partitions? does it not support making primaries?
03:20  pgpkeys: I was going to try and make 2 primary partitions rather than an extended with 2 logicals in it
03:20  pgpkeys: but disk utility seems to only make extended+logicals
03:21  pgpkeys: unless i'm misunderstanding what Extended means under OS X

14:59  chris_99: hi chaps, does anyone know a way to automount an ext2/3 partition 
15:00  chris_99: on startup
15:00  chris_99: i've got the fuse-ext2 app, which works fine from the terminal
15:00  chris_99: in linux i'm used to the /etc/fstab file
15:01  chris_99: but OSX doesn't seem to have one?
15:03  MrUnagi: so you are able to mount using fuse
15:03  chris_99: yep
15:03  chris_99: am just trying to find a way for it to do that for me
15:03  chris_99: at startup
15:04  MrUnagi: add a script to login items
15:05  chris_99: 'login items'?
15:05  MrUnagi: settings > accounts > select the user > login items > + > select the script 
15:06  BobbyJr: I do believe you can create the fstab file under OSX to do what you want, theres quite a bit of documentation on the net for doing things like that
15:06  chris_99: MrUnagi, cheers i'll check that out 
15:06  BobbyJr: I recall it was necessary for modifying the way ntfs volumes are mounted
15:06  chris_99: theres a file called /etc/fstab.hd, but it says its ignored in the file itself
15:06  MrUnagi: yea thats what i saw chris_99 
15:06  MrUnagi: honestly, writing the script isnt that big of a deal
15:07  chris_99: yeah that would be pretty easy
15:13  MrUnagi: anyone excited for verizon ipad 2? :D
15:15  chris_99: verizon ipad?
15:16  chris_99: i was reading something about how they think the resolution will probably double
15:16  elmer_jfudd: I am excited to see info regarding iPad2.  Verizon doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies :/
15:25  MrUnagi: verizon makes me feel warm and fuzzy
15:25  MrUnagi: do you think verizon iphone can be jailbroken to sprint.
15:27  elmer_jfudd: I've had the iphone for over 2 years.  Honestly I am not interested in Verizon, ATT, Sprint, or even jailbreaking.  I'd like to see the current iPhone be allowed to be used on TMobile
15:28  MrUnagi: tmobile sucks too =)
15:32  elmer_jfudd: all carriers suck to some extend.  I like tmobile's pricing
15:32  MrUnagi: i like being able to use my phone :D
15:33  elmer_jfudd: I have 2 iphones.  Been on att for over 2 years.  Never had a problem using my phone
15:34  MrUnagi: must live in a good area
15:34  MrUnagi: and never travel ;)
15:36  fujisan: MacWorld ;d
15:49  MrUnagi: anyone good at bash?
15:52  MrUnagi: nevermind i got it :D
15:58 --- MrUnagi_ is now known as MrUnagi
15:58  MrUnagi: i suck at bash
16:04 --- MrUnagi_ is now known as MrUnagi
16:06  MrUnagi_: yay it works :D
16:07  gucko: hi guys
16:07  MrUnagi_: hi
16:07  gucko: I still have problems with my AFP server on ubuntu. I still get that the username and password are wrong. Any ideas please? I can't log in :(
16:08 --- MrUnagi_ is now known as MrUnagi
16:10  MrUnagi: no idea =/
16:11  MrUnagi: if you can log in over ssh, then why not use sshfs?
16:12  MrUnagi: gucko: ^^
16:12  gucko: MrUnagi: what's sshfs?
16:13  MrUnagi: mounts ssh as a filesystem
16:14  gucko: MrUnagi: how to do that in OSX?
16:14  MrUnagi: install macfuse and macfusion
16:14  gucko: do I need to install anything on ubuntu?
16:15  MrUnagi: no
16:22  MrUnagi: gucko: got it workin yet?
16:27  MrUnagi: gucko: ?
16:27  gucko: still working on it...
16:27  gucko: 5 mints ;)
16:29  MrUnagi: k
16:29  MrUnagi: i use it on my system to access a remote server
16:35  gucko: MrUnagi: it works great :)
16:35  MrUnagi: cool
16:35  gucko: MrUnagi: but should I use FTPSF or sshfs?!
16:35  MrUnagi: sshfs
16:36  gucko: yeah I used that. But how to make it always on the side in Finder?
16:36  gucko: should I always run the app and click Reveal?
16:36  MrUnagi: thats all i do
16:38  gucko: so there's no way to put an icon in Finder or on Desktop to just double click it?
16:38  MrUnagi: i dunno if there is no way, i just havent had a need
16:39  gucko: man it's really great!
16:39  gucko: it's as if the disks are connected to my laptop!
16:39  gucko: simply WOW
16:40  CaBa: hi
16:40  MrUnagi: hi
16:40  CaBa: how can i compile a C-program in 64 bit on 10.6 such that it also runs on 10.5?
16:41  CaBa: with gcc
16:42  CaBa: i'm using a C-library fuer java 6, i used to simply build a 32-bit version for 10.5 with java-5, but java-6 on 10.5 doesnt support 32bit mode
16:42  Roadwins: Iemand Nederlands toevallig?
16:58  dimm: hello! can i use my imac as internet router for another PC with bluetooth adapter?
16:58  MrUnagi: what in the world would you want to do that for?
17:00  dimm: i meant "can mac os x 10.6 sharing internet via bluetooth?"
17:00  MrUnagi: i dunno, dunno why anyone would want to
17:02  dimm: MrUnagi: faq :)
17:02  MrUnagi: that would be incredibly slow.....
17:15  MrUnagi: dimm: is this for your own setup?
17:16  Cam: Hi MrUnagi 
17:16  MrUnagi: hi
17:16  Cam: I just used CC last night, and OH MAH GAWD. it was amazing.
17:16  Cam: *CCC
17:16  Cam: Can I set it up to put it on my FTP server?
17:17  MrUnagi: i believe it does it over ssh
17:17  Cam: >.> darn.
17:17  MrUnagi: is ssh a problem?
17:17  Cam: My box has only 30GB of space and my FTP server has about.... 500
17:19  MrUnagi: and you cant use ssh on the 500gb server why?
17:21  MrUnagi: Cam: ^?
17:21  Cam: It's FTP only..
17:21  Cam: Just hosting.
17:22  MrUnagi: oh it isn't your server?
17:22  gucko: MrUnagi: I found a way :D
17:22  MrUnagi: gucko: ciik
17:22  MrUnagi: s/ciik/cool
17:22  gucko: guys does anybody know a place to get nice volume icons?
17:22  Cam: MrUnagi, the 30gb is a box i have root on, the ftp server is a hosting plan I have and it is NOT on my server, I have NO permissions to do anything other than host.
17:23  gucko: or even where can I find the icons of OS X so I can use them?
17:23  MrUnagi: gucko: http://interfacelift.com
17:24  MrUnagi: Cam: dunno my man.....ftp isnt secure, i wouldnt recommend it anyway
17:25  Cam: MrUnagi, the dmg is password protected.
17:26  MrUnagi: ::shrug::
17:29  MrUnagi: cam might try mounting the ftp as a fs and then rsync
17:30  chris_99: you might be able to use FTP SSL to make it more secure

17:30  MrUnagi: what layer does ssl operate on
17:31  chris_99: its an application layer protocol isn't it
17:31  MrUnagi: probably
17:31  MrUnagi: presentation
17:31  gucko: MrUnagi: how to show hidden folders/files?! i.e what starts with "."
17:31  MrUnagi: gucko: same as any finder windows, which i dont know, never needed to
17:32  Cam: MrUnagi, it has SFTP too, sorry I didn't mention that
17:32  gucko: anybody please?
17:32  MrUnagi: cam sftp operates over ssh, so it would probably work Cam

17:33  chris_99: if you can use sftp use that
17:33  chris_99: its _far_ more secure than FTP
17:33  Cam: Nope, I lied. SFTp doesn't work :P
17:33  chris_99: heh
17:33  Cam: The locked DMG will have to do
17:33  MrUnagi: Cam: if you are hell bent on using ftp, then mount the ftp as a file system and rsync
17:33  Cam: MrUnagi, why?
17:33  MrUnagi: so you can back up to your ftp?
17:34  Cam: I don't care if someone snags this dmg, it has a 25 letter password in 2 languages.
17:34  Cam: If they get it, they deserve it!
17:34  MrUnagi: i am not giving you a secure option
17:34  MrUnagi: i am telling you how i would try to backup to an ftp server
17:34  Cam: I'm just using my ftp client.

17:35  CaBa: anyone about compiling with -m64 on 10.6 so that it can also run on 10.5?
17:35  Cam: gucko, ls -a [path]
17:36  gucko: Cam: I want to do it in Finder :S
17:36  Cam: You will have to run a command in terminal first..
17:36  MrUnagi: gucko:  defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
17:36  Cam: OR, you can use this http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/hiddenfiles.html , gucko 
17:36  Cam: MrUnagi, ^ more user friendly :)
17:37  MrUnagi: how hard is it to copy and paste into the terminal?
17:37  Cam: MrUnagi, most people hate the terminal.. my solution is better for those people.
17:37  MrUnagi: heh
17:37  Cam: I on the other hand only use the terminal because finder SUCKS.
17:37  Cam: And I don't EVER *EVER* touch my mouse.
17:37  MrUnagi: i have no quarrels with finder
17:37  Cam: Branes has "finder sucks" as a highlight... wait for it!
17:38  MrUnagi: i wrote a script to connect to my server that detects whether i am at home or not, then connects locally or over the net depending on if i am or not at home
17:39  MrUnagi: how cool am i
17:39  Cam: MrUnagi, 500 files in a folder, make a new folder with ONLY the mp3's in the original finder. GO!
17:39  Cam: I can do that in... 5 seconds in terminal, but it will take you a while (automator lmfao)
17:39  MrUnagi: i dont need to do that...
17:39  MrUnagi: but then im not an expert on bash yet
17:39  Cam: I'm just saying, the shell is more powerful than finder
17:40  simplicity-: 1) sort by kind. 2) shift+mouse click in the start of MP3. 3) shift+mouse click i the end of MP3.
17:40  simplicity-: Easy :D
17:40  Cam: cp [path]/*.mp3 [newpath]/
17:40  MrUnagi: shell is always more powerful....finder isnt meant for power users
17:40  MrUnagi: simplicity-: i thought the same thing
17:40  Cam: Where is sort by kind?
17:40  MrUnagi: but i wasnt sure that i understood the scenario
17:40  MrUnagi: Cam:  in the finder
17:40  Cam: I don't see it..
17:40  MrUnagi: your finder is broken
17:40  CaBa: is there a separate mac development channel?
17:40  simplicity-: because you removed it.. It's there by default.
17:40  Cam: Nope..
17:40  simplicity-: CaBa, #macosxdev
17:41  CaBa: simplicity-: thx
17:41  simplicity-: Sure is, Cam.
17:41  Cam: Watch.
17:41  Cam: http://cl.ly/460T201k3S2T3b0Q0T0m
17:41  MrUnagi: im trying to write a recursive renaming script by hand....havent done it yet
17:41  MrUnagi: change the view..
17:41  simplicity-: That view is not the default view.
17:41  Cam: Oh god no... the other views are HORRIBLE. You can't travel through files with your keys.
17:41  MrUnagi: or click the cog > arrange by > kind
17:42  MrUnagi: sure you can
17:42  simplicity-: cmd+o and backspace.
17:42  simplicity-: Easy.
17:42  Cam: Gross.
17:42  MrUnagi: control command 5
17:42  MrUnagi: bam! sorted by kind
17:42  simplicity-: shit, backspace doesn't work :D
17:42  MrUnagi: simplicity-: mine works
17:42  simplicity-: Okay, my finder is broken then :D
17:42  MrUnagi: no no
17:42  Cam: http://cl.ly/0R1I3B0y3l2h2M0A2r0i
17:43  MrUnagi: control command 5
17:43  Cam: Where is the size there?
17:43  MrUnagi: change views
17:43  Cam: simplicity-, the point is that using finder limits speed and performance.
17:43  Cam: MrUnagi, This was my default.
17:43  MrUnagi: but you wouldnt see it on directories anyway
17:43  simplicity-: Well.. For a newbie it doesn't. They'd use more time navigating the terminal.
17:43  Cam: fair enough
17:44  MrUnagi: it just comes down to...to each their own...but dismissing the finder because you didnt find a way to do what you want is lofty
17:44  Cam: MrUnagi, no it's not. If it doesn't support me, it's gone.
17:45  Cam: I will not use software that cannot do what I want.
17:45  MrUnagi: and i can respect that, but your reasoning was flawed
17:45  Cam: No it's not.
17:45  chris_99: MrUnagi to recursively move mp3s -   find *.mp3 | xargs -I {} mv {} /Test/mp3s             might help you?
17:45  MrUnagi: i can do what you said that i couldnt
17:45  MrUnagi: chris_99: maybe, i was trying it with a conditional statement with sed in a variable....
17:45  chris_99: are you trying to move specific files?
17:45  MrUnagi: chris_99: that wouldnt do it for directories too
17:46  Cam: chris_99, mv *.mp3 /newpath/
17:46  MrUnagi: chris_99: well im not really needing it for anything, i am just trying to learn bash, so i was trying to come up with a script to do it without looking it up
17:46  chris_99: thats non recursive CaBa 
17:46  MrUnagi: i think im giving up on it lol
17:46  chris_99: *Cam
17:46  Cam: Who said recursive?
17:46  chris_99: scrollback ;)
17:46  Cam: chris_99, you're not reading this right.
17:47  Cam: I said terminal was better, he said finder was better. The original question was ONE folder, no recusive searching / moving.
17:47  chris_99: i'm not talking about what you said
17:47  MrUnagi: cam there are 2 different conversations
17:47  Cam: Ok
17:47  Cam: Talk to you all later.
17:47  chris_99: MrUnagi, said he he wanted to move files recursively via the CLI
17:47  Cam: MrUnagi, step 2, delete finder.
17:47  MrUnagi: not even just for .mp3 but any file with a space, make it _
17:48  MrUnagi: and folders
17:48  chris_99: ok, so you want to move anything with a space?
17:48  MrUnagi: pretty much
17:48  MrUnagi: which is why i was trying to do it with a variable with sed
17:48  MrUnagi: but i dunno what i am doing
17:48  MrUnagi: lol
17:49  chris_99: try:           find "* *" | xargs -I {} mv {} /DumpHere
17:49  MrUnagi: ah ok here is where i get tripped up i didnt know you could name another variable
17:50  MrUnagi: for FILE in 'find . -type f'; do NEW='echo $FILE | sed -e 's/\ /_/''; mv "$FILE" "$NEW"; done
17:50  chris_99: oh i misread you, you want to change ' ' to _
17:50  MrUnagi: yea
17:53  MrUnagi: that would work
17:53  MrUnagi: and i understand that bash lol
17:55 --- gucko_ is now known as gucko
17:55  gucko: guys what should be the extension of the image for MacFusion to change the icon?
17:56  gucko: using .ico didn't work!
17:56  MrUnagi: guck get info, drag and drop the icon
17:57  MrUnagi: for FILE in $(find .); do echo $FILE; done outputs each part of the folder name as a separate output
17:57  MrUnagi: i.e. space name folder is 3 items.....did i miss an operand in the find?
18:00  gucko: MrUnagi: Man I can't change the icon!
18:01  chris_99: MrUnagi: you need $(find) in quotes like "$(find)";
18:01  MrUnagi: gucko change it in macfusio
18:02  gucko: MrUnagi: it doesn't accept it
18:02  MrUnagi: ah chris_99 
18:02  gucko: I don't know why
18:02  MrUnagi: .ics
18:02  MrUnagi: er
18:02  MrUnagi: not in finder
18:03  MrUnagi: there it goes
18:03  MrUnagi: did you change it in macfusion?
18:03  gucko: yeah
18:03  gucko: but it doesn't accept it
18:03  MrUnagi: where doesnt it accept it
18:04  gucko: for example: when i try to locate it, the open button still not activated
18:04  MrUnagi: you lost me
18:04  gucko: or even when I drag and dropped, nothing happens
18:04  gucko: When you click Choose in MacFusion
18:04  gucko: a Finder window appears to locate the icon
18:05  MrUnagi: you mean reveeal?
18:05  gucko: no no
18:05  gucko: in MacFusion, click the mount disk and then Edit
18:05  MrUnagi: you cant edit after mounting
18:05  gucko: then click the MacFusion tab
18:06  MrUnagi: ok yea im there
18:06  gucko: yeah I unmounted it before I do that
18:06  MrUnagi: then choose
18:06  gucko: yeah then choose
18:06  MrUnagi: then choose the icns
18:06  gucko: when I locate it, then the Open button is still not active
18:06  MrUnagi: is it an icns?
18:07  gucko: I downloaded them from interfaceleft
18:07  MrUnagi: but is it an icn
18:07  MrUnagi: icns
18:07  gucko: I can't find an extension
18:07  gucko: yeah
18:07  gucko: icons
18:07  MrUnagi: are you sure you downloaded it for the right os?
18:07  gucko: yeah
18:07  gucko: can you try?
18:07  MrUnagi: mine works...

19:01  leobr: hello everyone
19:01  leobr: i got a macbook pro, and its not booting everytime
19:01  leobr: iv tryed reinstalling eopard, it cals for a reboot, but dont get into  the system, aftter loading i got a forbidden like sign in ths screen and it freezes
19:02  Branes: That can either mean you are installing off the wrong DVD, or there is a hardware fault with the machine.
19:02  leobr: is there a pre boot diagnostic I can run to test it?
19:03  Branes: You'll need the original grey-labeled DVDs that came with the machine. On the second disc there is a hardware test partition.
19:04  leobr: well, we recently moved, got no cds
19:04  Branes: Find the DVD with the legend telling you it has the Hardware Diagnostic on it, boot from that DVD and hold the Option key down until you see icons on the screen -- choose Hardware Test, and follow the prompts.
19:04  leobr: can i do this test without the cds?
19:04  Branes: That's the only way to do a hardware test, short of taking it into a service-point or Genius and letting them run it. You can't do it without the DVDs.
19:05  leobr: i cant download them also i presume
19:05  Branes: Nuh-uh. You can buy a replacement set cheaply, though.
19:06  leobr: I see. was on the urge to recover it, have to wait for monday then
19:06  Branes: Ring the Apple support line for your country, give the operator your MacBook Pro's serial number and for about US$25 they will post you a replacement set of the discs that came with that machine.
19:06  leobr: i got other macs here, do they cds might work for this hw test?
19:07  Branes: Grey-art OSX discs are always machine-specific.
19:07  Branes: You would need to have the discs from exactly the same model and generation.
19:10  leobr: well, it booted now, it showed me the choose backup source for recovery
19:10  leobr: but i got none
19:11  leobr: only choice is to go back
19:12  leobr: im in brasil, too expensive mac support
19:12  leobr: :D
19:13  Ava_: Omnom
19:14  leobr: is there a comand i hold at boot or something?
19:15  Branes: Not really -- you really do need to find that laptop's original discs, or get another set sent to you.
19:16  Branes: (for the fifteen quintillionth time, I wish Apple would put the OS installer files on a ROM inside the Mac so that people are not crippled if they lose their discs)
19:17  leobr: how i wish
19:27  leobr: is there a way to force cd eject without entering the system?
19:30  pokerl: hi
19:30  g4bittin: hi
19:33  pokerl: anybody got commandline skills in here ... ?? need to change display settings display not correctly working
19:38  Angostura: pokerl: What's up with them?
19:38  Angostura: Safeboot (holding shift down at startup) may help perhaps
19:39  pokerl: more ideas ... anyone?
19:42  Angostura: pokerl: YOu still haven't actually described the problem
19:43  Angostura: "settings not working correctly" isn't very illuminating
19:43  Angostura: is this  a resolution problem? Why can't you use the PrefPane, etc.
19:44  Angostura: Have you deleted the plst?
19:56  ziro`: hi, i'm having trouble adding a bin to my executable path
19:56  ziro`: i've created a symbolic link to my /usr/local/bin dir but it doesnt seem to pick it up
19:56  ziro`: is that the right thing to do?
19:58  ziro`: fs, ok, i just eneded to restart my bash session

21:31  dassouki: does any else experience extreme lag in typing in word 2011 ?
21:33  simplicity-: When i work in a +30 pages document, yes.
21:33  simplicity-: Sometimes help killing the "WindowServer" process i found. (Notice it'll kill your session)
21:33  dassouki: what's the downside to killing my session?
21:34  simplicity-: You'll just need to login, relaunch everything etc.
21:34  dassouki: I find it mostly whe nI add equations to my document
21:34  dassouki: ok
21:34  simplicity-: I'm not sure it'll work for you, tho.
21:35  dassouki: why not
21:36  simplicity-: Just saying.
21:36  simplicity-: It was kinda random here. i just noticed it started eating alot of memory, and found that it helped killing it.
21:39  dassouki: simplicity-: ooh ok. This scucks though :( 
21:40  dassouki: my process manager indicates that safari is using most of my memory with 250 mb (only 2 tabs open) and word with 143 mb. I have 4gb ram and 64mb video ram
21:41  dassouki: could it be that i'mrunning a 32 bit office on a 64 bit computer?
21:45 * _nada_ Hey!
21:46  Keshi: dassouki: It has probably got do with Safari's plugins. Thirty-two-bit programmes use 32-bit registers and things. In general that means they will use less memory but will get less done per clock of the CPU. I do not think that would have anything to do with why Safari is using more memory than office though. Office's use of memory would obviously increase depending on what you load using it too.
21:46  Keshi: Hello _nada_.
21:46  _nada_: :D
21:47  Keshi: Bullfrog is such awesome game. It is just awesome!
21:47  dassouki: Keshi: ok thanks, i just shut down Safari, I'll see if i notice any improvements.
21:49  Fedayk1n: dassouki: its probably facebook, and flash :)
21:53  dassouki: well i have a pdf open, gmail, and occasional reddit session
21:54  Keshi: Yup, a webbrowser is more of a platform for applications now, than a normal programme.
21:54  Keshi: It has to do with what you are using it for, not Safari I reckon.
21:54  Fedayk1n: yep
21:54  Fedayk1n: that pdf takes up a lot of memory,  gmail does as well
21:55  Fedayk1n: lots going on there
21:55  torchie: the internet is the final frontier
21:55  dassouki: ok well i shut er down .. and still word is slow
21:56  Fedayk1n: which version of word?
21:56  Keshi: What version of word is it?
21:56  Fedayk1n: what what kinda mac you have

21:57  Fedayk1n: on a 4g processor?
21:57  Fedayk1n: its going to be slow
21:57  dassouki: yup can't afford a new macbook so i just upgraded the ram 
21:57  dassouki: it's corde 2 duo
21:57  dassouki: core
21:57  dassouki: core 2 duo 2 ghz .. 4gb ram
21:58  dassouki: see my vram says  VRAM (Total):64 MB of Shared System Memory .. i wish i can extend that to at least 256 mb
21:58  jedivulcan: MacBook 2,1 ~ a 2006-07 MacBook with a GMA 950 Intel graphics.
21:58  jedivulcan: You can get up to 144mb in bootcamp.
21:58  dassouki: but i don't want bootcamp
21:58  jedivulcan: It's not configurable on the Mac OS X side as far as I know.
21:59  jedivulcan: I don't blame you. I hate bootcamp.
21:59  jedivulcan: Just pointing out that the vram can be user configured.
21:59  dassouki: ya it's a mid 07 model
21:59  dassouki: ya i know that that the vram could be user configured, and i scoured the internet to find a way
22:00  dassouki: there was one way, but it seemed to tap into the system internals and didn't want to mess with that
22:00  Fedayk1n: its going to tap into the system internals to increase your video ram buffer
22:01  dassouki: ya
22:02  dassouki: i'm gonna see how it deals with a 50mb word file
22:03  Fedayk1n: its going to cry
22:04  dassouki: will the i5 ever come to the macbook pro 13 inch
22:04  Fedayk1n: the i5?  maybe

22:13  ubijtsa: dassouki: Fn+arrow up or arrow down.
22:15  dassouki: ubijtsa: i know but for some reason word doesn't bind it that way
22:15  ubijtsa: dassouki: ah, that's Word being broken then. Maybe it has some internal settings for keybindings.
22:16  ubijtsa: I would not know.. OOo or Pages/Numbers/Keynote for me.
22:16  dassouki: Pages and Numbers are good for small scale stuff
22:16  dassouki: but once you get into pivot tables, shared 3dcharts
22:16  dassouki: and documents written by 10 ppl at the same time
22:16  dassouki: pages fails miserably 
22:22 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v richardcavell]
22:22  ubijtsa: dassouki: my gripe with the Apple tools are - no open-document import/export..
22:23  ubijtsa: I can live with that for the time being though. I am hoping that iWork 2011 will rectify this deficiency
22:23  dassouki: ubijtsa: in my world (producing transportation models) we're as closed as closed can get
22:24  dassouki: i don't mind close formates
22:24  dassouki: Ms office just works. the same way my iphone just works and my macbook just works
22:24  jedivulcan: Me neither. I save my stuff in Pages and use iWork all the time.
22:24  dassouki: another gripe with pages and OOo is the styling mechanisms. I'm a styling nazzi
22:25  ubijtsa: heheh
22:25  dassouki: as in I'm the kind of guy who has built templates around styles, each heading has to be a specific way, footer, header, and so on. With word, I can have a style defined with 20/30 different styles, nd automatically switch between them
22:25  torchie: style!
22:26  torchie: if you're gonna get office just save the headache and place your face directly on microsoft's crotch
22:26  dassouki: office is the last of my worries
22:26  dassouki: TransCAD <-$20,000
22:26  dassouki: ArcGIS <-$5,000
22:27  ubijtsa: torchie: *lol*
22:27  dassouki: funny, transcad is not a cad software at all
22:27  torchie: yeah I just looked it up lol
22:28  dassouki: anyways, I'm happy with office as you're happy with pages. however, it's always the little things in either system
22:28  torchie: i'd love pages if it just had straight up .docx saving/opening
22:29  torchie: opens faster, runs nicer, has a simpler ui but then when you try to just save something in doc/docx... streams of tears
22:30  dassouki: ya well for us pages, doesn't work, table tools, equation tools, integrating documents 
22:31  chris_99: hi, does OSX have a feature like Remote desktop
22:31  dassouki: yes
22:31  chris_99: so i can remotely connect to it
22:31  chris_99: how do i enable that dassouki 
22:32  chris_99: oh, i'm just looking at the sharing window
22:32  chris_99: theres 'screen sharing' which seems to be a VNC based system
22:32  chris_99: is there another way too?
22:32  ubijtsa: chris_99: yeah, it's VNC iirc..
22:33  chris_99: ah :(
22:33  chris_99: i was hoping for a server approach, like X11 in linux
22:33  ubijtsa: chris_99: at least, I've connected to OS-X from Linux using a vnc viewer..
22:33  ubijtsa: chris_99: there is something server like, but that's $$$
