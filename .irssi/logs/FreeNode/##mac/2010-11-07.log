21:03  Branes: Mornin'
21:03  Swian: afternoon here
21:03  torchie: hey hey
21:03  Swian: but greetings
21:06  crilly: Anyone here use Dropbox? Quick question: when I'm moving a file, or set of files around my DB folders, I'm not getting the blue "sync" icon on them. I'm moving the files from one DB folder to another - have they updated the client/service to now minimise duplicate files?
21:07  Swian: I do
21:07  Swian: never experienced that
21:08  Branes: If I've ever moved stuff on a dropbox, it's always been counted as a delete and re-upload
21:08  crilly: Yeah it hasn't done that for me in this instance, and I've moved nearly 8MB of files and it didn't re-upload then, yet, they have perfectly valid and working public links? Interesting.

21:15  lindsaymobil22: Hey guys
21:16  lindsaymobil22: I heard someone here deleted his terminal.app?
21:16  lindsaymobil22: his/her*
21:19  crilly: lindsaymobil22: ?
21:19  lindsaymobil22: crilly, i heard someone here had deleted their terminal.app, nevermind
21:19  Branes: That'd most likely be me. And the shells.
21:19  crilly: lol yeah
21:20  lindsaymobil22: i just have to ask Branes , why?
21:20  heycam: hi! i have a macbook pro 6,2 and i'm going to upgrade its ram from 4GB to 8GB. it currently has 1067 MHz sodimms. does the motherboard support higher speed memory?
21:20  Branes: lindsaymobil22: because after a decade at the prompt, I swore off using neolithic interfaces back in 1984.
21:21  crilly: Oh ou had to ask, lindsaymobil22 
21:21  Branes: heycam: Maybe, and even if it did, the memory won't run any faster anyway.
21:21  Branes: heycam: No guarantee; you'd best play safe and stick with the rated speed.
21:22  heycam: Branes, ok. yeah my question is if i get the higher speed, will i get any advantage out of it, or will it just run at 1067 MHz.
21:22  Branes: No advantage.
21:22  heycam: Branes, ok thanks.

23:29  Kasm279: jeremyw: im tryikng out Opera 11 Alpha :D
23:29  Tomis: silly masocist
23:29  Tomis: thinking opera will ever be usable
23:29  Kasm279: hey i like it :D
23:30  Tomis: i keep trying it, hoping they'll get it together at some point
23:31 * Branes finds Opera to be eminently more usable, smoother and more stable than Snuffari or Firepig
23:32  Tomis: wow
23:33  Tomis: in terms of usablity and good use of resources i'd probably go Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera
23:34 * Branes observes that his Opera is currently using a modest 181 MB of memory
23:34  Tomis: i'm more concerned with efficient use of my CPU/GPU
23:36  Kasm279: Tomis: i would rather use Opera than firefox
23:36  Kasm279: my list is Opera, Chrome, Safari, Lunascape, Flock, Firefox, IE
23:37  Tomis: the only thing lower than opera for me would be.. i dunno.. some dead browser like iCab or something
23:37  Kasm279: have you ever heard of lunascape?
23:38  Tomis: googlin
23:38  Kasm279: Tomis
23:38  ChrisAM: Don't forget about OmniWeb
23:39  Kasm279: i think if i ever get an iPad i will install lunascape
23:39  Kasm279: does safari for iOS have tabs?
23:39  Tomis: it does Kasm279 
23:39  Tomis: not like safari on the desktop does though
23:40  Kasm279: Tomis: lunadcape is pretty neat
23:40  Kasm279: its very heavy on CPU and RAM though
23:40  Tomis: well it's running three engines at once
23:40  Tomis: no woner
23:40  Kasm279: even in single engine mode
23:43  Kasm279: whoo
23:43  Kasm279: i like the new lists in mail
23:43  Kasm279: instead of having an arrow like you usually have
23:43  Kasm279: its a bar you clock and the sub items slide out from it
23:43  Kasm279: click again and they dissapear
23:45  Kasm279: can't wait for addons though :D
