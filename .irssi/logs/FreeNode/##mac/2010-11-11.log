01:22  Al2O3: or, what is a sweet epub viewer for osx that is free?

01:24  Al2O3: I'm going to give Calibre and Stanza each a shot.
01:24  Al2O3: I'll try DE also.
01:24  Al2O3: Thanks.

01:27  Al2O3: downloading the fbreader also, thank you.
02:11  nomad411: Ok, this cannot be the norm. Any Vimeo video playing in Safari just kills my machine!  It just hangs and hangs and I cannot do anything but hope that it finally releases its death grip. Is that the way it is with you guys?
02:11  nomad411: Flash videos, not just Vimeo

03:10  guerrilha_radio: hello! well, i need to help a friend to do something for me on a mac, but i dont know if its possible with the software he gets there. Its like that, he made a movie for me, but i need him to upload for me the finished .iso image, not the .mov file. He got the roxio tosat program
03:10  guerrilha_radio: is there an output in that app that he can burn a project to an image, instead to a burned dvd itself?

03:32  essial: Hey guys, any particular reason string.h seems to be missing strlen()?
03:33  essial: I mean it's an ANSI standard to include strlen in string.h, so i'm hoping for mac's sake I'm just doing it wrong
03:36  Kasm279: essial: check #macdev
03:36  essial: It's OK i discovered siwtching back to the ancient version of gcc included with mac works
03:37  essial: it's like libc doesn't get linked properly, go figure
03:37  essial: that's ok because libSystem has a friggen memory leak in it :)
03:42  someprimetime: i just was trying to partition off part of my hdd to install windows, and my macbook crashed.. so i had to restart mid-way through. has this screwed anything up?
03:46  essial: someprimetime: You didn't reformat any partitions did you?
03:46  essial: If not just re-install on the same windows partition, you can even do a quick ntfs format over it
03:47  essial: as long as you don't tell windows to use your OSX partition you're a-ok
03:47  someprimetime: ah ok, i should have been more clear. this was while i was in bootcamp assistant
03:47  someprimetime: it was half-way through and just crashed and i had to hard-restart
03:47  essial: ah that's concerning, open up diskutil
03:48  essial: tell me what you see for your main HDD
03:48  essial: the sub-items if you will
03:49  essial: all bootcamp does is split your partitions, and update the boot loader to show you a choice between OSX and the new partition
03:50  someprimetime: ok this is super weird... h/o one sec
03:50  essial: so if it only shows one partition, it didn't do anything, if it shows two, its entirely possible it simply screwed up trying to format the NTFS drive, which I re-do with the windows install anyway
03:50  essial: I'm starting to discover that this is the norm for macs :p
03:50  essial: i'd def. verify your Macintosh HD partition though
03:51  someprimetime: http://imgur.com/YOO4v.png that is inside diskutil
03:51  someprimetime: http://imgur.com/fL5LV.png that is the status window for my istatsmenu
03:51  someprimetime: http://imgur.com/tkI3H.png that is inside my home directory folder
03:51  someprimetime: they all show different sizes available for hdd space
03:52  essial: yeah go to diskutil
03:53  essial: click on "Soft Drive"
03:53  essial: click "verify disk"
03:53  essial: sounds like some things got broken a bit
03:53  someprimetime: ok thanks essial :D
03:53  someprimetime: verifying now
03:54  essial: if verify fails then what i'd recommend doing is booting into your OSX installation disk, and when it comes up, run disk utility form there, and run repair disk on that same partition
03:54  essial: I woudln't run repair disk from the live os
03:54  essial: just me being paranoid :)
03:55  essial: BTW a little tidbit I found out the hard way.. if a disk gets stuck in your drive, you have to hold down eject BEFORE you press the power button, and keep it down until it comes out >.<
03:55  essial: which is not what my manual says
03:56  Kasm279: you can also hold the mouse button :P
03:56  essial: that didn't work
03:57  essial: This is my first mac, and I was already very weary of the slot-loader, getting a disk stuck in there in the first week didn't help things
03:58  essial: Of course I did get to freak out my wife by taking a perfectively correct picture of the inside of the imac, and making it my wallpaper so everything lined up perfectly
03:58  essial: it was pretty epic
03:58  essial: "OMG why'd you take you mac apart"

04:07  essial: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4250
04:09  fleebailey33: combo update link?
04:09  essial: I just pulled from the system updates menu item
04:09  essial: Apple->Software Update
04:09  fleebailey33: meh
04:09  fleebailey33: combo = less problems
04:09  MultiFinder: fleebailey33: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1324
04:10  essial: What.. that not easy enough? :p
04:10  fleebailey33: MultiFinder:  ooof
04:10  fleebailey33: oooh
04:10  MultiFinder: essial: Some of us have multiple Macs to update and don't want to download it a kazillion times.
04:10  essial: ah ok :)
04:10  essial: This is my first one ever so :p
04:10  MultiFinder: Fair enough :)
04:11  essial: I've fixed plenty in my shop with bad motherboards, but never actually owned one until now :)
04:11  essial: Still getting used to the fact I can't customize the UI at all :-/
04:11  fleebailey33: its a logic board
04:11  fleebailey33: :P
04:11  essial: no it's a motherboard :)
04:11  essial: looks like one, fixes like one
04:11  fleebailey33: mainboard
04:11  MultiFinder: essial: Welcome to the Mac Universe - it's a Logic Board :P
04:11  essial: one had a row of 6 bad capacitors, someone gave the guy it for free, mac store told them the whole board had to be replaced
04:11  fleebailey33: :)
04:12  essial: estimated like $580
04:12  essial: I told them $120 flat fee for solder jobs, and it worked perfectly, the guy who gave them the mac was pissed I was able to fix it :)
04:13  fleebailey33: you cant blame apple
04:13  fleebailey33: and they usually give really high estimates, prices
04:13  essial: Nope, I fix bad caps on everything from TVs to computers
04:13  fleebailey33: but lots of times they care of you for free
04:14  beterraba: i want to play a .avi video with a .srt subtitle. what softwer should i use?
04:14  essial: the only thing i really hate is that you can't just order a part from apple
04:14  essial: extremely frustrating when the fix is simple but the part is literally impossible to get
04:14  MultiFinder: beterraba: Try VLC. It plays every oddball format that anybody anywhere has ever come up with.
04:14  essial: If I ever run into that problem with this iMac i'll never buy another one, so I'm hoping it doesn't happen :)
04:15  essial: before I ever turned it on I opened it up and checked it out ^_^
04:15  beterraba: is there anybody from brazil here?
04:15  beterraba: i`d like to access banco do brasil
04:17  essial: BTW do you guys use the dock in the bottom or side of the screen, just curious
04:20  netdaemon: left or bottom, depending on mood
04:21  netdaemon: had it on the left for a few weeks
04:21  netdaemon: then i needed horizontal space so i moved it back...probably repeat the process reverse in the future
04:21  essial: rebooting to install the update :)
04:21  essial: I keep mine on the left as it makes more sense with a wide screen
04:25  wuntee: does anyone know if you can boot from a USB drive? i have a linux install on a usb drive i am trying to get to, but when pressing the option button on boot does not show it in the list....
04:33  Branes: wuntee: It won't do it. 1) Macs can only boot from an external device if it uses GPT (not MBR), 2) if you want to run a linux, keep it inside a virtual machine with OSX (or Windows with Boot Camp) as the host OS.

04:56  MariusAZ: I don't think that works on 10.6

05:05  MultiFinder: Here's an interesting conundrum - I'm trying to merge some free space on an external disk into an existing partition. I'm trying to put it in the partition "Mac mini" and there does not seem to be any way to tell Disk Utility to merge them. Anybody have any ideas? Screenie of the situation - http://i56.tinypic.com/5fkbaa.png
05:12 * derp is a new mac user
05:14  Branes: MultiFinder: Disk Utility isn't clever enough to merge.
05:15  MultiFinder: Branes: Any suggestions on something that isn't terribly expensive that is clever enough?
05:18  Branes: Coriolis iPartition (commercial) is the only app which I believe can merge HFS
05:27  Mage_Dude: Speakable items is weird... 
05:46  dkam: Anyone know if the Belkin USB to Serial adaptors are supported under 10.6?  In linux, they show up as /dev/ttyUSB and I use screen to attach. Anyone know how to use one with a Mac?
05:51  Branes: Choose one which the manufacturer says supports OSX and comes with drivers
06:44  aquestion: What do you guys think about the older imac speakers?
06:47  beterraba: what do i need to run java applets on mac?

06:53  CPng|N: open Terminal, enter "java"
06:53  beterraba: ok
06:53  beterraba: i saw it
06:53  beterraba: but
06:53  beterraba: this webpage: http://thierry.masson.free.fr/IA/en/qlearning_applet.htm should show some applet
06:54  beterraba: which has been written in java
06:54  aquestion: beterraba: It doesn't work for me and I KNOW I have Java installed
06:54  beterraba: doesn't it bother you?
06:54  aquestion: beterraba: Wait, nevermind. It does. 
06:55  aquestion: I see Map Size, etc
06:55  beterraba: ..
06:55  beterraba: :P
06:55  beterraba: it doesn't for me
06:55  CPng|N: maybe you aren't waiting long enough
06:55  aquestion: beterraba: What browser?
06:55  CPng|N: or you have it disabled in the browser
06:55  aquestion: Yeah. java is slooow. 
06:56  beterraba: i'm using firefox
06:56  aquestion: And that too. There are preferences in every browser to disable java
06:56  beterraba: let me see it
06:56  aquestion: beterraba: Go to Tools > Add Ons > Plugins
07:00  beterraba: aquestion: ok. i see it. what pluggin do you suggest so i can use this applet?
07:00  aquestion: You should see Java Embedding Plugin and Java Plug-In 
07:01  aquestion: And they should both be enabled

11:14  eagles0513875|2: ?
11:14  eagles0513875|2: is it even out 
11:14  eagles0513875|2: i checked for updates yesterday and no updates were available
11:20  ayaz: eagles0513875|2: I believe it is out. The combo update, for example, is available for download over here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1324
11:20  eagles0513875|2: will have to get my hands on it this afternoon
11:40  Isenn: Anyone know how you edit the names in Entourage autocomplete list?
11:53  Angostura: ayaz: "rolled over" means what, in this context?
11:54  Angostura: I've installed it, if that's what you mean
12:01  ayaz: Angostura: Yes, that's what I meant to say. Have you noticed any issues after installing it?
12:02  InsolentDreams: Anyone seen the actual changelog for the update yet?  I saw the rss feeds about the update, but didn't see an article with someone dissecting it yet
12:02  InsolentDreams: I like seeing it dissected, to see how much it'll affect me  ;)
12:03  Angostura: ayaz: Nope. TF2 plays a lttle faster perhaps
12:11  b3ny0-: L4D2 performed quite poor compared to win version
12:12  Angostura: in terms of performance?
12:12  b3ny0-: yes
12:13  b3ny0-: dunno about TF2, played it for years on the pc and it has always handled well there
12:44  yt_ror: how do I navigate Terminal Tabs from keyboard 
12:46  ayaz: yt_ror: If you look under the Window menu for the Terminal.app, you will find the different keyboard shorcuts for cycling through tabs.
12:59  yt_ror: ayaz: new to mac ehere is Terminal.app located ?
13:00  ayaz: yt_ror: By Terminal.app, I mean Terminal. 
13:01  Angostura: ayaz: It sits in Applications/Utilities
13:02  Angostura: You can use Spotlight to locate stuff like that
13:02  Angostura: (or indeed most other things)
13:06  yt_ror: I have the terminal open
13:06  yt_ror: and I have 4 tabs open 
13:06  yt_ror: and I wont to switch tab without using the ouse
13:07  yt_ror: which keyboard key should I use ?
13:16  Angostura: hang on
13:18  Angostura: yt_ror: Cick Window in the menu bar,  the shortcuts are displayed to the right of the command, 
13:19  Angostura: eg command-} Next Tab
13:26  richardcavell: Who's downloaded 10.6.5?
13:26  richardcavell: Looks like a decent list of fixes
13:27  yt_ror: Angostura: what do you mean by click Windows ?
13:27  Angostura: richardcavell: Installed last night, seems fine
13:28  Angostura: yt_ror: Are you familiar with the term "Menubar"?
13:33  Branes: yt_ror: On MacOS, the keyboard as a mechanism of control is considered to be deprecated, in many cases using the mouse is the only way to perform certain actions.
13:39  Angostura: Branes: ... but not in this case
13:40  Angostura: However I'm a bit concerned about letting a person loose with Terminal who can't find the menu bar:-)
13:40  Angostura: Seen this, by the way? http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2010/11/11/amd-fusion-deal-with-apple/
13:41  Angostura: What do you think? Real, or someone has their lines crossed?
13:44  Branes: Apple have been after the underlying APU/GPU technology of what's now AMD Fusion for some time; they're not after Fusion itself.
13:46  Branes: AMD lost three of their top GPU minds to Mike Papermaster about 18 months ago; shortly after, the rumour-mill was reporting that Apple and AMD were in talks, about what, nobody could say.
13:46  Angostura: Interesting - so perhaps an intellectual property licensing deal rather than a processor sales deal
13:49  Branes: Despite having publicly taken the fall for the iPhone 4 antenna debacle and officially stepped down from the top chair at Hardware Engineering, he is still very very much in control. He's the real gem in Steve's grand plan, and one of Steve's first money-no-object purchases.
13:51  Branes: Steve has implicit trust in Papermaster, and so far, whatever Mike has asked for, Steve's signed the cheque without hesitation. New equipment, new staff, new companies, new IP ...
13:56  Angostura: Branes: So this is bunkum? http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704268004575417572159585144.html
13:56  Angostura: "...Mr. Papermaster had lost the confidence of Mr. Jobs months ago and hasn't been part of the decision-making process for some time, these people said. They added that Mr. Papermaster didn't appear to have the type of creative thinking expected at Apple and wasn't used to Apple's corporate culture..."
14:03  Branes: Yeah, pretty much just hot air.
14:04  Angostura: Uhh huh. OK
14:05  Angostura: So he's still working there day-to-day, in charge of things?
14:08  Branes: So I'm lead to believe

15:48  shuaib: Everytime I download a tar.gz archive, my browser warns to that I've used a .gz extention and that would I like to choose .gz.gz instead, and no matter what I select, it saves the file as a .gz.gz. Any ideas? 
15:48  InsolentDreams: milligan_: quit and restart mail client (if there is a unsigned ssl cert, upon first sending you have to accept, if you deny it won't ask again until you restart os-x mail)
15:49  InsolentDreams: milligan_: And it could be l/p issues with the smtp server, not authenticating properly
15:49  InsolentDreams: most smtp servers do not allow unauthenticated email
15:49  InsolentDreams: Or the wrong type of password encoding
15:49  milligan_: I tried shutting down the mail app, and doing a kill -9 on the process .. No change.
15:50  InsolentDreams: Uhh...

15:51  shuaib: Hmmm, I think it's browser's fault, tried in safari and no such problem. Must be something up with Chrome
15:52  InsolentDreams: shuaib: Ahh yeah, Chrome does some weird stuff on the mac sometimes, some really... weird non-mac behaviour
15:52  milligan_: InsolentDreams, Im desperate :) Hell, this stuff should just work .. pain in the arse.
15:53  InsolentDreams: milligan_: Well, if he had it working before, he could have changed something.  Or if he never had it working, well.... you're supposed to be the techie to fix it.  :)  Google is your friend
15:54  ayaz: shuaib: You will only likely find this behaviour with Chrome on MacOS. Regardless of whether it lets you save as .tar.gz or .gz.gz, you will still be able to run the tar command as you would on a proper .tar.gz file.
15:58  Angostura: milligan_: Remote support = you have remote  access to the GUI?
15:58  milligan_: yes
15:58  Angostura: If so, and the remote user is running Mail.app what does Connection Doctor say?
15:59  Angostura: Mail > Window > Connection Doctor
15:59  Angostura: (Show Details)
16:00  Angostura: milligan_:  anyone there?
16:01  milligan_: sec - let me check
16:01  shuaib: ayaz, I recon that, but the behavior is still annoying
16:03  ayaz: shuaib: I know, I wholeheartedly agree with that.
16:05  milligan_: Angostura, no Window under Mail.
16:08  Angostura: milligan_: No Window menu item?
16:08  Angostura: \
16:08  Angostura: I think you'll find there is
16:08  milligan_: found it
16:08  milligan_: connect to internet = ok
16:08  milligan_: connect to one smtp = ok
16:08  milligan_: two other servers no go.
16:11  Angostura: The Show Details button on the Connection Doctor should show the exact errors that the SMTP servers are throwing

17:30 @bashusr: if they had eSATA

17:30  webPragmatist: yea pretty much
17:36  TheoMurpse: I've set up a VPN server on my LAN and the VPN connection on my Mac in Network preferences. Right now, while on the LAN itself, when I connect to the server via its LAN IP, everything is peachy keen. However, when I try to connect to the server via the network's WAN IP, I get connection refused. I have forwarded the PPTP port on my router, and I have enabled PPTP passthrough in its config. It's still not working. Any ideas? I've enabled v

17:51  spasticteapot: Does anyone here run Steam?
17:51  spasticteapot: I think I'm having overheating problems.
17:55  glitchit: is there a mac os x server / xserve channel around?
17:59  TheoMurpse: spasticteapot: Typically, if you steam a laptop, it will increase the internal temperature (and probably cause some damage!)
17:59  spasticteapot: Ha. Ha.
17:59  spasticteapot: I refer to the gaming software, not boiling water.
