09:06  iaj: lo there does somebody know of a neat way to edit Mail.app messages in vim?
09:08  Branes: 'neat' and 'vim' are mutually exclusive ... and people anal enough to call a program "name dot app" needs to have their Mac surgically excised and banished back to the hell that is linux :)
09:09  simplicity-: Lol
09:10  cryptics_: iaj: problem is html and then text. i'm guessing you are editing html
09:11  cryptics_: for people that aren't so caught up on what should be and shouldn't be unlike Branes here :) vim handles text just like any other program
09:12  cryptics_: guess edit is subjective too

09:36  iaj: did you guys have any advices?
09:36  pgpkeys: ahh yeah os x tiger email extension
09:38  iaj: huh?
09:38 --- temhawk|afk is now known as temhawk
09:39  pgpkeys: oh cryptics_ mentioned a file name extension i ID'd it as mail but couldn't figure what program.
09:40  cryptics_: i didn't know what the extension was until 5 mins ago :)
09:40  pgpkeys: ahh i used fileinfo.com
09:41  cryptics_: cd ~/Library/Mail/account/IN... && ls -al didn't work? :P
09:41  fruchthoernschen: Hey Ho, Is there an Graphical System Analysing Tool? like top in console or "htop, if this someone knows from linux".? 
09:41  temhawk: why did iTunes totally mess up my springboard just now? I had a couple of pages and some folders, all nicely organized. now all my apps are spread across countless pages, but now I have compass, voice memo, clock and calculator in a "Utilities" folder —__—
09:41  pgpkeys: Applications, Utilities, Activity Monitor
09:42  q_a_z_steve: holy @#$* the TextEdit just brought up a doc I never saved and thought I lost to a kernel panic. How the crap did that happen?
09:42  pgpkeys: fruchthoernschen: for you
09:42  fruchthoernschen: hehe ;) 
09:42  fruchthoernschen: ah, now *g*
09:42  pgpkeys: q_a_z_steve: think it defaults to saving a temp copy 
09:43  fruchthoernschen: pgpkeys: I think this tool I have searched, sawn it in different post/topic in my google search. 
09:43  fruchthoernschen: < checks again
09:43  temhawk: fruchthoernschen: CheckUp
09:43  q_a_z_steve: I'll be, I never thought a text editor like 'at would treat me like 'at. Much obliged Mr. Jobs.
09:43  pgpkeys: heh
09:43  temhawk: XD
09:44  fruchthoernschen: hmm I can't find it?
09:44  fruchthoernschen: hmm 
09:44  cryptics_: fruchthoernschen: in Applictions/Utilities/Acitivity Monitor
09:44  fruchthoernschen: with my loved terminal I find it. 
09:45  fruchthoernschen: yeah /Applications/Utilities/Activity\ Monitor.app/
09:45  cryptics_: try sorting by name or something
09:45  fruchthoernschen: hgrml
09:46  fruchthoernschen: fuck up… the language overlay for directorys! 
09:46  fruchthoernschen: thanks now I have it
09:46  fruchthoernschen: on german, called "Dienstprogramme" 
09:47  iaj: Get Quicksilver, and let it do the hard work.
09:48  pgpkeys: hehe man, you guys give me way too many things to google
09:48 * pgpkeys heads over to find quicksilver
09:50  cryptics_: iaj: doubt it would help with german naming :) 
09:50  temhawk: pgpkeys: really? what have you been googling so far?
09:51  fruchthoernschen: iaj:  that was the Idea which I have had already ;) but Quicksilver doesn't know the Application under the correct default name  "Activity Monitor", it knows only the overlay names. Overlaying for directory names is one thing which I don't like.
09:51  pgpkeys: crap tons of stuff you guys mention in here
09:51  pgpkeys: checkup and quicksilver being the latest 2
09:51  temhawk: ok :)
09:51  pgpkeys: i've only been using a mac for less than 2 months. so all these toolsets are news to me
09:51  pgpkeys: some are useless to me, but quite a few come in handy
09:54  temhawk: fruchthoernschen: maybe, if you want to try it, delete the .localized file in /Applications (and/or other places)
09:56  temhawk: that should work, but if you want to disable the localization, better rename the file instead of deleting it so you can revert back to it in case you change your mind
10:00  fruchthoernschen: temhawk:  great! ;)

10:33 +crilly|w: ShadeS, you're in Cheshire, England?
10:49  iaj: YAYAAAA i found an app that lets me edit Mail.app messages in MacVim *happY*
10:50  ayaz: iaj: Which app is that?
10:52  iaj: QuickCursor :)
10:54  ayaz: iaj: Thanks. MacVim has an integration feature that lets other applications use MacVim as an editor. It used to work for me with Mail.app but in recent versions of Mail.app, it stopped working, and I can't find the setting in Mail.app to select it.
10:55  iaj: ayaz: Yup.. its gone.. And I hated not to have autocompletion in Mail.app... ;-)
10:55  shuaib: I am facing numerous issues mail.app. Lets put aside the occasional crashing for now, my primary concern is that it syncs very late. I get my emails hours after I have recieved them at the server side. Any ideas guys? Read on web to disable "IDLE" support, just did that but not sure if that will solve anything
10:56  cryptics_: hours after?
10:56  shuaib: cryptics_: yep
10:56  cryptics_: what is your check new messages set to?
10:57  shuaib: every 5 mins
10:58  cryptics_: hrm something is very wrong then... tried creating a new system account and setting up mail and testing that?
10:58  shuaib: new system account?
10:58  shuaib: user account?
10:58  cryptics_: yeah
10:59  cryptics_: accounts in mail and os x didn't know how to reference it :)
10:59  ayaz: shuaib: Yea, something seems really wrong there. I've Mail.app configured with four Gmail IMAP accounts, and I've not once faced any latency/sloweness issues that you describe.
11:00  shuaib: well it has started to happen only recently
11:00  shuaib: Hmm, may be I should run those maintenance scripts
11:01  ayaz: shuaib: Also, have you looked at the Activity window for Mail.app to see what's going on under the hood?
11:01  shuaib: activity window?
11:02  shuaib: aah found it
11:02  shuaib: I'll keep an eye on it
11:02  ayaz: shuaib: Yeah, CMD + 0 if you're in mail.app
11:09  shuaib: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1895
11:09  shuaib: I indeed have GBs of mail. May be time to clean that out. And unsubscribe from lists I seldom follow
11:25  pgpkeys: still not cool that it does that
11:25  pgpkeys: glad i'm not usingit with one of my gmail accounts. would definitely kill it
11:29  temhawk: i just discovered probably the most useless thing of the year in Mac OS X...
11:30  shuaib: temhawk: and that is...?
11:30  EdLin: joekv, hi
11:30  temhawk: i selected all my apps, hit spacebar for quick look, go to the "Index sheet", and then i hold shift while clicking one of the apps... XD
11:31  shuaib: temhawk: and what did that do?
11:32  temhawk: it looks kinda cool how all the other apps blur together and make a "glowy" effect around the app that i clicked on xD
11:32  temhawk: shuaib: what i just said, but in slow-mo
11:32  shuaib: I see
11:36  temhawk: you must be thinking that i'm really bored or weird that i would quick look all my apps in the first place... XD
11:39  shuaib: temhawk: I just tried. It did't do what you said
11:39  temhawk: shuaib: snow leppy?
11:39  shuaib: temhawk: yea
11:39  temhawk: what didn't work? o.O
11:45  temhawk: goodness, i love tineye.com
11:47  temhawk: makes it so easy to snatch cool wallpapers from screencasts and stuff XD

12:36  Lashknife: hello all, got a little problem with a mbp
12:36  Lashknife: it runs and boots fine in a current install
12:36  Lashknife: but refuses to reboot into cd
12:36  Lashknife: so i could factory reinstall osx
12:36  Lashknife: upon doing cmd-v it hangs on something called mkext with 2 lines of dots
12:37  Lashknife: if i dont use that verbal mode, it's just an apple screen loading nothing for a day and longer
12:37  Lashknife: any clue what i need to do to format this mac?
12:37  Lashknife: its an official store snowleopard disk
12:38  AnthonyCat: Lashknife: You are holding option right?
12:38  Lashknife: holding option does what?
12:38  AnthonyCat: Lashknife: Allows you to pick which device to boot from
12:38  Lashknife: i did that, selected cd
12:38  Lashknife: then it hangs
12:39  Lashknife: normal hdd boot, boots nice into current osx install
12:42  AnthonyCat: Lashknife Maybe try putting the non-snow leopard disk in, and see what happens?
12:42  AnthonyCat: I have no idea though.
12:43  AnthonyCat: Lashknife: or try removing any external devices?
12:43  Lashknife: nothing hooked to the mbp
12:44  Lashknife: can i go into cmd-v mode after doing the option-boot-menu choice?
12:44  Lashknife: or only one at a time
12:45  AnthonyCat: Lashknife: I can try it on mine
12:45  AnthonyCat: if that would help?
12:46  Fedayk1n: I'd make a dmg of the dvd,  restore that dmg to a usb drive, and try booting from it
12:47 --- crilly is now known as crilly|w
12:48  Lashknife: hmm apparently there's no way to tell it "boot from cd in verbose mode"
12:50 +LaraX: hi Fedayk1n
12:50  Lashknife: so what i'm doing now is, bootinto the existing osx
12:50  Lashknife: then insert the osx dvd
12:50  Lashknife: and go in that setup, choose utilities, which tells me a nice "restart" button
12:51  Lashknife: then a black screen flashes, i can press verbose mode after this and then i get that hang
12:51 +crilly|w: You can use 'Startup Disc' in the system preferences
12:52  Lashknife: ah pro-tip
12:52  Lashknife: let's see
12:52  Lashknife: can it boot dvd's on battery?
12:52  Lashknife: i assume so
12:52 +crilly|w: It should do, aye
12:53  Lashknife: efiboot blablabla
12:54  Lashknife: loading system\library\caches\com.apple.kext.caches\startup\extensions.mkext
12:54  Lashknife: then .............................................................<nothing>
12:54  AnthonyCat: Lashknife: Maybe try D for a hardware test?
12:54  Lashknife: is there a ctrl-alt-del reboot command?
12:54  Lashknife: or power down/up
12:56  iaj: when Im on a finder window and want to go to the very top of the current window's item, is there a hotkey for that?
12:56  Lashknife: ok
12:57  Lashknife: found a reasonable comment somewhere
12:57  Lashknife: apple says: do not use discs older than your device
12:57  Lashknife: so i'm screwed and need a 10.6.2 and my bought disk is prolly just a 10.6
12:57  Lashknife: meh
12:57  temhawk: iaj: page top button?
12:58  temhawk: (the angled arrows next to fn and forward del)
13:00  Lashknife: meh, so now you know
13:00  Lashknife: too old dvd version
13:00  Lashknife: pfrt
13:00  Lashknife: so much for buying it then
13:01  Lashknife: thanks for help tho
13:02  Lashknife: learned a few things
13:02  Fedayk1n: 'allo lara
13:02  iaj: temhawk: hmm, im on a macbook pro :\ none such keys
13:02  Fedayk1n: Lashknife: take it back in to an apple store,  and they should swap ua up to a current disk
13:02  iaj: temhawk: i can do fn + up but that only scrolls... doesn't select the top element :(
13:03  temhawk: oh
13:03  temhawk: iaj: just hit "1" or "A" ;)
13:03  Lashknife: oh?
13:03  Lashknife: they do that for free?
13:04  Lashknife: i bought this a long time ago (it department)
13:04  Lashknife: just got a mbp that i need to cleanse
13:04  Lashknife: for sale
13:04  Lashknife: so just thought to do a clean install but i lack the disk
13:04  Lashknife: got people looking upstairs for the proper disk that came with the book now
13:04  iaj: temhawk: not a good solution :\\\ 
13:04  iaj: :)
13:04  Lashknife: if they have it, else we'll go out and get a new edition
13:05  Lashknife: but we don't support mac really here so i was rather confused about this versioning stuff apple uses
13:05  temhawk: iaj: why not? you got something above that alphanumeric order?
13:05  Lashknife: pretty restrictive
13:05  iaj: temhawk: well...what if the first item is a b :D
13:05  iaj: temhawk: my folder is sorted by modification date.
13:06  temhawk: iaj: even if it's "b", it will go to that (it simply picks the next-best if something with "a" doesn't exist). but if it's not alphanumerically ordered, it's useless of course..
13:08  iaj: temhawk: :-[   theres not such a thing build-in.. wow
13:08  iaj: only possible way is... ESC, FN+up, down
13:09  temhawk: iaj: i think escape + tab does it :)
13:09  temhawk: (not at the same time, after each other)
13:10  temhawk: nevermind__
13:10  iaj: :D
13:10  iaj: same item :(
13:11  AnthonyCat: iaj: esc, then down
13:11  temhawk: pff

17:28  fujisan: VirusBarrier Tomis ?
17:28  Tomis: lol you boot into a sepperate OS to do your banking?
17:28  Tomis: why?
17:28  Angostura: Mainly because unlike most crapware antivirus software it seems harmless - takes minimal system resources, is nicely written and it may one day stop something
17:28  fujisan: paranoia
17:28  fujisan: it's safer Tomis

17:29  iaj: how can I find out the hexcode of a keypress?
17:29  Tomis: so instead of running an up-to-date browser with the latest security fixes, you run a static OS from a CD
17:29  Thujone: which keypress
17:29  fujisan: Angostura:  if you have a keylogger using a VM won't help
17:29  fujisan: so therefore using the livecd method is safer
17:29  iaj: Thujone: well I want to know what hexcode is the keypress of CONTROL-F for example?
17:30  Tomis: control-F isn't a character afaik
17:30  Angostura: fujisan: I' not advocating a VM, that was Thujone 
17:30  Tomis: it's control and the f key
17:30  Tomis: option-f produces a specific character
17:30  fujisan: Tomis:  i download a new distro of Ubuntu all the time
17:30  iaj: Tomis: trying to set up iTerm to be able to scroll up and down
17:31  fujisan: and Tomis  before i do the online banking i update the browser
17:31  fujisan: you can do that with a livecd
17:31  fujisan: its not that static Tomis 
17:31  Tomis: so you're constantly downloading and burning CDs fujisan ?
17:31  fujisan: every 6 months
17:31  fujisan: hardly constantly
17:32  Tomis: so you're always 6 months behind on the latest security fixes
17:32  fujisan: and its rewritable cd-rom

17:33  simplicity-: luist, Counter Strike Source is available trough steam
17:33  fujisan: luist: ye i had the windows version of halflife2 and could play steam on os x without issues w/o having to repay valve :)
17:33  fujisan: i mean counterstrike*
17:33  luist: is it any different from using cider port?
17:33  fujisan: no clue on that
17:33  Fenhl: I have a problem with os x server
17:34  Angostura: luist: I think they've recoded, rather than ciderized
17:34  Fenhl: lan works, wan works, dhcp and nat have a green light in server admin
17:34  fujisan: Valve is really a great gaming company
17:34  Fenhl: but I can't connect to the internet with a client
17:35  Fenhl: why might that be?
17:35  luist: steam is the mac CS? where should i download it?
17:35  Angostura: http://www.valvesoftware.com/
17:36  Fenhl: luist: no, steam is a game platform/store/social network thing
17:36  Angostura: Fenhl: When you say "LAN works, WAN works" what do you mean?
17:36  fujisan: i haven't booted steam in over 6 weeks
17:37  Angostura: Think of all the hats you've missed
17:37  Fenhl: LAN works means the client can display the example webpage hosted on the server
17:37  Fenhl: through http://192.168.1.1/index.htm
17:37  Angostura: WAN works?
17:37  Fenhl: WAN works: I'm typing this on the server
17:38  Angostura: OK, so you can connect to the Internet
17:38 * Fenhl nods
17:38  Angostura: so its Web clients that are the problem?
17:38  Angostura: Dodgy proxy settings?
17:39  Fenhl: I don't know of any proxy settings
17:39  Fenhl: where can I see that?
17:39  Angostura: What error do you get on trying to browse an external site?
17:39  Angostura: (exact wording)
17:41  CEnTR4L: Women and hearts.
17:41  Fenhl: Safari can’t open the page “http://example.org/” because the server where this page is located isn’t responding.
17:43  simplicity-: meh Call Of Duty isn't available in the Danish MAS :(
17:43  Fenhl: brb, testing on another client
17:46  Angostura: Hmmm, so it's not a DNS problem
17:47  iaj: someone using iTerm and got its keyboard profile remap
17:47  Angostura: Other machines on the LAN can get to example.com OK?
17:49  Fenhl: Back from testing with the Windows client, Firefox says "Could not find the server at www.example.org"
17:51  Fenhl: then again, the windows client isn't showing up in the clients list
17:52  Angostura: Try restarting your router
17:52  iaj: Anyone can tell me whether its possible to map CONTROL_B to scrollback on iTerm?
17:53  Fenhl: Angostura: you mean the server? because that's my router
17:58  Fenhl: or do you mean the DSL modem/router which has PPPoE passthrough activated?
17:59  q_a_z_steve: hey, how do I find the codename/family name of my macbook pro? i.e. SantaRosa or whatever?
18:00  simplicity-: Go to the apple in the left upper corner.. "About this mac".. "More".. "Model identifier" im guessing?
18:00  Fenhl: q_a_z_steve: iirc, MacTracker has that feature
18:04  q_a_z_steve: I have to download something? meh, I guess it will have other useful things... :/
18:04  Fenhl: q_a_z_steve: you're talking about the processor's codename, right?
18:06  Fenhl: if that's the case, system profiler sadly doesn't display it
18:06  Fenhl: or the real name, for that matter
18:07  Fenhl: mactracker is at http://www.mactracker.ca/
18:07  q_a_z_steve: "real" name?
18:07  q_a_z_steve: yeah, I downloaded via the googler already thanks
18:09  Fenhl: you know, as in, the model number
18:09  Fenhl: Santa Rosa is a bad example as it doesn't have one
18:09  Fenhl: according to wikipedia
18:10  Fenhl: but modt core 2 duo and core duo processors have those in addition to codenames
18:11  Fenhl: lol
18:11  Fenhl: so, any ideas about my problem?
18:20  Wooga: hello, is there anything like mingw, but for macos; to compile macos binaries on linux machine?

19:12  asfjio: hello guys! does time machine make it's backups encrypted?
19:13  simplicity-: No it doesn't
19:15  asfjio: i ask, beacuse i wan to buy WD extrenal HDD [http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=420], and it's says it support encryption. but probably it is made by their software i'm going probably not to use.
19:15  asfjio: that's bad news for me.
19:16  simplicity-: well, yeah.
19:16  simplicity-: Well i guess there's software that will let you do an encryptet backup, just not TM.
19:19  asfjio: simplicity-: probably, but i think that if the OS propose such a functionality, it's good to use it. and actually it is quiet fancy as far as i saw videos of restoring a file :).
19:20  simplicity-: Yeah it kinda is.
19:20  Angostura: asfjio: I suppose it might be possible that the drive supports encryption so that you pop in a password when it mounts
19:20  simplicity-: I rarely open TM tho, i just browse the HDD in finder when i need something.
19:21  Angostura: But while mounted, the encryption is invisible to the machine's OS
19:21  Angostura: in which case TM would work just fine
19:22  simplicity-: oh yea, didn't think of that. But it removes a bit of the ease with TM.
19:22  asfjio: Angostura: but do you think TM can accept a password for mounting the volume before do a backup?
19:23  Angostura: asfjio: With TM the drive typically just stays mounted all the time - you don't keep mounting and dismnounting
19:24  Angostura: i.e plug in the drive, enter PW, mount  - away you go until you deliberately unmount again
19:24  Angostura: I'm speculating on what this drive does, however
19:24  asfjio: Angostura: yes i understand. so if it is a really a hardware encryption from the HDD (which i doubt) i should just type the password each time i connect the drive.
19:25  Angostura: Well, that's what I'm suggesting might be the case in an ideal world, yes :-)
19:25  simplicity-: Otherwise, you could just use Truecrypt, it's free.
19:25  asfjio: simplicity-: how? in conjuction with TM?
19:25  simplicity-: In the same way, as Angostura just explained.
19:26  Angostura: Yeh, or you could create an encrypted disk image on the volume, I guess
19:26  Angostura: lots of ways to skin this cat
19:27  asfjio: Angostura: yes, that would be beyond an ideal world :), because i'm pretty unsure it does hardware encryption, in order to stuck you with their backup software system.
19:28  Angostura: asfjio: shudder. Avoid that. Where's the mention of crypto on the site?
19:29  asfjio: i did in the past a dmg encrypted file witch could be mounted with the "hardware utils". do we talk the same things? i mean not dmg file but a real partition?
19:31  asfjio: Angostura: the software is "WD SmartWare" [http://www.wdc.com/global/products/video/?language=en&typeid=2&id=682818400001], the second video..
19:32  asfjio: simplicity-: does truecrypt encrypts an existing partiotion or just images?
19:32  simplicity-: Both.
19:33  Angostura: asfjio: Sorry,  I can't watch that, After 30 seconds I want to stamp on that smily lady's foot.
19:33  asfjio: simplicity-: what do you suggest to use truecrypt or the buildin "Disk Utility" ability to encrypt?
19:33  simplicity-: I don't know, i don't use either anymore.
19:33  asfjio: Angostura: anyway, i bet it's not good as TM.
19:34  asfjio: does someone else know?
19:35  asfjio: it says "Disk Utility" can use "256-bit AES" any good reason to use TrueCrypt? i ask, because i just know that TrueCrypt exists, but never used it.
19:36  asfjio: *by "256-bit AES" i mean encryption
19:37  asfjio: simplicity- , Angostura: anyway, i have to go. thank you ALL for your time!
20:17  fruchthoernschen: hola
20:17  fruchthoernschen: is there an way to open Files by the complete path? I can't see an path/filename inputbox in the application like: TextMate
20:22  Angostura: fruchthoernschen: Don't quite understand 
20:23  Angostura: hang on a second while I bring up Textmate
20:24  Angostura: So what are you trying to do?
20:25  fruchthoernschen: hmm I want open an File by an given Path with filename and not with clicking throw the Folders
20:25  fruchthoernschen: ;)
20:30  Angostura: fruchthoernschen: You're out of luck old chum. Of course, you can always speed things up by dragging often used folders into the sidebar
20:31  Angostura: The only place in the whole of Mac OS where you can type paths in the GUI is in Finder's Go > Go to Folder as far as I know
20:31  Angostura: You could use that and then click on the file you find there
20:32  fruchthoernschen: Angostura:  hehe okay ;)

21:35  nubnub: i found this anti-virus program called iAntiVirus, do macs need an anti-virus program?
21:35  MrUnagi: no
21:36  MrUnagi: unless you are paranoid......but even then it is still no
21:36  nubnub: ok, thanks
21:37  MrUnagi: silly viruses
21:38  MrUnagi: im gonna write a virus for ma
21:38  MrUnagi: mac
21:38  MrUnagi: when you run it, it will add a cron job to make a directory in your home folder called virus every minute....it will be epic
21:38  nubnub: why aren't there viruses for the mac?
21:38  MrUnagi: because mac is based on bsd, bsd is based on linux
21:39  g4bittin: bsd is based on unix not linux :D
21:39  MrUnagi: thats what i meant
21:39  nubnub: linux or unix?
21:39  MrUnagi: thank you :D
21:39  MrUnagi: unix
21:39  MrUnagi: but windows is not based on unix
21:39  MrUnagi: most of windows security measures is at the top levels of the software
21:39  nubnub: i knew it was based on unix, but i'm still not sure why macs cant get viruses
21:40  MrUnagi: there are many reasons....
21:40  MrUnagi: it isn't that they CAN'T get viruses, it is more that it is too difficult, and no benefit to writing them
21:40  MrUnagi: not to mention apple regularly updates the operating system to patch any exploits
21:41  MrUnagi: but any virus that does come out you end up having to put in your password 2 or 3 times for it to do it's thing, which to me isnt a virus
21:41  MrUnagi: g4bittin: how long has the mac filesystem of choice used acl?
21:41  g4bittin: MrUnagi: dunno
21:41  nubnub: ahh
21:41  MrUnagi: i imagine that has something to do with it
21:42  MrUnagi: people say if mac was more than 10% of the market, there would be viruses for it....and i don't buy it
21:43 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
21:45  MrUnagi: one piece of malware changes dns entries to include 2 ip addresses as the dns server, where they are redirected to phishing sites...
21:45  MrUnagi: this is betanews' idea of 'malware'
21:47  MrUnagi: this thread is saying that there are trojans, but trojans are not viruses
