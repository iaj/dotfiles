15:41  luist: parallels desktop any better than virutal box?
15:45  thedonvaughn: luist: not in my opinion.
15:45  thedonvaughn: virtualbox does just fine
15:45  luist: ok
15:45  thedonvaughn: er works just fine, rather
15:45  luist: do you think i can run games in virtual box windows?
15:46  luist: games like final fantasy 14
15:46  luist: i have a MBP core i7 4gb
15:49  thedonvaughn: that i'm not sure.  
15:49  thedonvaughn: parallels might be better for that :)
15:49  thedonvaughn: i don't play games, so my answer is probably biased
16:25  webPragmatist: that's pretty lame
16:25  webPragmatist: that you cant see the security type easily
16:28  Branes: luist: Gaming from inside a virtual machine is a waste of time, especially if the game you want to play was released some time in the last three years.
16:32  luist: whats cider?
16:34  Branes: A cop-out, basically. it is a software wrapper -- a program in its own right -- that chews up CPU time by watching a Windows program, intercepting any call for Direct3D, and turning it into an OpenGL call instead.
16:35  Branes: It's a cheap, nasty, inefficient way to "port" a Windows game over to the Mac.
16:46  luist: Branes: whats a good way to port a windows game over to the mac?
16:46  KaOSoFt: Redoing it.
16:46  Branes: The right way -- rewrite it from the ground up.
