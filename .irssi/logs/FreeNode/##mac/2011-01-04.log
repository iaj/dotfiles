11:33  abstrusenick: i dont have the entry in keychain and i always gets connected without asking to enter the passphrase
11:34 +crilly|w: Well that setup is down to the SSHd configuration and is actually an excellent level of security. I can only assume it stores th elocation of the passphras in the same location, or somewhere similar to Linux.
11:34 +crilly|w: Let's have a look... *googles*

13:54 +crilly|w: soahccc, that is correct, the MBA does come with an OS X USB pen for installing the base OS on. If you ask Apple for replacement media, they will issue a USB pen drive for a MBA.

15:20  matsebc: Hi got a question, is the magic mouse actually good for lets say, a developer? as in it wont hinder productivity compared to other mice?
15:20  Necrosan: Well, it's a mouse
15:21  Necrosan: They aren't the most comfortable I've heard (I've never used one personally)
15:21  Necrosan: But the functionality is apparently unparalleled.
15:22  matsebc: well considering the mbp trackpad does quite a good job, I want a mouse that will be comfortable, so far I´ve seen a MS one and the mighty mouse as candidates, and since they are both in the same price range I wanted to hear opinions, I´ve always had MS mice and honestly I think it´s the best thing they make, that´s quite a plus on the MS one
15:23 +crilly|w: I have a Mighty Mouse. I do not use it because it's too small and fiddly.
15:27  Necrosan: Yeah, the mighty mouse is junk
15:27  Necrosan: I got one for xmas a year or two ago
15:27  Necrosan: The trackball is the weakpoint
15:28 +crilly|w: trackball? oh sorry, I was thinking of the MagicMouse. My bad. I've never owned or used a might mouse, sorry.
15:30  ayaz: mighty mouse can be anything but "too small".
15:30  Necrosan: yeah, I was wondering
15:30  Necrosan: That thing fit my palm like a well stitched glove
15:34  ayaz: the nipple on the mighty mouse requires rough cleaning from time to time. that can get really frustrating. also, i have issues here and there with right click.
15:34  fujisan: anyone have a good way to remove remnants from apps that came with  a .pkg installer
15:34  fujisan: ?
15:35  matsebc: ops I ment magic mouse
15:35  matsebc: not mighty
15:35  matsebc: and thanks for the insight everyone
15:36 +crilly|w: fujisan, you could look at appclean or something.
15:37  fujisan: crilly|w:  i know but with pkg installers it will leave remnants in the system
15:38  fujisan: i used wiretap anywhere for a while uninstalled it with appzapper but when i do a say command in terminal.app it's evident that it left remnants
15:38  fujisan: os x really blows when uninstalling something
15:38  fujisan: i cant believe this :<
15:38 +crilly|w: :/
15:39  matsebc: question, I am unable to find my del key on my MBP
15:39  matsebc: there is no del key is there?
15:41  fujisan: crilly|w:  i am trying amnesia now from koingo
15:41  fujisan: it found 699 apps :<
15:41  fujisan: lol
15:43  fujisan: wow these apps totally screwed app my system
15:43 +crilly|w: matsebc, command+backspace.
15:43  fujisan: i cant believe it
15:43  fujisan: this is worse than windows registry
15:43  matsebc: crilly|w: awesome thanks
15:43  matsebc: fujisan: I´ve had my mini runing and installing stuff onto for 2 years now
15:43  matsebc: never had any kind of issues
15:44  matsebc: in fact yesterday I migrated the thing to my MBP
15:44  matsebc: and it works like a harm
15:44  matsebc: charm*
15:45  spknspell: lol fujisan
15:46  spknspell: fujisan: what is the say cmd to see app remnants?
15:47  fujisan: when i do a say command it shows library entries for apps like jackrouter and wiretap anywhere which i uninstalled months ago
15:47  fujisan: what a mess
15:48  spknspell: give me an example
15:49  spknspell: say nameofapp?
15:53  fujisan: https://img.skitch.com/20110104-817wija4193fwram6mg6he5n7k.jpg
15:54  spknspell: holy crap
15:54  fujisan: yep
15:54  spknspell: what are you gonna do about it
15:54  fujisan: dunno
15:54  spknspell: just write a script then upload for the channel
15:55  fujisan: what do you mean?
15:55  spknspell: say hi && rm *.hi blah
15:55  spknspell: ill manually del things from registry
15:55  kateweb: i just acidentily deleted a playlist , i tired to restore it by coping over the itunes music file from my timemachine back up from yeterday and it's missing all the changes i have made from at least the past month
15:55  fujisan: this happens because these apps were both .pkg installers
15:55  spknspell: which a lot are
15:55  kateweb: any ideas on how to fix it?
15:55  fujisan: and all these appclean type apps dont uninstall them properly
15:55  sanguisleft: lont time Linux user, that now has to use a mac at work, I will be here pestering yall for questions, thank you and sorry in advance
15:55  fujisan: not even appzapper
15:55  spknspell: right
15:56  spknspell: right
15:56  spknspell: guess yer stuck manually doing it
15:56  kateweb: make that past 3 months
15:56  fujisan: you mean just delete those dirs?
15:57  spknspell: the ones tht pertain to the app
15:57  spknspell: only so far in
15:57  spknspell: or up on the heirarchy

15:57  fujisan: only do far in?
15:57  spknspell: ive never messed with it
15:57  spknspell: del the wiretap.plugin file
15:58  fujisan: everyone who says the windows registry sucks and who crosses my path will be shown this url for those errors :<
15:58  spknspell: YES
15:58  kateweb: also the xml file seems not to be in the backup just the db file
15:59  Necrosan: Don't you guys just love staring an xml file right in the eyes

16:01  kateweb: well imhopeing finding it will recover the last 3 months worth of work
16:01  kateweb: as i thought this was what back ups were for
16:02  pgpkeys: spknspell: not Storage Area Network. san is a sign of equality, sama is a sign of someone being considered an elder or in a position of superiority. Mainly used by Japanaese
16:02  spknspell: ah yes
16:02  pgpkeys: friendsan, bosssama
16:02  spknspell: danielsan
16:02  pgpkeys: yeah
16:02  spknspell: call me spknsama
16:03  spknspell: osama
16:03  pgpkeys: if said by 2 people of equal position its san. if said by a boss its san. if said by the underling its sama. if a kid talking to an adult, it sama.
16:03  spknspell: ok ok
16:03  pgpkeys: :)
16:04  pgpkeys: sorry. position makes a BIG difference (actually its THE difference) is why i clarified 
16:04  pgpkeys: and with that.. off for a cig

16:44  kukosk: hi all … i have a macbook pro with the i5 processor … im thinking about upgrading the ram to 8gb … would you buy 1066mhz ones? or rather 1333 ones ? if the 1333 has CL 9 and 1066 has CL7… will the macbook handle the 1333 ? why does apple put 1066ones in there by default ?
16:45 +crilly|w: Does the Apple website say that the MBP model you have will support 1333MHz chips?
16:45  kukosk: i didnt find it there, that's why im asking here
16:46  simplicity-: So..
16:46 +crilly|w: SO it won't support them. I'd be safe and just get 1033MHz chips.
16:46  simplicity-: If the socket fits, it's pretty much the same if you buy 1066 or 1333, the 1333 will downclock to 1066.
16:47 +crilly|w: I have 8GB of DDR3 1066MHz chips in my C2d MBP 13" and it's lightening fast.
16:47  kukosk: yes, i know it will be downclocked … but it will then be the same as the 1066 ones, but will have higher cas latency
16:47  simplicity-: Found my 8GB in the mail box when i got home 10 mins ago..
16:47  kukosk: so thats why im asking ....
16:47  simplicity-: Now just awaiting an Optibay to complete my MBP upgrade.
16:52  kukosk: ill replace them myself
16:53 +crilly|w: Yeah I fitted my own RAM, too.
16:56  kukosk: btw, it's a big difference between 7 and 9 cas latency ?
16:56 +crilly|w: No ida. Probably not.
16:57 +crilly|w: You're not NASA, so you don't need to worry about such things.
16:57  kukosk: yes, but im thinking about which to buy :)
16:58  kukosk: i red some forums and thay say i won't see any difference
16:58  kukosk: but on the crucial.com website, the one with 1066mhz is more expensive than 1333 one
16:59  zooky: kukosk: most people wouldn't even notice the difference between cas 7 and 9. 
16:59  zooky: unless their computer only recognized one and not the other lol
17:00  kukosk: heh
17:01  kukosk: thank you, i will probably go the 1333 way. as i may replace my macbook sometimes and itll be better to have 1333
17:01  zooky: well will all your ram be 1333? because if one stick is lower; they all drop down in speed
17:02  kukosk: im gona buy two same pieces. together its 8gb. but it'll probably run @ 1066 as macbook pro i5 cpu seems to not support 1333 yet

18:41  bittin: this should be the right drivers?
18:42  bittin: do i need to have airport or something installed?
18:42 +zer0her0: airport is a wireless card, if you had it installed you wouldn't need the adapter ;)
18:42 +zer0her0: bittin: try pluggin it in another computer, or plug another usb device into the port to make sure 1) the device is ok, and 2) the port is good
18:44  bittin: zer0her0: ah sorry :p
18:44 +zer0her0: bittin: i'll let it slide
18:45 +zer0her0: ...this time
18:45  fujisano: i hanged my wirelessrouter in a pouchbag from the peg and the signal is excellent now although it looks kinda funny :<
18:45  fujisano: i need straps
18:45  fujisano: if i had some i could it on the wall higher
18:46  PhilipPhilip: need help people, major problem in my network.  Airport isn't detecting a single solitairy god damn thing, even though my router is up and running well, what the hell, please help before I punch this macbook so hard in the face it'll cry windows
18:47 +zer0her0: PhilipPhilip: here's an idea maybe more description of what you tried and less whatever that was.
18:48  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: Airport isn't detecting my router.
18:49 +zer0her0: yes thankfully i was able to discern that much, have you tried for instance restarting router? restarting computer? plugging directly into the router? tried a different router?
18:49  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: Yes, Yes, No and No.
18:50  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: Sorry, Yes, yes, yes and no.
18:50  PhilipPhilip: connection works plugge din
18:50 +zer0her0: was it working previously?
18:50  PhilipPhilip: It was indeed, yes.
18:50  PhilipPhilip: Up to an hour ago. than BAM!!!!! Nothing.
18:51  PhilipPhilip: s/than/then/
18:51 +zer0her0: i'd say you may want to try to see if you can connect to another wireless network or even see one
18:51  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: Yes, quite right, it won't even see networks.
18:52  PhilipPhilip: "scanning.... "  - nothing, nada, zilch, zip
18:52 +zer0her0: and you know there are others in the area?
18:52  PhilipPhilip: My andriod phone has told me
18:52  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: ^
18:52 +zer0her0: nice.
18:53  PhilipPhilip: zer0her0: Yep, HTC desire.  Rooooted.
18:53 +zer0her0: PhilipPhilip: i'd say you want to test w/ a known good system, either via reinstall or booting off a hard drive or such.
18:53 +zer0her0: PhilipPhilip: i rock a N1 and a Droid.
18:53  PhilipPhilip: (even got fedora running on it
18:53 +zer0her0: ok gf is here for lunch, gotta run, sorry.
18:53  PhilipPhilip: Ok bye
18:54  SeySayux: Hi, any idea why my boot camp partition doesn't show up in my list of bootable devices? I can boot fine with the built-in bootloader.

19:21  MrUnagi: no one loves me either
19:21  MrUnagi: not even my mom
19:23  pgpkeys: man now that does suck. I'm a proud mamma's boy. Love my mom to death :)
19:25  MrUnagi: i love your mom too
19:25  pgpkeys: heh my mom would rip you to shreds :)
19:25  Macstheyjustsuck: How the hell
19:25  MrUnagi: thats why i love her
19:25  Macstheyjustsuck: Everytime I come in here there's discussion about other people
19:25  Macstheyjustsuck: people's mothers
19:26  MrUnagi: does it bother you Macstheyjustsuck ?
19:27  Macstheyjustsuck: No, I start it most of the time
19:28  Macstheyjustsuck: I was just aggravated this time because I wanted to be the one that started it :[
19:38  MrUnagi: by all means
19:40  Macstheyjustsuck: Your mom has means.
19:40  jarek: hi
19:40 +ChrisAM: hi
19:41  MrUnagi: hi
19:41  Macstheyjustsuck: hi
19:41  jarek: does anybody here know whether Apple will be accepting webapps in Mac App Store?
19:41  MrUnagi: yes
19:41  MrUnagi: no
19:41  CEnTR4L: lol
19:41  MrUnagi: what?
19:41  jarek: great!
19:41  jarek: so yes or no?
19:41  MrUnagi: exactly
19:41 +ChrisAM: what would be distributed from the app store for a web app? a hyperlink?
19:42  MrUnagi: what is a webapp
19:42  MrUnagi: a webpage?
19:42  jarek: they say that apps should follow mac interface guidelines, but they don't specify which framework/toolkit should be used
19:42  CEnTR4L: Anybody knows why when connecting to a personal VPN I can't browse with the server's IP?
19:42  jarek: ChrisAM: it would be an app written completely in JS/CSS/HTML5, but it would be standalone (no link)
19:42 +ChrisAM: put it in the cloud... that's the new hotness
19:43  jarek: ChrisAM: but I have no marketing
19:43  MrUnagi: i think the cloud is stupid
19:43  jarek: ChrisAM: I can't sell an app that nobody has heard about
19:43  jarek: ChrisAM: at least not outside App Store or simillar places
19:43  CEnTR4L: Yes you can!
19:43  jarek: CEnTR4L: how do I spread the word about it?
19:44  jarek: CEnTR4L: I don't really have time to market it :/
19:44  CEnTR4L: When I use it and post about it in my twitter timeline and some famous tweep sees it and retweet it, everybody is going to know about it.
19:44 +ChrisAM: CEnTR4L ... what do you mean?
19:44  jarek: I don't even have twitter account :|
19:45  CEnTR4L: ChrisAM, my friend has setup a VPN in his shell account, it works in iPhone
19:45  jarek: btw, are there any restriction on App Store when it comes to the developer place of origin?
19:45  MrUnagi: jarek: that is why you fail
19:45  jarek: for example I can't sell apps on Android Market
19:45  CEnTR4L: But in Mac OS it connects but never surfs the web with its IP
19:46  jarek: it's also not allowed for me to sell my app on Chrome Web Store
19:46  jarek: because I'm outside US
19:46  MrUnagi: jarek: that doesnt make sense
19:46 * CEnTR4L running a very low battery
19:46 * CEnTR4L going to disconnect in any second
19:46  MrUnagi: ive seen foreign apps
19:47  jarek: MrUnagi: yes, but those were free apps
19:47  jarek: MrUnagi: at least on Chrome Web Store only US citizen can sell apps
19:47  MrUnagi: jarek: sucks to live outside the us
19:47  jarek: on Android Market the list of countries is a bit bigger: http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=150324
19:47  CEnTR4L: Indeed Unagi
19:48  jarek: I wonder how the situation look on App Store
19:48  jarek: I can't find any information
19:48  jarek: actually, I don't even have mac yet
19:48 +ChrisAM: MrUnagi ... you might need to make a static route for that
19:48  jarek: I'm going to buy it only after I know I can sell apps for it :P
19:49  jarek: is it hard for JavaScript developer to learn Objective-C?
19:50  jarek: I guess I will have to use it at least to embed Webkit window
20:00  webPragmatist: more reasons why application based windowing sucks......
20:01  webPragmatist: actually i won't go into this today

20:10  jarek: MrUnagi: mac hardware is heavily overpriced, I really don't see any benefits
20:10 --- Tua_Scoot_ is now known as Tua_Scoot
20:10  MrUnagi: jarek: because you do not own one
20:10  torchie: mac isn't hardware
20:10  MrUnagi: jarek: are you telling me that you LIKE windows?
20:11  jarek: MrUnagi: I was using Linux for the last 10 years
20:11  MrUnagi: linux is too much hassle and not adopted well enough
20:11  pgpkeys: hah!
20:11  MrUnagi: yup
20:11  jarek: MrUnagi: not if you are used to it
20:11  pgpkeys: that is SO wrong, but I'll leave it alone
20:12  MrUnagi: jarek: i am used to it
20:12  jarek: MrUnagi: switching to different operating system is always a hassle, no matter whether you are using Windows, OSX or Linux
20:12  MrUnagi: ok pgpkeys when they come out with a driver for the hauppauge tv tuner i have, then i will say it is widely adopted
20:12  MrUnagi: jarek: who said anything about switching
20:12  MrUnagi: jarek: i used it exclusively 
20:12  pgpkeys: when hauppage releases a DRIVER for it they will
20:13  jarek: MrUnagi: by switching I meant dumping the old os and replacing it with the new one
20:13  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: that is my point
20:13  MrUnagi: jarek: replacing what old os
20:13  pgpkeys: that has absolutely nothing to do with linux since linux is opensource and the driver companies are close sourced
20:13 +zer0her0: ah back from my first lunch at the new place
20:13  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: ok?
20:13  jarek: MrUnagi: it doesn't matter what old os
20:13  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: i still can't get a driver for it
20:13  pgpkeys: and most of the tuner companies are SPECIFICALLY targetting windows
20:13  MrUnagi: jarek: you arent making sense
20:13 +zer0her0: a 5 minute walk is much cooler then 15 minute drive and 10 minute job of find parking every morning
20:14  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: most of the hardware companies target windows
20:14  MrUnagi: you are just making my point for me
20:14  pgpkeys: no they don't just target windows
20:14  MrUnagi: ok
20:14  pgpkeys: akak your MOST
20:14  jarek: MrUnagi: I just disagree with you that switching from Windows or Linux to OSX is any easier the the other way
20:14  jarek: s/the the/than
20:14  MrUnagi: jarek: i didnt say anything about switching being hard
20:15  pgpkeys: When linux started being shipped preinstalled by several MAJOR players such as Dell, Linux ceased being 'not widely adopted' 
20:15  jarek: <MrUnagi> linux is too much hassle and not adopted well enough
20:15  torchie: didn't dell stop shipping linux
20:15  jarek: ok, you were not saying about switching
20:15  pgpkeys: torchie: no
20:15  MrUnagi: so a couple of oddball systems shipping with ubuntu, linux is widely adopted
20:15  pgpkeys: mrunagi: uhh the CPx is HARDLY an oddball system
20:15  S_SubZero: they made the links to the linux boxes so obscure that only linux people can find it
20:16  torchie: CPx?
20:16  pgpkeys: not to mention that IBM directly supports linux as well as an installation option for the Thinkpads
20:16  MrUnagi: has anyone heard of CPx
20:16  pgpkeys: torchie: series
20:16  S_SubZero: IBM.  Thinkpads.
20:16  MrUnagi: lol
20:16  MrUnagi: doesnt lenovo own thinkpad now?
20:16  S_SubZero: "now" meaning "for the last several years" yes
20:17 * MrUnagi is on dell trying to find linux computers
20:17  torchie: thiknpads are still p sweet
20:17  jarek: Dell has overpriced hardware too :P
20:17  pgpkeys: holy shit don't you guys know your part numbers at all? sheesh the CPx series are the Dell Latitudes
20:17  torchie_pre: oh.
20:17  pgpkeys: one of dells BEST selling brands
20:17  MrUnagi: yea i spend my time masturbating to the dell product sheet
20:17  torchie_pre: why didn't you just say latitude
20:17  MrUnagi: dell SUCKS....
20:17 +zer0her0: dell stopped shipping linux on consumer machines
20:18 +zer0her0: they're still shipping servers and business machines w/ linux
20:18  MrUnagi: zer0her0: is that why i cant find it?
20:18  torchie_pre: because then I would understand
20:18  MrUnagi: so....back to my original statement...
20:18  MrUnagi: i will chat with a rep
20:18 +zer0her0: MrUnagi: find what?
20:18  MrUnagi: she will be able to show me a linux computer
20:18 +zer0her0: sorry just got in from lunch
20:19  pgpkeys: zer0her0: businesses purchase more than consumers do, to include support contracts. the reason they stopped on the consumer side wasn't due to lack of support by the company, but because it was mainly businesses asking for linux
20:19  torchie_pre: I know there's still system76
20:19  torchie_pre: who aparently sells rebranded acers
20:19  MrUnagi: zer0her0: i am being proved wrong on my statement that linux is too much of a hassle and not widely adopted among hardware manufacturers
20:19 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: hmm?
20:19 +zer0her0: MrUnagi: ah depends on how you define widely
20:19  jarek: MrUnagi: so what makes macs "more adopted" and "less hassle" for example for a web developer?
20:20 +zer0her0: torchie_pre: they sell rebranded whatever they can get Ubuntu on in different size categories
20:20  pgpkeys: I'll just step back while you believe waht you want. 
20:20  MrUnagi: zer0her0: for me, when i get a driver for my tv tuner
20:20  jarek: MrUnagi: I install and run Apache/PHPMyadmin/PHP on Ubuntu with one command
20:20 +zer0her0: MrUnagi: how uses tv tuners?
20:20  jarek: s/I/I can
20:20  MrUnagi: i am speaking with mohammad at dell
20:20  pgpkeys: zer0her0: yeah like alienware is reselling rebranded dells
20:20 +zer0her0: s/how/who/
20:20  torchie_pre: if canonical did their own consumer hardware design and distribution
20:20  MrUnagi: jarek: great, you probably can on mac too
20:20  torchie_pre: we'd have a competitor to apple :D
20:20 +zer0her0: torchie_pre: that would be interesting, but i doubt it'll happen
20:21  MrUnagi: zer0her0: not me anymore
20:21  pgpkeys: zer0her0: hehe was my point too. tv tuners are niche hardware. NOT a commonplace device either in consumer land OR in the business world
20:21 +zer0her0: i don't understand why people are so afraid to make their own vertical supply stack like Apple?!
20:21  jarek: MrUnagi: and how do I run IE8 on mac to test my websites?
20:21  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: oh ok so they don't make a linux flavor specifically for home theater pcs
20:21  torchie_pre: because they have no balls
20:21  webPragmatist: you know what would be badass
20:21 +zer0her0: jarek: WINE, VM, or Bootcamp
20:21  webPragmatist: if i could put stacks in my doc and not have it on the right side
20:21  webPragmatist: dock
20:21  jarek: MrUnagi: also, does OSX file manager allow for browsing files with SSH/FTP/SFTP?
20:21  MrUnagi: so basically, macs, and windows based pcs, are both great home theater computers.....but linux is not
20:21  MrUnagi: BECAUSE IT ISNT WIDELY ACCEPTED
20:21  torchie_pre: and would rather whore out android and windows to everything with a processor
20:22  MrUnagi: case closed
20:22  MrUnagi: jarek: yes it does
20:22 +zer0her0: MrUnagi: my HTC is running a linux kernel and it runs great
20:22 +zer0her0: as is my home server
20:22  MrUnagi: zer0her0: awesome
20:22  S_SubZero: last time I tried ubuntu I had issues and couldn't get flash at 1080p working well so meh
20:22  pgpkeys: mrunagi: the mythOS. not to mention do you know how MUCH of the networking device-land uses linux as their embedded OS??
20:22  jarek: MrUnagi: does Finder support tabbed browsing? :P
20:22  pgpkeys: hahahaha
20:22  webPragmatist: jarek: with totalfinder yes
20:22  MrUnagi: jarek: who cares about tabbed browsing in a file system
20:23  pgpkeys: nevermind. you CLEARLY do not understand the market
20:23  MrUnagi: mohammad: Bryan unfortunately in do not have systems with Linux on consumer segment computers
20:23  MrUnagi: oh yea, widely accepted
20:23  jarek: MrUnagi: I can't imagine working with file manager without tabs
20:23  jarek: MrUnagi: it's just like using web browser without tabs
20:23  MrUnagi: jarek: i cant imagine needing too
20:23  MrUnagi: jarek: not really
20:23 +zer0her0: jarek: i've never seen a need for tabbed file management
20:24  torchie_pre: tabbed file management what
20:24 +zer0her0: unlike a web browser where i'm generally reading and therefore can hide unread content behind a tab, w/ a file manager i'm moving files around
20:24 +zer0her0: tabs hinders this process.
20:24  pgpkeys: again, dell already said they were dropping linux for the CONSUMER MARKET because the BUSINESS COMMUNITY was the one that was requesting it the most so they were retargetting for the business side of the house. But, business, even though they account for over 70% of most major manufacturers' orders, are requesting linux on servers and laptops because its 'not widely accepted'
20:24  jarek: are there virtual desktops in OSX?
20:24  pgpkeys: heheh thats funny
20:25  S_SubZero: Spaces
20:25 +zer0her0: jarek: what S_SubZero said, it's called spaces
20:28  torchie_pre: well
20:28  torchie_pre: I'm gonna jet before my battery explodes
20:29  torchie_pre: that said spaces is my favorite virtual desktop implementation
20:29  torchie_pre: gasp!
20:31 --- jarek is now known as Guest63743
20:35  MrUnagi: did i offend jarek
20:37  spknspell: i think so
20:37  MrUnagi: he should get over it
20:37  MrUnagi: i should have mentioned that i currently run linux lol
20:38  pgpkeys: well its a mac channel so it doesn't really matter. but just cause its a mac channel doesn't mean dissing other OSs is acceptable. unless of course you prefer to be an elitist which most of us don't
20:39  MrUnagi: i only 'diss' windows, because it is garbage
20:39  spknspell: ok
20:40  MrUnagi: i guess i apologize if saying linux is too much of a hassle and not very widely adopted was a diss....
20:40  pgpkeys: damn it, my toaster just blew one side of it
20:40  Angostura: Windows 7 isn't particularly garbagy
20:40  MrUnagi: Angostura: heh
20:41  pgpkeys: the hassle part was fine, the widly adopted part is most than a ittle false and is a diss in most regards
20:41  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: i guess that is subject to opinion....apparently my example is 'niche' and that is pretentious
20:42  MrUnagi: the only people that said that were ones that had nothing else to say and didnt personally use their box for HT
20:43  MrUnagi: i would venture to say that HTPC is as 'niche' as gaming, and I don't really consider gaming a 'niche'
20:44  pgpkeys: well lets also look at the fact that linux supports actual hardware. not devices that hav a stub on an eprom and the actual driver workings in a DLL library ONLY such as certain Promise RAID cards, winmodems, etc. and those are low quality low end devices
20:46 +crilly: Can anyone recommend an application for connecting to a Cisco switch via a a USB->COM port convertor?
20:46  pgpkeys: especially to since major players such as tivo use linux for their embedded kernel for their devices. and tivo is very much NOT a niche, low end, or non-widely-used
20:47  MrUnagi: crilly: for terminal access?
20:47 +crilly: MrUnagi: Yes.
20:47  MrUnagi: you cant do it through the terminal?
20:48 +crilly: What? I'm trying to access the terminal.
20:48  MrUnagi: crilly: you are trying to access the IOS terminal from your mac correct?
20:48 +crilly: It's a fresh switch, so you only have physical serial port access and you have to configure and enable telnet/ssh.
20:49  pgpkeys: crilly: in linux you could use minicom
20:49  pgpkeys: not sure if macports or brew has that
20:49 +crilly: pgpkeys: and in Windows I could use PuTTY :(
20:49  MrUnagi: that is what i am trying to say
20:49  MrUnagi: is it not just a tty interface
20:49 +crilly: No.
20:50 +crilly: pgpkeys: There's a UNIX port of PuTTY. I could try compiling it. hmm
20:50  pgpkeys: putty is just connecting via telnet isn't it?
20:50  MrUnagi: crilly: what you are searching for is something like hyperterminal
20:50  pgpkeys: well if you just have serial access, then minicom or sgetty would work
20:51  LzrdKing: unix port of putty? you mean a terminal?
20:51  MrUnagi: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080218140558128
20:51  MrUnagi: crilly: ^^^
20:51  LzrdKing: pgpkeys: putty does ssh too
20:51  MrUnagi: LzrdKing: but telnet ssh wont work until configured on the switch
20:51  pgpkeys: lzrdking: i know what putty does
20:51  pgpkeys: i was meaning how he accesses the switch
20:52  MrUnagi: pgpkeys: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080218140558128 looks promising
20:52  pgpkeys: lzrdking: hehe I've been to this roadio more than a few times
20:52  LzrdKing: i was referring to "of PuTTY. I could try compiling it. hmm
20:52  MrUnagi: rodeo?
20:52  LzrdKing: 14:50 <<+crilly> pgpkeys: There's a UNIX port of PuTTY.
20:53 +crilly: MrUnagi: OS X Server based.
20:53  pgpkeys: yes. putty was originally written to duplicate the ssh/telnet/sftp/et al features available under unix. however, most people also loved the splistic interface so the app was ported back to linux
20:53  LzrdKing: there are lots of TTY programs for UNIX
20:53  MrUnagi: crilly: that is leopard server based
20:53 +crilly: I'm not using Leopard Server.
20:54  MrUnagi: what are you using
20:54  MrUnagi: btw minicom is on macports
20:54  MrUnagi: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1422078&tstart=0
20:54  MrUnagi: crilly: what are you using
20:55 +crilly: I'm using Snow Leopard.
20:55  pgpkeys: crilly: you can also use getty to connect the port to /bin/login (see /etc/gettytab) and then use minicom to speak to it or linputty
20:56  MrUnagi: crilly: and you think leopard to snow leopard is so drastic of a change that this method wouldnt work
20:56 +crilly: I don't want Linux or UNIX applications - I want an application for OS X/
20:56 +crilly: MrUnagi: Given that a critical component, "/usr/libexec/serial/SerialTerminalSupport" doesn't exist in SL, yeah I do.
20:56  MrUnagi: crilly: um ok
20:57 +crilly: Unless they moved it. I'm trying to find it.

20:58  MrUnagi: lol pgpkeys 
20:58  MrUnagi: brb
20:59  pgpkeys: crilly: there is also http://www.macwise.com/
21:02 +crilly: Thanks guys :)
21:02  pgpkeys: yep :)
21:03 +crilly: Gonna install the required drivers and run through that guide now. I borrowed two SP->USB adaptors. I just hope they actually work.
21:03 +crilly: If all else fails, I'll just take all my stuff into work and use my PC there, or buy a second-hand Thinkpad or something.
21:03  pgpkeys: heheh
21:04 +crilly: rebooting

21:12 +crilly: No such luck I'm afraid guys. Thanks for the help though
21:12  sanguisleft: I just installed mac fuse but when I type sshfs no function is found, how do I mount a remote dive als local over ssh?
21:14 +crilly: pgpkeys, MrUnagi: it was likely the serial-port -> USB devices I had. The best ones to get have the PL-2303 chipset on them. I ordered on on the 13th December, but it's from the US so it will take time to get here (if it gets here).
21:16 +crilly: sanguisleft: have you tried the 'mount' commands? Type "mount" and hit tab twice.
21:19  simplicity-: hmm.. Is it normal that launchd uses 700MB ram?
21:19  simplicity-: hmm.. i think it's safari in descise.
21:20  simplicity-: yep, sure was.
21:20 +crilly: pgpkeys: Sounds silly but do you know of a really cheap laptop, doesn't matter how old, that has a serial port and is REALLY cheap? I want something simply for running around and configuring switches and routers via the serial port - nothing more.
21:20  sanguisleft: crilly: thanx thats is somthing bt there is no _sshfs or even _ssh
21:38  MrUnagi: seems silly to require a pc to access a cisco terminak
21:38  MrUnagi: terminal
21:40 +crilly: Not really. It's a security measure. You can disable telnet/ssh access and lock the switch in a cabinet inside a locked comms room. It's very secure then.
21:41 +ChrisAM: crilly ... you can get a USB serial adapter.
21:41 +ChrisAM: or better yet, get a raritan or avocent cat5 kvm with serial adapters.
21:41 +crilly: Oh really? Like the two I have in my hand? The same two we've been talking about?
21:49 +crilly: Windows only detected one of them, implying the other is buggered. <yoda> No drivers could Windows find for the Serial2USB device you have</yoda>
22:15  joobie: guys is there decent free software to convert xvid to dvd?
22:16  spknspell: dvdx2anything
22:16  Angostura: crilly: I seem to recall that someone has produced a iPad, iPod Touch serial adaptor specifically for people who want to config boxes
22:17  joobie: spknspell, got a link? 
22:17  spknspell: hold on lookup the name of the prog again
22:17  joobie: google is not showing that in a high link
22:17  joobie: thanks
22:18  joobie: btw does it keep similar quality to the divx after conversion?
22:18  joobie: is it decent?
22:18  spknspell: yea
22:20  spknspell: oh its convertxtodvd
22:21  joobie: that's paid?
22:21  joobie: and for windows
22:21  spknspell: oh
22:21  spknspell: try it in wine or crossover
22:21  joobie: it's paid :()
22:22  spknspell: theres a trial
22:22  spknspell: meh idk theres a million diff ways

23:31  neverblue: hi, someone had a suggestion for me to try
23:31  neverblue: i have setup iTunes as a Home Share, under my main user's account
23:31  neverblue: but when another user logs in, before I do, the library will not be accessible
23:32  neverblue: someone suggested, I create a service which runs iTunes as my user, when the other user(s) login
23:32  neverblue: is that possible ?
