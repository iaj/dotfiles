10:33  engla: hi everyone. today after 5 1/2 years of service, my ibook g4's lcd backlight died. Anyone have experience with that?
10:34  engla: I plan to maybe open it up and see if it's just a worn cable in the hinge.. it sounds probable

15:33  |REM|: hey guys, i have an employee with a remote mac that we are letting go and I want to log in remotely and wipe the machine before they know whats going on.  What's the best way to do that?
15:34  eagles0513875: hey
15:35  eagles0513875: |REM|: why not tell him you need to reformat it as its company policy to back up any of his data and just be up front about it
15:37  Kasm279|Away: |REM|: you can't
15:37  Kasm279|Away: unless they have SSH or desktop sharing on that is
15:37  Kasm279|Away: if either is on then connect
15:38  Kasm279|Away: in ther terminal one just do rm -rf /
15:38  Kasm279|Away: int he desktop sharing one, open terminal then do the command
15:41  |REM|: my access is through a VNC type program that they have to accept me when I try to log on
15:41  |REM|: so my concern is that they would see what I was doing and just turn off the machine
15:42  |REM|: but if I could turn on ssh access then I could ssh in without them knowing and then start the rm -rf from there right?
15:42  Kasm279|Away: they would see that you are turning it on
15:42  Kasm279|Away: but seriosuoly |REM|
15:42  |REM|: thats fine, they arent spart enough to know that part of it
15:42  Kasm279|Away: just talk to him and format it in person
15:42  |REM|: cant
15:43  Kasm279|Away: why?
15:43  |REM|: im in ny and they are in hawaii
15:43  Kasm279|Away: well
15:43  Kasm279|Away: call them and tell them to accept the thing
15:43  Kasm279|Away: then format it
15:43  Kasm279|Away: but tell them what you are going
15:43  |REM|: and they have a lot of sensitive data and have done some things that are a gross misconduct and the worry is that they will try to contact clients
15:44  Kasm279|Away: did you contact your supervisor?
15:44  |REM|: i work directly with the ceo
15:44  |REM|: and this is what he is telling me to do =)
15:44  Kasm279|Away: anyway
15:44  Kasm279|Away: i can't think of anything
15:44  eagles0513875: cant you disable the users account
15:44  eagles0513875: so he cant login to steal any data
15:44  |REM|: i will be logged in as that user
15:44  eagles0513875: also my question is there a way to set thunderbird to use the address book that comes with osx
15:45  eagles0513875: |REM|: are you the IT admin or something of that nature
15:45  |REM|: i am
15:45  Kasm279|Away: well looks like i gotta get going, later
15:45  eagles0513875: |REM|: you should then have admin account
15:45  |REM|: thanks for the info
15:46  |REM|: yeh but i cant log out with the remote software we use.
15:46  |REM|: anyway, thanks for the ideas =)
15:47  Kasm279|Away: |REM|: wait
15:47  Kasm279|Away: it gives you VNC access right?
15:47  Kasm279|Away: apple>logout
15:49  kaushal: Hi
15:50  kaushal: I suppose Mac OS is written primarly in "C"
15:52  kaushal: Am i correct ?
15:53  theworkpatrol: it's written entirely in Steve Jobs
15:53  kaushal: :/
15:54  theworkpatrol: heh sorry, i don't actually know the answer
15:54 * derp is at a Apple store 
15:54  kaushal: theworkpatrol: dont troll please
15:55  theworkpatrol: derp, buying something nice?
15:55  bassliner: kaushal: primarily yes.
15:55  bassliner: kaushal: some parts are written in scripting languages of course.
15:57  Marctraider: goodday
16:11  zer0her0: theworkpatrol: awesome response to Mac OS written in question
16:11  zer0her0: derp: why are you IRCing from an Apple store?!
16:11  zer0her0: kaushal: Mac OS is written in a number of different languages either C or Obj-C being the majority of the code

17:22  vxla: zer0her0: if you're talking the actual BSD OS, I'd say it's equal amounts of C and C++
17:27  tsmith: I have a program I cannot close.  How do I view a list of programs and force-quit it?
17:27  vxla:  activity monitor?
17:28  vxla: i just use ps(1) on the command line.
17:28  tsmith: where is activity monitor?
17:28  vxla: in Utilities
17:30  tsmith: vxia, that was it, thanks!!!
17:36  zer0her0: vxla: Mac OS X is about as far from BSD as you can get these days though
17:36  vxla: really?
17:36  vxla: expain.
17:36  vxla: s/pain/plain/
17:41  zer0her0: http://clusterize.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Unix_history-simple_20021.png
17:42  zer0her0: it was forked in 2000 from early freeBSD 3.x
17:42  vxla: yes it was.
17:43  vxla: but Apple hasn't made any real changes to the BSD portions of the operating system.
17:43  vxla: certainly they haven't optimized or re-written the TCP/IP stack.
17:43  vxla: thankfully.
17:44  zer0her0: one part of the OS does not make it so for the whole OS
17:44  zer0her0: there is alot we don't see the code to
17:44  zer0her0: i have to run, blackhawk flight in an hour
17:44  vxla: I get the feeling you don't understand the architecture of the platform
17:44  zer0her0: i get the feeling you don't understand the difference between kernel and OS
17:44  zer0her0: ;)
17:44  vxla: right
17:45  vxla: let me know when you've written a single patch or line of code that's made it into an operational kernel. cheers
17:45  Tu13es: zer0her0: yes i'd like to know as well
17:46  zer0her0: vxla: i can explain tonight if people really need me to play teacher but right now i have a training excercise to attend.
17:46  zer0her0: er Tu13es i meant
17:46  Tu13es: no i mean i'd like to know when you've written a yada yada yada
17:47  vxla: zer0her0: please don't provide misinformation through diagrams and things you've read on Mac Rumors.
17:47  Tu13es: zer0her0: have you ever even used a Mac?
17:47  zer0her0: Tu13es: what's a mac
17:47  Tu13es: shrug
