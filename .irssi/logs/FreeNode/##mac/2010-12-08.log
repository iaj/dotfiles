00:01  LordDragon: yeah but.. its also a hitachi
00:01  LordDragon: lol
00:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraX]
00:03  LordDragon: [17:53:47]  <alexlea> LordDragon: drive only? or insinde an enclosure

00:10  LordDragon: ah ok. wasnt sure
00:11  alexlea: right now i am in starbucks and some dude is using a macbook and an ipad at the same time...i see this at least once a week...and that is why i cant understand having so many devices
00:11  LordDragon: alexlea, cuz they all have strengths and weaknesses. having both gives you the best of both worlds
00:12  alexlea: ipad, imo, has no advanatge over a laptop other than its just cool...
00:12  alexlea: all the ios devices are cool
00:13  b0o-yeah: alexlea: gaming on ipad is WIN :)
00:14  alexlea: i liked gaming on the touch... for awhile anyway... chop sushi was my fav
00:18  Kasm279: whoo
00:18  Kasm279: OSX DP1
00:18  Kasm279: err
00:18  Kasm279: DP2
00:19  b0o-yeah: Lion?
00:20  Kasm279: b0o-yeah: no
00:21  Kasm279: like OSX DP2
00:21  Kasm279: OSX, not a specific version
00:21  Kasm279: b0o-yeah: this http://www.guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/macosxdp2
00:21  b0o-yeah: huh? DP = developer preview I assume? so I assume its a DP of lion
00:22  Kasm279: no
00:22  b0o-yeah: oh history
00:22  Kasm279: not of lion
00:22  Kasm279: :P
00:24  b0o-yeah: Did I mention "The Net" is my favorite mac nostalgia movie ;)
00:24  b0o-yeah: mostly because Sandra Bullock is using the macs 
00:25  Kasm279: lmao
00:25  LordDragon: indeed
00:25  Kasm279: i need to crack OSX PB
00:25  Kasm279: so it doesn't expire
00:25  LordDragon: PB ?
00:25  Kasm279: public beta
00:26  LordDragon: that would be illegal
00:26  Kasm279: ?
00:26  Kasm279: how so?
00:26  b0o-yeah: in Kasm279's country they have no word for illegal 
00:26 * Kasm279 is in the US
00:26  Kasm279: anyway
00:26  b0o-yeah: lies
00:27  Kasm279: how would it be illegal?
00:27  LordDragon: its not supposed to be used past its expiration. its beta
00:28  Kasm279: and the software that it was meant to expire for was free
00:28  Kasm279: when you bought the beta
00:28  Kasm279: just shipping costs
00:33  Kasm279: oh ffs boot
00:38  alexlea: LordDragon: i htink i am gonna pimp out my macbook...drill holes in it, attach flashing blinky lights, etc
00:38  LordDragon: alexlea, lol ok but why?
00:39  LordDragon: alexlea, i think ur messing with me :P
00:39  alexlea: LordDragon: cause it's old already... might as well. i need to take it apart and take out the optical drive (its broken...so i wither need to fix it or just trash it) if its completely broken and i remove it that gives me space to do something
00:40  alexlea: LordDragon: i also need to silicone up all the cracks...like the botton has a huge crack in it from where i dropped it
00:40  ae86-drifter: hey there i got some imacs with user account with a space in it i.e. /Users/XXX XXX/....., need to convert it to a dot instead because sometimes causes problems. authentication is through AD. can change AD side of things fine but want to keep the users home folder, could someone please help?
00:41  alexlea: copy the home folder, and then put it in the new user account
00:41  LordDragon: alexlea, will you tie them into the battery? or include a seperate powersupply?
00:42  ae86-drifter: alexlea: i thried that but it stuffs up the permissions
00:42  alexlea: LordDragon: i dont know...i havent read anything about it yet. i think using the computer's usb would be the way to go, but like using ot form the inside
00:42 +Branes: ae86-drifter: It is not possible to have a home folder with a space in it. If someone has decided to rename it via the Finder, that account has become irrepairably damaged, and needs to be deleted and a new account created.
00:42  alexlea: ae86-drifter: change the permissions
00:43  alexlea: ae86-drifter: you can do a mass change...that affects all subdirectories, etc
00:43  ae86-drifter: Branes: you are wrong, the home folder got created automatically upon login via AD, it DID NOT get renamed manually, i am aware that mac does not support spaces that is why i want to change it
00:43  alexlea: wth is AD
00:43  ae86-drifter: active directory
00:43 +Branes: Then the account needs to be changed on the ActiveDirectory server, not the iMac.
00:44  ae86-drifter: i can do that no problems but the home folder is local
00:44  ae86-drifter: when the account login in ad gets changed the new home folder gets created locally
00:45 +Branes: That is not possible, OSX will not permit a /Users/[shortname] with a space in it. It needs to be changed on the AD server.
00:45  ae86-drifter: Branes: it is possible, on over 50 iMacs i have had experience with this trust me
00:46  LordDragon: yeah, mine has a space in it too
00:46 +Branes: The full account name can have a space in it, but the shortname cannot.
00:46  alexlea: my shortname has unicode stars in it
00:46  ae86-drifter: Branes: your wrong mate sorry
00:46  alexlea: wait, nevermind
00:47  ae86-drifter: shortname AND longname BOTH HAVE SPACES
00:47  LordDragon: alexlea, show us your recent screenshot :)
00:47  LordDragon: my shortname is "lord dragon"
00:47 +Branes: I am not wrong. OSX will *not*, under any circumstances, allow the use of an account shortname with spaces in it. It is simply impossible.
00:48  ae86-drifter: Branes: well obviously you haven't experienced my problem then, please stop assuming you know everything because YOU DONT
00:49  ae86-drifter: Branes: I am telling you MAC OS X CREATED A HOME FOLDER WITH A SPACE
00:49  ae86-drifter: UNDERSTAND????
00:49 +Branes: I never said I did. I'm just stating that the way OSX handles account management, it is impossible fo rit to work with an account shortname with a space in it.
00:49  alexlea: my full name is ☆ aL3x ☆, but its retarded causewhat they call the full name is really just a short name...
00:49  alexlea: LordDragon: ok http://cl.ly/2H1W1r3z00110W0U1r3l
00:50 +Branes: Whatever is triggering the creation of the /users/shortname with a space in it needs to be rectified.
00:50  alexlea: ae86-drifter: hehe, even new people realise he is annoying
00:50  LordDragon: alexlea, ahh nice thanks. its so weird to see your macbook at 99% and with the "charging" icon :P
00:50  alexlea: LordDragon: why
00:51 +Branes: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1428 -- Each user in Mac OS X has a full "Name" and a "Short Name" as defined in the Users pane of System Preferences. The short name can contain up to 255 lowercase characters with no spaces (or up to 8 character in Mac OS X 10.1.5 or earlier).
00:51  ae86-drifter: Branes: well it is coming from the active directory server, the login has a space in it, after the mac os x machine is bound to AD, you login with that shortname(with a space) and it will create a home folder locally WITH A SPACE. this is obviously a bug with mac osx
00:51  LordDragon: alexlea, well usually it shows that your on battery
00:51  LordDragon: alexlea, what are you running that requires x11?
00:52  alexlea: LordDragon: wireshark
00:52  LordDragon: ahh
00:52  LordDragon: okie
00:52  ae86-drifter: Branes, i know
00:52 +Branes: You need to change the AD login then so that it does not have a space in it.
00:53 +Branes: The fault is with the account system on the AD server. That is what needs to be rectified -- there is nothing you can do about it from the ODSX side.
00:53  LordDragon: alexlea, you have an interesting font in limechat
00:53  ae86-drifter: Branes: yes, but then when i copy the old home folder contents to the new one after logging in again, the permissions get stuffed up, i can fix it if i chmod -R 777/Users/blah.blah but what is the correct way please?
00:53  alexlea: LordDragon: which one, sidebars or main screen
00:53  alexlea: LordDragon: i made this theme myself btw
00:53  LordDragon: alexlea, main screen
00:54  ae86-drifter: "repair permissions" does shit all
00:54  alexlea: LordDragon: you want the font?
00:54  LordDragon: alexlea, maybe I already have it. whats the name?
00:54  alexlea: LordDragon: its called "new"
00:54 +Branes: repair permissions only works on Apple-installed files. If you are certain that you have the shortname for the new account correct, you need to chown -R the files once they are moved. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1428
00:55  alexlea: LordDragon: wait, no i have override on, might just be monaco
00:56  alexlea: LordDragon: my sidebar stuff is the "new" font, but main winiw is just 13 point monaco
00:56  ae86-drifter: Branes: I am sorry - i am only 3 months new to mac os x... i will change the ownership of the files to the new user with the command you suggested thankyou
00:57  ae86-drifter: i think the snow leopard upgrade prevents you from logging in to an ad account with a space
00:57  ae86-drifter: maybe
00:58  barathron: Ever since that bug that deleted accounts in SL I am nervous messing with accounts too much :( 
00:58  barathron: the guest bug 
01:00 +Branes: It's a pity Apple still have the 'one computer, one user' approach after all these years. There's essentially no useful or reliable tools for working with an enterprise-wide multi-account system.
01:00 +Branes: And their AD support is appalling
01:00  LordDragon: alexlea, ah ok yeah i have that one
01:01 +Branes: And the stupid thing is, they *still* let end-users rename home folders.
01:11  LordDragon: i have the right to rename my home folder to whatever i want
01:16  alexlea: YES
01:19  LordDragon: hehe
01:24  ae86-drifter: Branes: AD, because OD sux
01:24  ae86-drifter: you get used to the certain issues Macs have with AD, jsut as bad as windows in my opinion..
01:25  torchie: AD?
01:25  torchie: oh active directory
01:26  ae86-drifter: we have over 100 macs using ad, about 50 accounts have spaces and most OS X functions work completely fine , 10.6.4 mostly, some 10.5.8 & 10.6.5
01:26  ae86-drifter: by accounts i mean shortname/ ad username
01:27 +Branes: whoever set up the AD accounts with spaces in it needs to get shot :)
01:29  b0o-yeah: huh?
01:29  b0o-yeah: spaces is okay
01:29  b0o-yeah: not perfect but I still use it
01:29  b0o-yeah: oh active directory never mind
01:30  Kasm279: BAH
01:30  Kasm279: FFFSYDGJSYUFUIOI
01:30  torchie: but
01:30  Kasm279: WHY DO YOU KEEP CRASHING OSX DP2 INSTALLER
01:30  torchie: home is where the heart is
01:30  torchie: if a man cannot name his home what can he do
01:31  b0o-yeah: 127.0.0.1
01:31  b0o-yeah: I still need to get one of those rugs
01:31  b0o-yeah: although there is the whole thing about it technically being 127.0.0.0 but oh well
01:31  b0o-yeah: Kasm279: why not run 10.6.5
01:31  torchie: kasm's jelly
01:32  Kasm279: b0o-yeah: you imply that SL is PPC-capable
01:32  b0o-yeah: I don't use PPC except for my 360
01:32  Kasm279: and you imply that I'm not doing this for fun and not for use as an actual OS
01:32  b0o-yeah: I am implying you are nuts
01:33  Kasm279: you imply i care about an xbox 360
01:33  Kasm279: you also imply i care what you think :P
01:33  b0o-yeah: nope
01:33  torchie: are you running osx on a 360
01:33  torchie: what a sight
01:33  b0o-yeah: lol hell no
01:33  Kasm279: lmao
01:33  LordDragon: <b0o-yeah> I am implying you are nuts  <-- agreed
01:33  Kasm279: i wanna try that now
01:33  Kasm279: lmao
01:33  b0o-yeah: LordDragon: :)
01:33  Kasm279: I'm nuts?
01:34  evilbug: yo, guys.
01:34  b0o-yeah: you know like up in a tree

02:32  ae86-drifter: lol
02:32  LordDragon: yeah, we have a long history of him trolling, and me calling him on it. then he went through a period where he stalked me to send abusive hateful comments, even using the freenode msg system. its was kind of hilarious. hes not blocked and ignored in every conceivable way :)
02:33  LordDragon: er not = now
02:47  bluez: Has anyone gotten their macbook to run linux without getting super hot?
02:50  bonhoffer: i am confused -- my mac is not connecting to my new router (asus RT-N12)
02:50  bonhoffer: one is -- the other has a "no pppoe configurations were found" at the top
02:50  bonhoffer: any options 
02:50  b0o-yeah: oh WTF I never even checked to see what Asus is offering these days ... oh well

02:55 @ChrisAM: should just be Configure IPv4: Using DHCP
02:56  bonhoffer: did that -- so odd -- i get an ip -- 169.254.193.9
02:56 @ChrisAM: that's the auto config ip
02:56  bonhoffer: my mbp get 192.168.1.4 which is what it should be since the router starts at 192.168.1.2
02:56  bonhoffer: and goes up
02:56  bonhoffer: my subnet mask is: 255.255.255.0
02:57  bonhoffer: i could try and manually assign the ip
02:57 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 128 seconds
02:57 @ChrisAM: is this via your airport or wired ethernet?
02:57  bonhoffer: airport
02:57  bonhoffer: i could hook in wired
02:57  bonhoffer: what should my configure ipv6 setting be?
02:57 @ChrisAM: nothing
02:57  bonhoffer: this all worked with my last n router
02:58  bonhoffer: so i set ipv6 to off
02:58 @ChrisAM: do you have a pppoe service listed in the left side with the rest of your connections?
02:58  bonhoffer: no airport, bluetooth, ethernet, firewire
02:58  bonhoffer: as in no, all i have is: airport, bluetooth, ethernet, firewire
02:58  b0o-yeah: bonhoffer: you might need to make sure the asus router is set to compatibility mode for say 802.11g
02:59 @ChrisAM: hmm... you're able to join the wireless network no problem?
02:59  bonhoffer: b0o-yeah: hmm . . . but i get an ssid authentication, and i get an ip -- it is just not in the netmask
02:59  bonhoffer: ChrisAM: and get an ip!

03:00  bonhoffer: b0o-yeah: i'll try a setting for that . . . but i don't think i could get a valid connection
03:00  bonhoffer: ChrisAM: that is what i think!
03:00  bonhoffer: thanks
03:00  bonhoffer: so dhcp is not working
03:00 @ChrisAM: that range is a link-local address.
03:00  bonhoffer: so it could be a g thing?
03:00  b0o-yeah: haha
03:00 @ChrisAM: perhaps
03:01 @ChrisAM: you could delete the airport connection from the left side and re-add it

09:06  alexlea: BobbyJr: i look at it like this, IF i was an omnipotent all knowing being, i wouldnt make flawed people,  nor would i make beings and not be able to predict they would be "bad"
09:06  alexlea: If i was a God, i wouldnt be petty and demand blood
09:07  BobbyJr: Why? Well I dont want to sound rude here, Im certainly not trying to be, but even the most open minded people have to admit that the Bible (as an example here) is chock full of things that either dont make much sense or are just plain rubbish.
09:07  jeremyw: alexlea: Why?  If we weren't flawed, we'd not have any reason to believe in God at all.
09:07  alexlea: More importantly, if i was God, and people who didnt follow me were eternally punished, i woudl greet the whole universe every morning and be like "hey peoples, its God here, and i loves you all!"
09:07  jeremyw: alexlea: Demanding blood is an old testament thing.  It was a ceremonial way to show your obedience and wasn't about blood and gore.
09:07 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 128 seconds
09:08  alexlea: jeremyw: sayng it's an old testmanet hting still doesnt make sense
09:08  alexlea: i mean, it's no easier to understand
09:08  Velociraptors: Slugs! HE created slugs! They can't hear. They can't speak. They can't operate machinery. Are we not in the hands of a lunatic? If I were creating the world I wouldn't mess about with butterflies and daffodils. I would have started with lasers, eight o'clock, Day One!
09:08  jeremyw: alexlea: God does do this.  God loves everyone, even those that don't believe or hate Him.  It's about cause and effect.
09:08  BobbyJr: Thats another thing.. obedience. Im sorry, Im not going to be obedient to anyone, at least not in the sense that I do pretty much whatever they say because they promise I might goto heaven.
09:09  alexlea: the obedience i have no  issue with
09:09  Kasm279|Away: BobbyJr: thats not what the obediance thing is about :P
09:09  jeremyw: Velociraptors: It's all about a very well orchestrated machine.  The systems in the universe don't just work.  Even slugs and such have their place, even science backs this up.
09:09  torchie: it'd still suck to be a slug though
09:09  alexlea: i believe in being a good person and doing good things...cause the obedience isnt about bowing down to him, like some think, its about honoring him by being good...
09:09  Velociraptors: (it's a quote from time bandits :)
09:09  Kasm279|Away: and alexlea
09:09  Kasm279|Away: [01:07:27] <alexlea> More importantly, if i was God, and people who didnt follow me were eternally punished, i woudl greet the whole universe every morning and be like "hey peoples, its God here, and i loves you all!"
09:10  Velociraptors: BobbyJr:  a friend of mine was in a relationship like that, once. 
09:10  Kasm279|Away: he basically does
09:10  Kasm279|Away: anyway
09:10  Kasm279|Away: night guys
09:10  jeremyw: BobbyJr: You are obedient.  You can't expect to break rules and not have consequences.  Running a red light, killing someone, not showing up at work...all ways you are obedient.
09:10  Kasm279|Away: night microraptor!
09:10  alexlea: jeremyw: science doe not back that up actually, the whle orecehstarted machine thing
09:10  jeremyw: alexlea: It really does.  We know how easy it is to disrupt the ecosystems from scientific research.
09:10  Kasm279|Away: alexlea: it doesn't?
09:11  jeremyw: People wonder why XXX insect even exists and upon reseraching it, we know how important it is for YYY ecosystem.
09:11  Kasm279|Away: also, i can totally see the point of ADC now
09:11 * Kasm279|Away stares at three cables running across the floor
09:11  alexlea: Kasm279|Away and jeremyw, well maybe some sicentists....but the view of most of what i have read (scientific sources) is that its statistics
09:11  Kasm279|Away: USB, VGA, and power
09:11  Kasm279|Away: statistics?
09:12  alexlea: Kasm279|Away: yeah, ok you have billions and billions of stars, 1 is bound to have a planet with life...i mean, there is way less life than life
09:12  Kasm279|Away: you imply there isn't anything else out there
09:13  BobbyJr: jeremyw: Agreed, everyone is in that sense. But its a little different, if I run a red light, I deal with very clear consequences. If I disobey God, then according to some book, Im not going to some place called heaven that nobody really knows anything about. Its not so clear, you get my point? Exaggerated I know, but you get the idea.
09:13  alexlea: ack
09:13  Velociraptors: While on the topic, folks - what do each of you consider *the* defining moment in your life, when you suddenly realised truths that made profound sense, that changed the course of your life afterwards - and what were those truths?
09:13  Kasm279|Away: Velociraptors: still haven't had such a moment
09:13  Kasm279|Away: :|
09:13  alexlea: no, i am not implying that...what i am saying is that most scientists just say that even if the odds of life are infetisimile, we were still bound to end up with life somewhere in the universe
09:14  Kasm279|Away: i see
09:14  Kasm279|Away: bah
09:14  Kasm279|Away: forget i said that
09:14  Kasm279|Away: one issue with that
09:14  Kasm279|Away: unless God made other planets
09:14  Kasm279|Away: life can only come from life
09:14  jeremyw: BobbyJr: Reading the Bible will tell you what Heaven is.  Of course if I didn't read about XXX place, I wouldn't know anything about it and discussions about it would be fruitless and with question.

09:15  alexlea: Velociraptors: when i ended up homeless 2 years ago, and realised i can do anything i want
09:15  BobbyJr: As I always say, the general rule of thumb is where there is one, there is many. The basic law of probability states that if there is 1 planet that sustains life, there are bound to be others.
09:15  Kasm279|Away: i said night, dammit >:|
09:16  jeremyw: I think it's very hard for anyone to believe in God without trying to.  I mean, to understand God you go to His word, His truth and that means reading the Bible.  Not reading the Bible, it's understandable why people don't know/understand God.
09:16  Velociraptors: alexlea:  similar here :) Very different situation, but similar result. 
09:16  jeremyw: That's like wanting to know how to understand iOS development and not being willing to read any resources about it.
09:16  alexlea: Velociraptors: before that happened, i was always so worried about bad htings happening, and being homeless pretty much sucks...and when i realised it didnt kill me, or even make me unhappy, i felt free
09:16  Velociraptors: I totally empathise. 
09:17  torchie: I suppose I don't have a single defining moment
09:18  torchie: 2010's been a hell of an opening year for me though
09:18  jeremyw: Wait until you're a parent.  You see the miracle of creation.  You research exactly how complex something as simple as a single cell is, all of the machines that make a single cell do business.  If you can believe it was all an accidental thing by chance, that defies physical law, easier than a grand orchestrator so be it.
09:18  alexlea: jeremyw: you cant assume taht all non believers didnt try at some point
09:18  jeremyw: I just can't believe it.
09:18  jeremyw: Even if I had no reason to believe in God, believing in the alternative is still harder to swallow than believing in God.
09:19  jeremyw: alexlea: I didn't say that.
09:19 +Branes: alexlea: what you think, you attract; your mindset attracts the reality you will experience. It's pretty much a golden rule :)
09:19  BobbyJr: Defining moment for me was accepting my sexuality and realising that what I'd been told through my life was completely wrong. Most eye opening moment of my whole life and changed me completely, for the better I might add.
09:19  alexlea: jeremyw: you said I think it's very hard for anyone to believe in God without trying to. .....i was responsinding to that
09:19  jeremyw: alexlea: Got you.
09:19  jeremyw: BobbyJr: Are you a homosexual?
09:19  Velociraptors: Mine was realising I didn't exist. What I thought was "Me" was a collection of crud I'd picked up and taken on board. Once I lost that (by choice) I was freed, too. 
09:20  lewellyn: jeremyw: why does that matter?
09:20  BobbyJr: jeremyw: haha, I am gay yes.
09:20  alexlea: Branes: that's a great quote/statement
09:20  jeremyw: lewellyn: Well, I'm trying not to read into his defining moment wrongly.
09:20  BobbyJr: It was a fair question.
09:21  alexlea: Velociraptors:  wait what, explain this more please
09:21  jeremyw: BobbyJr: Well, God loves you regardless.  Our society has created its own view of homosexuality and bad Christians out there have done their best to proliferate false claims about how God views it.
09:21 +Branes: 'Atheism Is Also A Religious Position,' Dorfl rumbled.
09:21 +Branes: 'No it's not!' said Constable Visit. 'Atheism is a denial of a god!'
09:21 +Branes: 'Therefore It Is A Religious Position,' said Dorfl. 'Indeed, A True Atheist Thinks Of The Gods Constantly, Albeit In Terms of Denial. Therefore, Atheism Is A Form Of Belief. If The Atheist Truly Did Not Believe, He Or She Would Not Bother To Deny.'
09:21  lewellyn: BobbyJr: perhaps. but realizing that, hey, i really AM straight and i can accept it, is also a bg thing.
09:21  lewellyn: big
09:22  alexlea: jeremyw: as for the "all by chance" thing, i am not sure you understand that completely...not syaing you ould believe it even if you did, but you are definately oversimplifying it
09:22  jeremyw: lewellyn: I meant no disrespect to BobbyJr.  I don't judge but based on his "defining moment", before following up I had to clarify waht I understood.
09:22  Velociraptors: alexlea:  almost everything that made up my identity back about two years ago was a collection of stuff that happened to me. I did a lot of "well this is sucky, but IT'S JUST HOW I AM" when it came to a whole load of beliefs, desires, thoughts, weaknesses
09:22 +Branes: Ergo, science is just as much a religion as Judaism or Christianity or CSFM.
09:22  torchie: Branes: TELL IT
09:22  jeremyw: alexlea: Of course I'm over simplifying it, how else could we talk about it?  ;)
09:22  torchie: i always felt science was really just another religion
09:23  Velociraptors: alexlea:  but they were all constructs I took on board from elsewhere, and carried with me. Seeing myself as nought but a spark of consciousness let me drop it all away. Made homeless, in a sense, by losing identity - something I once *feared* intensely. 
09:24  alexlea: Velociraptors: ok, i see what you are saying now...i was interpetting you way too literal at first
09:24  Velociraptors: :)
09:24  Velociraptors: nah, I'm not a ghost in the machine, eternally constrained to IRC channels :D. 
09:24 +Branes: You go to a physics tute, your lecturer reads from a big book describing how the world works. You go to a synagogue and the rabbi reads from a big book describing how the world works. I personally don't see any difference, no matter which one you choose (and choice is the important concept here, folks) it all boils down to faith, not proof.
09:24  BobbyJr: jeremyw: You are correct, society has created a very twisted view of both Christianity and indeed homosexuality and its bad Christians that have unfortunately helped to encourage that view. However without wanting to sound disrespectful, it would make little difference to me whether God did indeed love me or not.
09:25  alexlea: the only time i see religion as a problem, is like for example christian scientists that dont believe in antibiotics...or various wars, things like that
09:25  torchie: Branes: so in the end it's just like the days when all of a university's studies were focused on christianity
09:25  jeremyw: BobbyJr: That's the best thing, it's your choice.  God wants you to choose to believe in Him, love Him and be obedient.  It's your choice.
09:25 +Branes: You're looking it upside down, Jeremy. You can't say God is love. Love is God is far more appropriate.
09:25 +Berzerker: so guys
09:25 +Berzerker: what's going on
09:25  Velociraptors: Second part of that was seeing everything I took on board as myself was by choice, because it was what I saw events to be that I took as part of myself. 
09:26 +Berzerker: I see all of this non-mac chat going on
09:26  alexlea: Berzerker: religious discussion :)
09:26 +Branes: Welcome to Psychosocial Theosophy 101, Berzerker :)
09:26 +Berzerker: and you guys arguing about opinions
09:26 +Berzerker: which is dumb
09:26  jeremyw: Branes: I don't understand waht you're trying to say.
09:26  alexlea: Berzerker: we're having fun
09:26  Velociraptors: Willing happiness, peace, serenity out of nowhere, and just deciding not to be depressed, anxious and angsty has been the most awesome part. 
09:26  jeremyw: Berzerker: We're not arguing, we're sharing different perspectives.
09:26  jeremyw: Hopefully we're being open minded and learning, which I am.  I'm enjoying this a lot.
09:26 +Berzerker: [Wed 12/08/10 03:25:43 AM] <+Branes> You're looking it upside down, Jeremy. You can't say God is love. Love is God is far more appropriate.
09:26 +Berzerker: '
09:26 +Berzerker: looks like an argument :P
09:26  jeremyw: Much better than talking about Hackintosh.  haha
09:27  torchie: see what happens when you use a macintosh?
09:27 +Branes: jeremyw: Go read "Tomorrow's God".
09:27 +Branes: Neale Donal Walsch.
09:27  torchie: you stop end up discussing crazy things like "beliefs" and "society" or something
09:27  torchie: you end up*
09:27  BobbyJr: I must admit, Im quite enjoying this discussion, I certainly wouldnt say its an argument.
09:28  jeremyw: Branes: Englighten me and give me an quick synopsis of what I'd get by doing this?  Not arguing with you, just hoping to talk now instead of in a few weeks when I finish the book.
09:28  jeremyw: ;)
09:28  jeremyw: BobbyJr: Agreed.
09:28  torchie: see
09:28  torchie: we only "argue" when we start talking about computers
09:29  jeremyw: I love hearing other people's opinions.  Not only is it a chance for me to learn but it's sometimes even a way for me to possibly dissolve someone's view that was based on false truths or bad examples.
09:29  alexlea: Velociraptors: i have done the same as what you said, willing happiness, etc...for me it happens because i no longer expect things to be a certain way, i just kinda accept what is happening...in general anyway...on a small scale, i expect things, like trips to teh store, things like that
09:30  Velociraptors: alexlea:  totally! 
09:30  torchie: all you need is prisencolenensinainciusol
09:30 +Branes: jeremyw: Redefining the concept of God as perceived by mainstream Judaistic religions by looking at the original precepts of who and what God *is*. If God is omnopotent and omnipresent, then God is part of us, and we are part of God -- All is One. The concept of a separate, all-powerful Being is therefore a null set, and any system of faith which relies on that concept is lying.
09:30  Velociraptors: torchie:  :D
09:31  jeremyw: Branes: Agreed.
09:31  torchie: still trying to spell it right
09:31  torchie: prisencolinensinainciusol!
09:31  torchie: ALLRIGHT
09:31  Velociraptors: Branes:  When I had my little sudden-enlightenment (fixed all my depresso/anxiety in seconds) that became the clearest thing. 
09:31 * Branes knows this :)
09:32  jeremyw: Branes: If I've said anything that was against what you said, it was probably bad wording on my part.
09:32  richardcavell: Gee this channel has gone to a different topic since I last looked at it
09:32  alexlea: richardcavell: hackintosh is the devil, so accept christ and be saved....still the same topic...lol
09:33  jeremyw: haha
09:33 +Branes: It wasn't so much againsy, more a clarification of what (I think) you were trying to impart to Bobby.
09:33 +Branes: *against
09:33  Velociraptors: Curious this convo comes up now - today's my one-year anniversary of that little 'enlightenment'. I changed the birthday I celebrate to today, and wrote a little piece on what it did for me in a practical sense - http://nanoraptor.tumblr.com/post/2140216966 
09:33  Velociraptors: It's long, kinda rambling, but I found it a fun trip :)

09:35  Velociraptors: Branes:  heaven & hell
09:35  jeremyw: Well guys, I'm tired.  Heading to bed.  Peace out homies.
09:35 +Branes: Dream well.
09:35  alexlea: what i have never understood is satanists...i mean if you believe in satan, why would you pick satan over god....
09:37  alexlea: jeremyw: now we will have no counterpoint to our point
09:37  alexlea: night
09:37 +Branes: Satanists are a dichotomy -- their perceived universe is themselves and only themselves, yet to further their desire for more power with less effort they turn to a force/system outside of their perceived universe.
09:37 +Branes: Most puzzling.
09:37  BobbyJr: alexlea: Some people are just plain crazy lol, those are the satanists.
09:37  Velociraptors: alexlea:  as a symbol of freedom, personal choice, personal responsibility - still being in a judeochristian religious framework, but rejecting perceived obedience, adherence to dogma, and giving up responsibility
09:38 +Branes: "People ask me what is the most powerful force in the universe; is it love or hate, or good or evil? I say it's choice -- before you can become a loving person you have to choose to become a loving person." -- Dr Caroline Myss 
09:38  Velociraptors: alexlea:  least, that's how the satanists I know appear to act. (admittedly only 3 folk!)
09:38  alexlea: Velociraptors: what kind are they? cause theres ones who literally bellieve in satan, and then there are anton lavay hedonists types
09:39  Velociraptors: they're the latter afaik
09:41  alexlea: the anton lavey hedonists types aren't as insane imo, as someone who really believes the devil exists, believes he is bad, and yet still chooses him

10:06  alexlea: i choose to let irc cure my problem..language again!
10:07  Velociraptors: that's it :)
10:10  alexlea: k, i read all of the first link and most of the of the "why i am happy"....i have a friend that i wish this would happen to, this enlightenment. His thing is he blames EVERYONE else for his uhappiness
10:10  alexlea: he wants to be happy, but until he realises he controls it, it will never happen...and he is convinced his family is on some vendetta against him to purposly make him unhappy
10:11  alexlea: my mom was the same way.... at age 48 still complaining her parents got her brother a car and not her
10:12  alexlea: that brother being the uncle that killed himself, and he was deaf... ie. she didnt see how much better she had it
10:12  Velociraptors: same with a few friends here. It's not so easy finding a place to start wedging those ideas into someone else, so they can lever-up some already in-built processes. 
10:13  johngoh: cool
10:13  Velociraptors: and all the time knowing they're still doing the best they know how!
10:13  alexlea: with my friend, i have begin to think it might be more damagin for him to acknowledge he is resposnsible
10:14  alexlea: i think he is happier thinking its not him
10:14  alexlea: i gave up trying to tell him it was him, because he viewd it as though i was saying it's his "fault" rather than his "decision"...i was hoping to help him free imself, he saw it as being blamed
10:15  Velociraptors: I empathise with that! (was only... 18 months ago I was still much the same)
10:16  Velociraptors: and I didn't see it until I started making happiness for myself, rather than seeing my depression was made by myself. It all kinda cascaded that way, by being drawn to positive, rather than blaming myself for the negative
10:18 * Velociraptors -> outside. Heavy, humid but only just warm air. Also, last of the sunset... needs a little soaking up :)
10:20  alexlea: because my mom was so miserable, and blaming of people, me being one of those people she blames, i realised early not to blame others
10:21  alexlea: my mom had a severe anxiety disorder or something and was kinda crazy...but her crazyness made me do the opposite, so all in all her being crazy was a positive infuence on my life
10:42  npoektop: hi! i'm running 10.6.3. Why doesn't "$ defaults write com.apple.mail RSSPollTime 1" work for me? It should check rss once a minute, but if i force check rss manually, it may give me entries twenty minutes age.

10:55  alexlea: i would try "sudo defaults write com.apple.mail RSSPollTime 1"

12:34  DarkStar1: Anyone know the intel processor model in the latest 13" mbp?
12:35 +Branes: Core 2 Duo
12:36 +Tomis: pretty easy to find out as well DarkStar1: http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs-13inch.html
12:37 +Branes: thankfully its one of the last Intel chips we'll see in Macs.
12:37 +Tomis: so you keep hoping Branes 
12:38 +Branes: I've all but had Steve ring up and ask me who's been blabbing :) It's not a hope, it's accurate foreknowledge :)
12:38  DarkStar1: I need to know the processor class..
12:38  DarkStar1: SO I can check whether it has the ability to support Virtualisation
12:38 +Tomis: you can run a VM on it, yes
12:39  DarkStar1: ]or rather to check it against other 2.4GHz intel CPUs
12:39  Velociraptors: DarkStar1:  down the bottom of http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/index-macbookpro.html has the model numbers. 
12:39 +Tomis: probably want to up the ram though
12:39 +Branes: Even the shitty Air's C2D has a VT switch.
12:39  DarkStar1: Tomis: YEs you can run a VM on it. but for instance it wont support 64 bit OS as guest on my mbp
12:39  DarkStar1: Velociraptors: Thanks man... will check now
12:40 +Tomis: interesting
12:41 +Tomis: that's probably more to do with the 32bit kernel and VM kernel extension i'd think
12:41  Velociraptors: 32 bit kernel here is happy with a 64 bit guest OS
12:42  Velociraptors: not that I know anything more when it comes to why it *wouldn't* elsewhere!
12:42 +Tomis: but what VM are you guys using
12:43 +Tomis: maybe it's just a limitation in the VM he has, and not in yours
12:43  Velociraptors: could be
12:43  Velociraptors: vmware here
12:43 +Tomis: what CPU does your MBP have DarkStar1 
13:00  DarkStar1: Tomis: 2.4 GHz C2D

13:17  clocKwize: hi guys, I'm trying to load Visor (terminal SIMBL plugin), i've done everything i did last time i installed it yet it just doesn't load in to the console
13:17  clocKwize: anyone know of a way I can diagnose SIMBL loading problems?
13:18  clocKwize: can't find a log anywhere or aynthing
13:19  ayaz: clocKwize: Have you looked at the Console.app application for any mention in the logs of why it may not be loading?
13:20  clocKwize: aha, good idea...forgot about that console app :)
13:20  clocKwize: found the error right away
13:20  clocKwize: 08/12/2010 12:13:25	Terminal[1322]	Error loading /Users/mikeyb/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/Visor.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Visor:  dlopen(/Users/mikeyb/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/Visor.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Visor, 265): no suitable image found.  Did find:
13:20  clocKwize: 	/Users/mikeyb/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/Visor.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Visor: no matching architecture in universal wrapper
13:21  clocKwize: what architecture should it be looking for? i386 or x86_64 right?
13:23  ayaz: clocKwize: Are you on Snow Leopard?
13:23  clocKwize: I am
13:24  clocKwize: I had it working on this laptop like 2 days ago.. i just reinstalled osx :/
13:27  ayaz: clocKwize: That's weird.  Assuming you've the latest SIMBL and Visor, they should both work out of the box.
13:27  clocKwize: yep :/
13:27  clocKwize: how do i found out what arch it's trying to use?
13:36  ayaz: clocKwize: I am not sure really. :) But if you run the `file` command against the binary, you can at least find out which different architectures that binary is compiled against.  
13:37  clocKwize: ok, thanks
13:37  clocKwize: hmm, it's only got ppc7400 and i386
13:37  clocKwize: no 64
13:37  ayaz: clocKwize: There's also the `arch` command to force a particular architecture for a binary, but I am not sure how to make it work with SIMBL.
13:37  ayaz: Yea, that could be the problem.
13:39  clocKwize: ahh, i was looking at an old site for visor
13:39  clocKwize: that didn't have the latest version
13:39  clocKwize: :/
13:39  clocKwize: even though it said works for snow leopard
13:41  ayaz: :)
13:42  torchie: :D
13:44  clocKwize: SIMBL is cool
13:44  clocKwize: might use it for a app/hack i wrote
13:45  clocKwize: atm, i have a loader which sets the environmental variable of which dylib's to load, runs the app then sets it back to nothing :p
13:45  ayaz: clocKwize: Yes. I use it to run the MouseTerm plugin.
13:46  clocKwize: mouseterm looks interesting.. weird using a mouse in the terminal ;p
13:48  ayaz: clocKwize: Yea :) Vim has great support for mouse, in that, for example, you can switch between tabs with a mouse, etc. But apparenlty, Terminal.app eats away all the mouse gestures and doesn't let them pass through to the applications running inside it.
13:48  clocKwize: strange :/
13:50  ayaz: clocKwize: Yea, my biggest pet peeve with Terminal, and which led me to find MouseTerm, was how inside a Vim screen, if I tried to scroll using the mouse, it would just scroll through the scrollback for the Terminal and not Vim.
13:51  clocKwize: what if you wanted to scroll the terminal instead?
13:53  ayaz: clocKwize: I'd either: a) suspend the Vim session and scroll, or use the scrollbar on the Terminal to scroll.
13:54  clocKwize: ah ok

16:56  pilgo: My CPU has started to be sporadic this morning. It's usage on the graph isn't at all reflected by Activity Monitor
16:57  pilgo: The fans are blowing hard too
16:57  pilgo: Could it be a virus hiding itself from activity monitor?
17:00  LzrdKing: unlikely
17:19  Angostura: Oops, the virus kicked him
17:19  Angostura: Actually I had one of my fans suddenly ramp up to max out of the blue yesterday
17:19  Angostura: most odd
17:20  osxdude: heh
17:20  osxdude: that happened to this Mac Pro I'm sitting at...
17:20  osxdude: it was running Cyberduck and all of a sudden, while talking about Ferraris no less, the Mac Pro turned into a noise machine
17:21  osxdude: as if a Ferrari was passing by
17:21  qwebirc11921: Hi, could anyone tell me the appropriate path, where to store users settings for a specific application (like it's stored at /home/USERNAME/.myapplication under linux)
17:22  osxdude: even though we are in a room with no windows
17:22  osxdude: qwebirc11921: Usually it's ~/Library/Preferences
17:22  qwebirc11921: then like /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/MyApplication/ ?
17:22  osxdude: Some apps store some special data in the same ~/Library folder or ~/Library/Application\ Support
17:23  osxdude: actually it's a special file name
17:23  osxdude: like com.apple.iChat.plist
17:23  osxdude: I must go
17:24  torchie: maybe it's cyberduck
17:24  torchie: opening it makes my computer poop itself

18:52  crilly: This RAM upgrade is making a huge difference
18:53 +Tomis: from what to what crilly 
18:53  crilly: Tomis: 2GB to 8GB.
18:53 +Tomis: oh wow, i bet
18:54  crilly: Now all I need is an SSD drive
18:54  crilly: and it'll be like going from a car to the Starship Enterprise
18:54 +Tomis: yea i think i'll probably a year or so and get a hybrid
18:54 +Tomis: SSD will still be too expensive, but hrybrid will be more mature by then
18:56  crilly: Tomis: I'm going to wait until next year before getting an ssd
18:57 +Tomis: it'll be time for a new machine before SSD are worth the cost for me
18:58  crilly: I'm pretty happy with my MBP 13" to be honest. I think an SSD with 8GB of RAM and a 2.23 C2D is going to be enough for my needs. All I have to do is not go beyond CS5, which is the heaviest suite of software I use, and I'll be OK.
18:58 +Tomis: i up'd this machine from 320GB 5400rpm to 500GB 7200rpm imediately, so i'm already a little spoiled, not knowing what the performance diferent fels like between those two
18:59  crilly: Mine still has a 5400RPM in it. I was thinking of going 7200RPM, but only if I know I'll get a serious performance boost.

19:42  Necrosan: I think they all had magsafe
19:42  MrUnagi: they havent always had magsafe
19:42  MrUnagi: er
19:42  MrUnagi: ok
19:42  MrUnagi: sorry
19:42  MrUnagi: not necessarily macbook
19:43  Necrosan: ibook
19:43  MrUnagi: ibook
19:43  MrUnagi: yea sorry
19:43  Necrosan: All ibooks had push pin style
19:43  Necrosan: and PBG4's
19:43  Necrosan: SO figure up to 05?
19:43  MrUnagi: so if i find an ibook charger it would probably charge all of the ibook models
19:44  Necrosan: more than likely, but check everymac.com to verify
19:44  Necrosan: or another site similar to that
19:44  MrUnagi: cool thanks
19:44  MrUnagi: i entered in the game july 2009, im new lol
19:45  Necrosan: Ahh
19:45  MrUnagi: :D
19:45  Necrosan: I started on a sawtooth G4 years ago
19:45  MrUnagi: im scared of ppc too
19:45  Necrosan: Like 2003 or something
19:46  MrUnagi: like, i am tempted to buy old powerbooks but, im scared of them lol
19:46  MrUnagi: like, ill get one, and hulu will chug
19:46  MrUnagi: or worse, netflix
19:46  Necrosan: dont even bother man
19:46  Necrosan: You can get macbooks for like 250-400
19:46  Necrosan: on craigslist
19:46  Necrosan: The best part is buy the cracked up ones
19:46  Necrosan: Apple will replace case plastics for free, like new laptop for $250 ;)
19:46  Necrosan: No warranty needed
19:47  Necrosan: My last one I scored was $290
19:47  MrUnagi: why would they do that?
19:47  Necrosan: But I've scored a couple for cheaper
19:47  Necrosan: It's a known defect, MrUnagi
19:47  Necrosan: Hence the nickname Apple CrackBook
19:47  Necrosan: macbook airs, too
19:47  MrUnagi: never heard that lol
19:48  Necrosan: SOmetimes those will be on CL for like $150 cause of their shitty design
19:48  MrUnagi: so no specific crack pattern size or location?
19:48  Necrosan: that breaks the motherboard
19:48  Necrosan: MrUnagi: all parts of the case are covered
19:48  Necrosan: It can't be intentional damage
19:48  Necrosan: Stress cracks only
19:48  Necrosan: They USED to just replace the whole screen portion. They might just change the casing on it now
19:49  MrUnagi: apparently people in savannah are crooks
19:49  MrUnagi: cheapest is 450
19:51  Necrosan: you gotta lowball man
19:51  Necrosan: Don't be afraid to call people up like that offering them $275
19:51  MrUnagi: lol they usually cuss me out when i do that
19:51  Necrosan: If you get it for under $400 id consider it.. depending on condition
19:51  Necrosan: who cares? its craigslist people
19:51  MrUnagi: ol
19:51  MrUnagi: lol
19:51  Necrosan: they're nearly as bad as walmart folks
19:51  MrUnagi: im like dude, im not going to pay half of what you paid for it over a year ago
19:52  Necrosan: yeah
19:52  Necrosan: pretty much
19:52  Necrosan: People think apple stuff should resell higher
19:52  MrUnagi: heh
19:52  Necrosan: When in reality the failure rate of apple stuff is nearly just as much as most PC OEM
19:52  MrUnagi: i mean granted old apples make great servers
19:52  Necrosan: yeah
19:52  Necrosan: Wish I wouldn't have sold my old G4 =P
19:53  MrUnagi: i need to figure out how to make a redundant web server
19:53  Necrosan: my advice - put a *bsd on it
19:53  MrUnagi: but i dont know how i would set that up
19:53  MrUnagi: only way i can figure that it can be done is in the router
19:53  MrUnagi: or have a server that also routes
19:53  Necrosan: yeah, easier to just use a router
19:54  MrUnagi: and have that server redirect to a second server in case the first one doesnt respond
19:54  Necrosan: or if you have a NICE server 2 nics and a switch
19:54  Necrosan: that makes no sense
19:54  Necrosan: but OK
19:54  Necrosan: ;)
19:54  MrUnagi: how not?
19:54  MrUnagi: oh
19:54  MrUnagi: lol
19:54  MrUnagi: theres gotta be a no cost way to create redundancy
19:55  Necrosan: lol, your computer becomes the router in this scenario
19:55  Necrosan: s/computer/server/
19:55  MrUnagi: yea.....which i would like to avoid 2 servers on at all times
19:56  MrUnagi: i dont think that is possible though
19:56  MrUnagi: to do this anyway
19:56  Necrosan: yes it is
19:56  Necrosan: very easily
19:56  MrUnagi: do tell lol
19:57  Necrosan: I just did tell you how
19:57  Necrosan: Put 2 nics in your comp
19:57  MrUnagi: its a mac mini
19:57  MrUnagi: =(
19:57 * MrUnagi ducks
19:57  Necrosan: heh
19:57  MrUnagi: lol
19:57  Necrosan: If it doesn't have dual nics stock
19:57  Necrosan: you SOL
19:57  Necrosan: OR -
19:57  Necrosan: YOu might be able to find a USB nic, but fuck that man
19:57  Necrosan: Seriously
19:57  MrUnagi: but even with dual nics that only protects against nic failure
19:57  Necrosan: Have you _EVER_ had a nic fail?
19:58  Necrosan: honestly?
19:58  Necrosan: (i havent)
19:58  Necrosan: Crappy dlink/linksys routers? sure.
19:58  MrUnagi: you gotta remember this isnt a professional job
19:58  MrUnagi: just something for me to do at home
19:58  Necrosan: sure, I'm suggesting possible at home solutions =P
19:58  MrUnagi: i work in the army as a network operator....they dont let me do anything fun
19:58  MrUnagi: hopefully when i get out i can get a real job
19:59  MrUnagi: ok so run me through it again
19:59  MrUnagi: what i was thinking is two web servers, one main, and one sleeping
19:59  Necrosan: there's no point man
19:59  Necrosan: lol
19:59  MrUnagi: why not lol
19:59  Necrosan: Why waste the power?
20:00  Necrosan: That one box is more than enough to handle a basic webserver
20:00  MrUnagi: well thats why i was saying server two would sleep
20:00  Necrosan: fileserver, media server
20:00  MrUnagi: oh yes i am aware
20:00  Necrosan: And host a minecraft server in addition
20:00  MrUnagi: it is my everyserver
20:00  MrUnagi: lol
20:00  MrUnagi: even serves boxee for my tv
20:00  MrUnagi: i love that box
20:00  Necrosan: ;)
20:00  Necrosan: what is your MOS?
20:00  MrUnagi: 25N
20:00  MrUnagi: which use to be 25F
20:01  Necrosan: Ahh.. I went in as 31B a few years ago
20:01  Necrosan: 3 or 4?
20:01  MrUnagi: 4
20:01  MrUnagi: 1.5 lef
20:01  MrUnagi: left
20:01  Necrosan: you like it?
20:01  MrUnagi: no
20:01  Necrosan: heh
20:01  Necrosan: I didn't like the pay..
20:01  MrUnagi: people keep telling me its the duty station
20:01  MrUnagi: pay is ok i guess
20:01  Necrosan: Where are oyu stationed?
20:01  MrUnagi: fort stewart
20:01  Necrosan: training base
20:02  Necrosan: eh?
20:02  MrUnagi: the pay is ok if you dont figure in what you know and/or can do
20:02  Necrosan: lol
20:02  Necrosan: Yeah man, I wasn't OK with that =P
20:02  MrUnagi: meaning....before i actually did my job the pay was great.....now that i can do more than what they let me
20:02  MrUnagi: im like wtf
20:02  MrUnagi: i can get out and make more than you 1st sgt
20:02  Necrosan: Yeah... it's just to cover their asses
20:02  Necrosan: and "tradition" - 2.5 year'ers get nothing cool =P

20:02  MrUnagi: true
20:03  MrUnagi: it gets annoying really

20:03  Necrosan: Ahhh
20:03  Necrosan: You lucky
20:03  Necrosan: They don't let that happen to a lot of folks
20:03  MrUnagi: eh i guess, i could have used the money lol
20:04  Necrosan: I know what you mean
20:04  MrUnagi: especially since my wife is a lazy little punk lol
20:04  Necrosan: haha nice

22:00  ErrantEgo: so IDK
22:00  ErrantEgo: i was told its more or less like a CD
22:00  ErrantEgo: it can only write to that area so much
22:00  ErrantEgo: then that sector will end up dead
22:01  ErrantEgo: so for as much as they cost, and the size of the drive, its not really worth it
22:01  ErrantEgo: anyone with an argument?
22:02  ahihi: it's not like hard drives last forever either
22:03  ahihi: but I guess SSD lifetimes are still shorter

22:03  alexbobP: ErrantEgo: *theoretically* yes, SSD memory will wear out, but I seriously doubt it'll be an issue in practice
22:04  alexbobP: ErrantEgo: unless you just write a program to write and over-write your entire drive, and leave it running for weeks
22:04  ErrantEgo: well, with their current price, i dont think its worth spending the money
22:04  alexbobP: I have an SSD in my mac and I like it a lot
22:04  ErrantEgo: the price to hard drive space ratio is way off
22:04  alexbobP: well yeah, it depends on how much space you need
22:04  alexbobP: I could have gotten a much bigger hard drive if I bought a hard drive instead of an ssd
22:04  ErrantEgo: reminds me of way back in teh day
22:04  alexbobP: but I didn't really need that much space for my laptop[
