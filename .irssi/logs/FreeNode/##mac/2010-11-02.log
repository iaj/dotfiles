00:44  conradev: Quick question: Is it possible to show system files, such as /usr/, /private/, etc  -but- hide '.Somename' files/folders?
00:47  jeffmr: probably possible to hide some files but it would require some unix magic
00:48  jeffmr: you mean in the finder?
00:48  conradev: jeffmr: yeah, finder
00:50  jeffmr: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20010328120852495
00:57  jeffmr: http://creativebits.org/mac_os_x/hide_files_and_folders_mac_os_x_finder
00:57  jeffmr: you could probably come up with a script that hid certain files
00:57  conradev: jeffmr: Exactly
00:58  jeffmr: your welcome
00:59  conradev: jeffmr: Thanks. Im going to show everything (like i had before) and recursively hide .* files using some cron
01:00  jeffmr: would .* files show up if all files were unhidden?
01:00  jeffmr: or are those only hidden at the terminal by default
01:01  conradev: jeffmr: Yeah, it makes my computer look incredibly cluttered
01:01  jeffmr: there may be a way to do it with onyx or some utility
01:07  jeffmr: if you wrote the script you could include the the list from the first link and for ch flags hidden find a way to have it hide things through directories
01:07  jeffmr: I'm not sure what that would be
01:07  Alexookah: anyone using external USB drive and user account sharing on time capsule? i dwitch from timecapsule password to user account and i dont see any of my data like on timecapsule password...
01:07  jeffmr: then add the script to cron
01:08  jeffmr: someone in a unix channel might be able to help you with the command
01:09  jeffmr: even if you did something like find .* | chflags hidden something
01:09  conradev: jeffmr: I got it easy peasy http://pastie.org/private/2en2efljsu2qf1wgavxt0q
01:10  jeffmr: good
01:10  jeffmr: pretty much what I said
01:10  conradev: yep
01:28  Kasm279: wtf
01:28  Kasm279: iTunes isn't really shuffling my music
01:28  Kasm279: it just keeps playing it in the same random order o_o
01:54  Tomis: it should reshuffle at the end of the playlist afaik Kasm279 
01:55  Kasm279: Tomis: well it certainbly didn't play 3.7 days of music in one hour :\

02:07  Branes: Don't ask to ask, just ask.
02:07  MultiFinder: He's asked several already! Unless you were talking about questions with substance, in which case I'm assuming he has some.
02:07  MultiFinder: motown0067: Out with it mate.
02:08  motown0067: yes, have you have had any luck with windows on a AD domain? I have joined the use but I'm not able to give the user admin rights over her computer.
02:09  motown0067: sorry mac on a AD Domain
02:10  motown0067: anyone?
02:14  motown0067: OK, I'm binding a mac to an Active Directory Domain and I have been unable to give the user admin rights over her mac.

02:33  richardcavell: it's cool
02:34  richardcavell: takes a lot of CPU though

02:44  richardcavell: picasso: yes it is
02:44  Tomis: try just hitting the power button?
02:44  picasso: just hold down power to shut it off?
02:44  picasso: just pressing it (once) doesnt do it
02:44  Tomis: if that doesn't work, then hold it down for a force shutdown

07:46  iaintel: hi guys
07:47  iaintel: I got a non-mac keyboard and wanna get a verbose boot, what shortcuts should I use?
07:48  Tomis: command-v
07:48  aL3x: do you want it all the time?
07:48  Tomis: so... try windows key - v
07:48  aL3x: if so, you can type something in the terminal, if not window+v
07:49  iaintel: well, it doesn't boot at all, that's why
07:50  aL3x: no one asked you why...
07:51  aL3x: what do you mean doesnt boot? do you mean it doesnt come on, or what
07:53  KyleXY: Do you mean Open Firmware fails to load?
07:53  KyleXY: Do you see a white screen
07:53  Tomis: usually when a users says "it doesn't work at all" what they mean is "it's not doing what i want/expect it to"
07:53  KyleXY: Or the apple logo?
07:55  iaintel: It just doesn't boot, nor recognizes my dell keyboard now
07:56  iaintel: the keyboard works perfectly with windows
07:56  KyleXY: That isn't enough info
07:56  KyleXY: Do you see nything on the screen
07:56  iaintel: I see the apple and hear the startup tone
07:56  Tomis: try holding shift for safe boot iaintel 
07:56  KyleXY: Tomis: Damn you beat me to it
07:56  Tomis: or alt/option for the boot manager
07:56  iaintel: well, the keyboard is not recognized at all ...
07:56  iaintel: let me try another keyboard
07:56  Tomis: how do you know the keyboard isn't recognized
07:57  KyleXY: iaintel: Doubt that is the case, heh.
07:57  KyleXY: Tomis: Exactly.
07:57  Tomis: using a usb mac keyboard would be prefered though
07:57  iaintel: because it lights up when connected to windows, but not in mac
07:57  iaintel: Tomis, I know, but I don't have one atm
07:57  KyleXY: That doesn''t mean it isn't recognized
07:57  KyleXY: No power?
07:57  Tomis: hmm
07:57  Tomis: that tells me the usb port isn't providing power
07:57  KyleXY: Tomis: Seems the mac isn't allocating power to the usb port
07:57  KyleXY: yeah
07:58  KyleXY: Try another port
07:58  Tomis: which means it's worse than the keyboard not being "recognized"
07:58  KyleXY: iaintel: What type of mac?
07:59  iaintel: Tomis, no it does
07:59  iaintel: KyleXY, imac g5
07:59  Tomis: mmm
07:59  KyleXY: Well, this is something,
07:59  Tomis: when did this start happening?
07:59  Tomis: have you tried booting from the system DVD
07:59  iaintel: electricity went off
07:59  KyleXY: So something blew maybe?
07:59  Tomis: is the machine connected to a surge protector?
08:00  iaintel: yeah, maybe it was updating or something idk
08:00  Tomis: is anything else in the house acting wonky?
08:00  iaintel: no
08:00  iaintel: no
08:00  KyleXY: Or something was being changed with system files while the power was gone
08:00  KyleXY: was cut*
08:00  iaintel: maybe a cron job idk
08:00  KyleXY: Which might explain why the system won't boot
08:00  KyleXY: But not the usb problem
08:00  KyleXY: heh
08:00  Tomis: hold option/alt key to get it to boot int othe boot selector iaintel 
08:00  iaintel: :)
08:01  KyleXY: Tomis: His keyboard is failing or so he says.
08:01  iaintel: I have to get the keyboard to work first lol
08:01  iaintel: I'll connect another dell kb
08:01  Tomis: well you don't have many options
08:01  Tomis: try antoher port on it
08:01  Tomis: any usb keyboard should work
08:02  KyleXY: This may be irrelevant but: what OS is the g5 running.
08:02  iaintel: I really have no idea KyleXY 
08:02  iaintel: but second keyboard doesn't work either on any port
08:02  KyleXY: Really..?
08:02  KyleXY: Ok
08:02  KyleXY: So a port issue
08:03  iaintel: no
08:03  iaintel: it provides power
08:03  iaintel: as I have a usb flashlight and it works on all ports
08:03  Tomis: what did you try to do with the keyboard to determine it "doesn't work"
08:03  KyleXY: Plug the keyboard in
08:03  KyleXY: hold alt
08:03  KyleXY: then power on computer
08:03  KyleXY: Tomis: That is what I am wondering.
08:04  iaintel: ok
08:04  aL3x: my usb ports dies once, BUT my camera was able to charge form them....nothong fied it except an archive/install
08:04  aL3x: dies=died
08:04  aL3x: fied=fixed
08:04  KyleXY: I have never had this issue
08:04  KyleXY: heh
08:04  Tomis: that doesn't make sense aL3x 
08:04  iaintel: hey hey
08:04  iaintel: something new here
08:04  aL3x: yeah, it made no sense to me either
08:05  aL3x: my mouse, printer, etc...none would work
08:05  Tomis: however, if a port is doing something out of spec power wise, the system will shut it down as a failsafe, until reboot
08:05  KyleXY: iaintel: Did it show you a boot option type window?
08:05  aL3x: but my camera would charge...it wouldnt show up and let me gets the pics tho
08:05  aL3x: but it would charge the cam
08:05  KyleXY: iaintel: Did it show you a boot option type window?
08:05  KyleXY: s/window/display/
08:06  aL3x: i never figured out what was up...i think it had something to do with me insta;;ing some crazy usb software so i could jailbreak my ipoad at the time
08:06  iaintel: ver left there's a "refresh" button, middle hdd icon which says "macintosh hd" and right an arrow
08:06  iaintel: very*
08:06  KyleXY: iaintel: So your keyboard does work
08:06  Tomis: yea, that's the boot manager iaintel 
08:06  Tomis: yup
08:06  Tomis: at this point, i'd recommend pooping in the system DVD
08:06  KyleXY: yep
08:07  iaintel: so what do those options do?
08:07  KyleXY: Tomis: I wonder if Single User mode will work though?
08:07  Tomis: try booting from the mac os x installer
08:07  Tomis: it's the boot manager iaintel 
08:07  Tomis: it lets you select a boot disk
08:07  KyleXY: iaintel: Lets you boot form different partitions / dvds / firewires / hdd's etc.
08:07  iaintel: oh I see
08:07  KyleXY: from*
08:08  KyleXY: Tomis: Do you think Single User mode might work?
08:08  iaintel: would safe mood would then?
08:08  Tomis: safe mode just boots without some low-level 3rd party software
08:08  iaintel: maybe they're the problem
08:08  KyleXY: From what you are saying, I doubt it
08:08  Tomis: do you have your system DVD?
08:08  KyleXY: if this happened during some power outage.
08:08  Tomis: because that's the step i'd take right now
08:09  Tomis: try to repair the disk, and repair disk permisions
08:09  Tomis: at the least you may end up just needing to do an archive & instal, which reinstals the OS and leaves user accounts intact
08:09  KyleXY: What was that nifty tool
08:09  KyleXY: Errr.

11:38  panosru: Hello, I have a debian virtual machine in my OSX and I had set /etc/exports in OSX in order to use nfs to mount a path from OSX into my debian virtual machine, it was working fine but now if I run mount I will get permission denied :(
12:00  DoFoT9: panosru: run a disk repair?
12:01  panosru: DoFoT9: you think? hmm I might try but I'm not sure its related to it but I'm trying something now if it will not work I will try disk repair but the partition works good :S
12:02  DoFoT9: panosru: definetely odd! is there anything from memory that you had changed?
12:02  DoFoT9: (your memory, not the computers) :P
12:02  panosru: yeah :P
12:02  panosru: no I haven't changed anything really
12:03  DoFoT9: hmm
12:03  panosru: but either way I resetup the exports now like I did before and I get the same error
12:03  DoFoT9: i assume that youd checked the permissions on the folder..
12:03  DoFoT9: probably through Get Info would be the best way
12:03  DoFoT9: but im a GUI man :P
12:04  panosru: yeah I have checked :/
12:05  panosru: in my virtual machine when I run mount -t nfs 10.211.55.3:/Volumes/Web www I'm getting the error: mount.nfs: 10.211.55.3:/Volumes/Web failed, reason given by server: Permission denied :S
12:05  panosru: hows that? FFS :S
12:05  DoFoT9: are there any daemons on the host side that have to run for NFS?
12:07  panosru: hmm seems that there are running some nfsd deamons
12:07  DoFoT9: maybe try to restart them?
12:09  panosru: same thing :S
12:09  DoFoT9: bugger
12:09  panosru: its really very very very strange daaaaamn! :S
12:10 * DoFoT9 whispers - disk permissions
12:10  DoFoT9: :p
12:10  DoFoT9: it is indeed
12:10  DoFoT9: maybe try connect through another protocol?
12:10  panosru: I will try with a simple folder
12:10  DoFoT9: good idea, in a root dir maybe
12:15  panosru: same thing! :S every time I'm getting Permission denied ! :S omg I will throw my macbook through the window! F**K!
12:17  DoFoT9: are you able to connect to your mac from another computer?
12:17  DoFoT9: using NFS
12:18  panosru: I haven't try I will try to tail -f /var/logs/messages
12:18  panosru: to see what is going on
12:18  DoFoT9: good idea
12:20  panosru: there isn't any /var/log/messages in OSX? :S
12:20  DoFoT9: wow
12:21  aL3x: did someone say OSX? as in #macosx? yeah, i concur, it sucks
12:22  Foxdie: The princess is in another palace; /private/var/log/system.log
12:22  Foxdie: You can also try /private/var/log/secure.log
12:22  Foxdie: and even "dmesg" to get kernel messages
12:24  panosru: Foxdie: I will it thanks
12:26  panosru: Foxdie: nothing there too... what the heck... it reminds me the old Windows days when you shutdown your machine and you pray to boot normally the next time you boot it !
12:27  funyun: anyone know if Apple has black friday sales? and if so is it likely that the Macbook Pro's will go on sale? or is there any way to get discounts other than the student discounts?

12:27  funyun: DoFoT9: alright. thanks
12:28  DoFoT9: no probs, sorry to not give you any hope :P
12:28  DoFoT9: panosru: now that i think about it repairing permissions wont fix it by the sounds of it
12:29  DoFoT9: other then reinstalling  i dont know what else there is to do

12:51  panosru: nothing else
12:52  DoFoT9: OH
12:52  DoFoT9: thats explains it!
12:52  panosru: I'm more familiar with NFS I don't know how to install AFP on my debian
12:52  DoFoT9: netatalk
12:52  DoFoT9: ive got it on my ubuntu
12:53  panosru: ok I installing it now
12:54  DoFoT9: hehe
12:54  DoFoT9: :Pp
12:54  DoFoT9: yay im influential
12:54  panosru: should I configure it some how?
12:54  DoFoT9: yes
12:54  DoFoT9: let me get THE best guide for you :)
12:55 * DoFoT9 europe have price drops for MacMini. £649 to £599!

12:58  Branes: Putting Time Machine backups on an NFS server = bad idea.
12:59  DoFoT9: its not NFS branes
12:59  DoFoT9: its AFP
12:59  DoFoT9: and besides, he isnt setting up TM
12:59  DoFoT9: just giving a walkthrough on setting up AFP
12:59  Branes: Same thing.
12:59  DoFoT9: hehe
13:00  Branes: Time Machine is a dual ended protocol - storing backups on anything except a local disk, Time Capsule, or a Mac server, makes for a fragile, untrustworthy backup - they become corrupt far too easily.
13:00  DoFoT9: yes of course Branes but we are not discussing TM here currently
13:01  panosru: Branes: I don't want to have my time machine on NFS server :)
13:02  Branes: Good :)
13:02  DoFoT9: ahahahahah do you approve now :P
13:02  panosru: DoFoT9: too much to do on this guide :P I will stick with NFS instead of AFP  :P :P :P
13:03  DoFoT9: panosru: you only have to go in about to step 5 lol
13:03  DoFoT9: but sure, keep trying with NFS if u wish
13:03  alfonx: Hi. I would like to write a .cmd startfile for my software so it start nicer on macos (its a java program). Can someone please give me a link to examples or documentation about that file format!?  
13:03  panosru: ah ok let me check again :P
13:04  DoFoT9: panosru: just complete step 1-3
13:06  Branes: alfonx: OSX doesn't use .cmd ... what you can do is use Automator and write an AppleScript applet that can launch your Java program at log-in.
13:15  Chat3832: hey
13:16  panosru: if I run showmount -e I'm getting this: Cannot MNT RPC: RPC: Program not registered can't connect socket for RPC
13:19  Psixerces: Branes:  Technically you can create a double clickable .command file that can be used as a start up item  (Sorry it switched chans on me)
13:21  Psixerces: alfonx:  If you know the commands to launch the java app via Terminal, you can put them into a bash script, and save it as a .command file.   My memory is fuzzy on the exact procedure I followed to get the command working.  You need to make it executable however using chmod o+x filename
13:22  Psixerces: or you can embed the same terminal code into Automator like Branes suggested, and start it at log in that way too
14:14  panosru: hello does anyone knows why if I run showmount -e I'm getting this: Cannot MNT RPC: RPC: Program not registered can't connect socket for RPC ?

14:36  panosru: there is not exportfs command in OSX?
14:37  alfonx: Branes: Thanks. 
15:11  alfonx: Psixerces: i don't want to start the script at startup. I already have .sh startup scripts.. maybe i can just rename it to .command ? You think this file would start on mac? http://wald.intevation.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/gpswinggui/src/assembly/resources/start_Geopublisher.sh?rev=1730&root=atlas-framework&view=markup
15:33  shuaib: Hi, how do I assign command keys to spaces? I am trying to assign gestures to shifting between spaces
15:43  Tjololo12: I've got a question...I'm trying to make a password protected zip using the terminal app on OSX; Is it recursive? That is, if I give it the name of a folder, will it encrypt everything IN that folder? My command is zip -e Archive.zip Folder/ do I need to add an r or R?
15:45  Tjololo12: ah nevermind, I figured it out
15:57  nettezzaumana: heya
15:58  nettezzaumana: i have repaired MBP and i've also requested a HDD change .. can i boot from my old HD from USB ?
16:02  Tu13es: probably
16:04  nettezzaumana: Tu13es: well .. i asked badly .. usb boot won't run surely, but now there is a plan #B .. should i take a look for other mac and do from it a FW target and used it to boot from?
16:05  Tu13es: what are you trying to do?
16:06  nettezzaumana: boot from old 2.5" harddisk .. it contains a working leopard instance ... i have new disk in my MBP
16:06  nettezzaumana: s/old/previous/
16:07  nettezzaumana: sure, there is plan #C .. screwdrivers and little hacking to dismantle MPB and put old drive in there
16:12  Tjololo12: anyone know the encryption algorithm that zip uses?
16:20  webPragmatist: zip?
16:20  webPragmatist: oh
16:21  npoektop: is there a way to make adium to watch only selected room? iChat has this feature
16:21  npoektop: i mean to put messages count on app's icon
16:22  Tjololo12: webPragmatist: yeah, zip with the -e switch, do you know the encryption algorithm?
16:26  Tjololo12: so for anyone who needs to know, it's the insecure PKzip 2.0 algorithm (whatever that is). There's also zip -P, but that's no better.
