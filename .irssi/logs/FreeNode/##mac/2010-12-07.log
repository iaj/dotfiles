00:42  jeffmr: I'm trying to burn a dvd with idvd
00:42  jeffmr: [5:07pm] jeff__: and it goes through everything and encodes the video, then says multiplexing and burning
00:42  jeffmr: [5:07pm] jeff__: and then the dvd pops out before its done, the time continues running until it says done and then below, one minute remaining
00:42  jeffmr: [5:08pm] jeff__: there is nothing written on the dvd
00:42  jeffmr: [5:08pm] jeff__: the only option I have is to cancel and if I do that it says that it will have to be encoded again if I cancel
00:42  jeffmr: [5:08pm] jeff__: I've tried different quality settings in the project info window
00:42  jeffmr: [5:09pm] jeff__: all say that the amount of space being used is smaller than the disc allows
00:42  jeffmr: [5:09pm] jeff__: so thats fine
00:42  jeffmr: [5:09pm] jeff__: I've tried single layer and double layer discs
00:42  jeffmr: [5:10pm] jeff__: I think I've used this brand of disc before so I don't think its the brand
00:42  jeffmr: [5:10pm] jeff__: I've also cleaned my dvd recorder once before when I had some problems, I haven't cleaned it recently but this doesn't seem to be that problem

12:27  evilbug: i think it's a poor choice.
12:27 +Tomis: no, i've always hated how their model completely murders the trial model, leading to a wave of "lite" versions flooding the store
12:27 +Tomis: it just makes it a mess
12:27  theworkpatrol: these shitty trials are the reason i don't bother with the free section of the ios app store
12:27  evilbug: Tomis: well everything has a light version.
12:28  evilbug: well at one point i wanted to try out a logic trial. guess not.
12:28 +Tomis: and if they'd allowed for trials then there wouldn't be those freebie trials mucking up the listings
12:28  theworkpatrol: that's what they're getting rid of, though
12:28 +Tomis: of course it all comes down to money, and apple just doesn't want to pay for serving up free downloads which may or may not lead to sales

13:23  theworkpatrol: heh
13:23  imacode: you're very, very creative
13:23  imacode: thats good
13:28  imacode: is there any C/C++ developer here, who could compare development on mac and linux(ubuntu) ? Would be naiz
13:43  xushi: imacode: i would look into the comparision between BSD and it's clone, Linux.. That should give you a rough understanding
13:43  xushi: as OSX is a modified BSD kernel
13:43  xushi: as for the GUI side, i think that's mostly Objective C ?
13:45  imacode: huh.
13:46  imacode: i meant. general development
13:46  xushi: for applications?
13:46  imacode: yeah
13:46  imacode: native apps
13:46 +Tomis: you'd use Xcode
13:46  imacode: no
13:46  imacode: standard C++... =|
13:46  imacode: or java
13:46 +Tomis: no don't use java
13:46 +Tomis: for the love of god man
13:47  imacode: i know, i dont like it much
13:47 +Tomis: if you're making "native apps", use Xcode or don't bother, seriously
13:47  imacode: but on our university they teach us that
13:47  xushi: hmm, for OSX, you'd use Objective C. For *buntu, I would have imagined you'd use GTK, TCL/TK, etc... 
13:47 +Tomis: Obj-C, you can mix in C and C++ with it
13:47  imacode: ...
13:47  imacode: i know what languages there are out
13:47 +Tomis: but Xcode would be the dev environment
13:48  imacode: i wanted to get compared  "C/C++/Java" development
13:48  imacode: is xcode an IDE or language ?
13:48  xushi: you can't.. they're different systems that use different (similar) languages
13:48  imacode: no!
13:48  imacode: oO
13:48  imacode: I want to code in C++
13:48  imacode: not Java or Xode
13:49  imacode: i want my applications to be available for windows and linux and mac
13:49  xushi: it's not what "you want" to code in, it's what "you need to" code in, depending on what OS you're on :)
13:49 +Tomis: ewww
13:49 +Tomis: to do the UI right, you need to do it in Xcode
13:49  xushi: heck I want to code in 16 bit assembly on OSX.. I doubt i'll get anywhere :)
13:49  imacode: i dont want UI
13:49  imacode: console apps
13:49 +Tomis: Xcode is just the native dev environment
13:50  xushi: imacode: read about Xcode in Apple's pages
13:50 +Tomis: you can do console apps in it just fine as well
13:50  imacode: netbeans ?
13:50  xushi: it's the dev env, of which includes the IDE, the compilers, the dev tools, etc.. 
13:50  xushi: http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html
13:50  imacode: anyway, i more likely meant overall impressions
13:51  imacode: because the filesystem differs and the look differs and theres no taskbar etc
13:52  xushi: wasn't there a mac dev channel somewhere?
13:52  xushi: imacode: start with #MacOSX , they might give you more details
13:53 +Tomis: #macdev or something
13:53 +Tomis: you can find books are articles online targetting developers coming to the mac from a different OS
13:54  xushi: imacode: for CLI, give FreeBSD a look. It shouldn't be that different
13:54  imacode: im on ubuntu

14:49  Tu13es: if there's a VNC client app
14:49  koro: imacode: that requires jailbreak

14:50 +Tomis: yea, there's nothing to do that without a jailbreak koro 
14:50  koro: goddammit
14:50  Angostura: What sort of thing do you want to control?
14:50 +Tomis: trying to make an automated testing suite?
14:51  koro: it would be so useful; i keep my ipod touch mostly docked in the sound system, it would be cool to be able to control at least the itunes app from my ipad
14:51  koro: Tomis: haha no, it's much more mundane
14:51 +Tomis: open itunes on a mac, connect mac to sound system, open remote.app
14:52  koro: wait what
14:52 +Tomis: remote is only for controlling itunes on a computer
14:52  koro: i knowi can remote control my mac
14:52  koro: that's not what i want
14:52 +Tomis: not for controlling another iDevice
14:52 +Tomis: simpel as that
14:52  koro: i don't keep my mak docked to my sound system :|
14:52 +Tomis: run an audio cable to it
14:53  koro: yes, "remote" the apple app is not for controlling another idevice, that's why i'm asking if there's *another* app that serves that purpose
14:53 +Tomis: or get an airport express and sling your media to it from wherever
14:53 +Tomis: there isn't
14:53 +Tomis: because it's not designed for that
14:53  koro: uh, how come it's not "designed" for that
14:53 +Tomis: because it's not
14:53  koro: you're wrong
14:54 +Tomis: no, apple is
14:54  koro: you can't claim to know what the ipod touch is "designed for"
14:54 +Tomis: they're not giving what you want
14:54 +Tomis: so send them a feature request
14:54 +Tomis: yes i can, lol
14:54 +Tomis: the thing doesn't do what you want, it's not designed to do it
14:54  koro: the fact that it has app development open for you to create new shit shows that you're wrong
14:54 +Tomis: no
14:54  koro: in fact iphones now can do much more stuff than it could when it was released
14:54 +Tomis: that's great
14:54  koro: and some of these things were'nt even thought by apple
14:55 +Tomis: apps exist inside a sandbox
14:55  koro: so what?
14:55  koro: apps have access to my music library if i want to
14:55 +Tomis: so there are limitations on what they can do
14:55  koro: hence i could have an app that gives me remote control to my music library
14:55 +Tomis: great

14:56 +Tomis: he wants to control an iOS device from another iOS device using remote.app
14:56  koro: Tomis: are you stupid? i never said i want to use remote.app
14:56  EdLin: Tomis: oh, nm then.
14:56 +Tomis: except that iOS isn't controllable by remote.app 
14:56  koro: jesus
14:56  koro: stop being such a moron
14:56  EdLin: right
14:56 +Tomis: fine, so you want *some* app to control the other iOS device

16:29  Tekhne: on mac terminal, in a bash shell, when i run "echo -e '\ektext\e\'", it echos that full string as if there were no escape characters. is there a way to ensure that string interprets the escape sequences?
16:29  Tekhne: i figured the "-e" flag would do it. works on linux and solaris, but doesn't seem to work on my mac.
16:34  Marctraider: tekhne: you could always try using another terminal program
16:34  Marctraider: aterm or something similar? 
16:35  Tekhne: Marctraider: hmm, maybe
16:35  Marctraider: Then you would at least know a little more about whats causing it
16:35  Tekhne: i hand't thought of doing that
16:36  Tekhne: yea
16:36  Tekhne: i'm assuming i would get those from macports, yes?
16:36  Marctraider: And if you really wish to use the mac terminal, you could proceed by figuring out how to resolve it
16:36  Marctraider: um
16:36  Marctraider: i am not sure actually, i do have macports tho

16:37  Marctraider: Yeah thats quite possible
16:37  Tekhne: Angostura: well, i'm not sure, but probably the shell

16:38  Tekhne: which theoretically has a -e flag
16:38  Tekhne: but it doesn't seem to be working

18:02  Marctraider: No. laptop, desktop, looks :P
18:02  imacake: eh, i meant OS
18:02  imacake: and OS is more important for me than the type. but well
18:02  imacake: i would get something good
18:03  imacake: iMac with best hardware...
18:03  torchie: is the thinkpad T410 the same as an envy 17
18:03  Marctraider: Well i didnt really buy my mac because of mac osx
18:03  torchie: there are two things that matter in this world
18:03  torchie: the os and the trackpad
18:03  imacake: food
18:03  Marctraider: but because the macbook pro is one of the best notebook around
18:03  torchie: the os will supply you food
18:04  torchie: yo
18:04  torchie: ever
18:04  imacake: *no comment*
18:04  torchie: everybody wants a macbook pro because they are so bitchin
18:04  imacake: i worry a bit about compatibility of my apps
18:04  imacake: well, not 'my'
18:04  imacake: but linux is a good dev platform, too
18:06  torchie: linux dev is like rehearsing in a concert hall with a grand piano
18:06  imacake: the facts why i consider a mac: i need a new computer anyway. It is UNIX-based, thus has most of the stuff linux has too. it looks nice. i like the dock.
18:07  torchie: mac os x: UNIX, except you can use it!
18:07  imacake: no...
18:07  imacake: o.O
18:08  imacake: torchie. linux might be a better dev platform than mac
18:08  torchie: well I mean you can "use" anything
18:08  torchie: but osx is usable
18:08  Marctraider: imacake: you can use virtualization for your apps :p
18:08  imacake: linux too
18:08  imacake: eh, i prefer native stuff
18:08  Marctraider: linux = buggy :p
18:08  imacake: ie i dont like the JVM too
18:08  imacake: NO
18:08  torchie: JVM is bull
18:08  Marctraider: I came from Linux
18:08  torchie: which linux 
18:08  imacake: ^agreed
18:08  Marctraider: But i would never prefer it to be my main os again
18:09  imacake: mac cant run without gui...
18:09  torchie: the kernel is made of stainless steel and unicorn tears
18:09  imacake: torchie, 
18:09  imacake: do you even know what kernel it uses ?
18:09  imacake: >.>
18:09  imacake: research that better
18:09  torchie: i said, the linux kernel is made of stainless steel and unicorn tears
18:10  imacake: both
18:10  Marctraider: lol:p
18:10  imacake: and linux kernel is better
18:10  imacake: bah
18:10  imacake: :P
18:11  imacake: hi fujisan 
18:11  bterm: what lib is uuid hidden in?
18:11  fujisan: hi imacake 
18:11  fujisan: no clue
18:11  imacake: bterm, kernel ?
18:12  imacake: UUIDs should be handled by kernel. because thats very hardare-like

18:19  imacake: yo Branes 
18:20  imacake: oh btw. is the Mac FS case-sensetive ?
18:20  imacake: are there links ?
18:20  soahccc: HOW NEWS: Cut & paste in Finder! Never seen feature!11elf (on macs)... It is so fantastic awesome amazing :-)
18:20  soahccc: imacake: Not at default but you can format it so (or a partition)...
18:21  soahccc: I'd done that for my coding partition
18:21  imacake: ew
18:21  imacake: that sucks
18:21 +Branes: HFS is case-preserving but case-insensitive by default, and should always be used that way. There is a case-sensitive option, but enabling it stops many programs (such as all the Adobe suites) from working.
18:21  soahccc: But you shouldn't do that with you system partition, some programs can't work with it
18:22 +Branes: 'cut' in Finder is a security risk - because of the way Apple have coded the file system, you should *never* use the "add the cut feature" hack; not only does it dramatically increase the chance of losing the file totally, it makes the system unstable.
18:24  soahccc: Branes: Why anyone says this is dangerous? Apples implementation is sensless if it is dangerous. I use totalfinder and their implementation is safe
18:24 +Branes: The most important rule of MacOS, *ever*, is this: Never *EVER* upgrade, downgrade, edit, move, delete or otherwise change, *ANY* file installed by Apple, because the system will inevitably implode if you do, and the only fix is a full re-installation of the OS. They hard-code to their own code-base.
18:24  tehbaut: <3 totalfinder :)
18:24 +Branes: soahccc: It is a limitation of the HFS file system. TotalFinder is a hack.
18:25  tehbaut: <3 cocoa hacks :)
18:25  Psy: o-O
18:25  ShawnRisk: how do I edit .ai without Adobe Illustrator?
18:25  soahccc: Branes: Cut is a virtual <<<<<<<< !!!!! command. Why nobody want to check that -.-
18:25  tehbaut: ShawnRisk: I don't think you can
18:26  ShawnRisk: tehbaut: there is no other programs I can use?  I can't use Photoshop?
18:26 +Branes: Photoshop can import Illustrator files, but it turns them into a bitmap
18:26  tehbaut: ShawnRisk: to view you can, but not to edit
18:26  soahccc: Branes: And mv is a hack too or what?
18:27  tehbaut: ShawnRisk: if viewing is all you need though, preview does that on its own
18:27  ShawnRisk: I need to edit this
18:27 +Branes: If you need to edit an Illustrator file, you need to have Illustrator.
18:27  tehbaut: you might also be able to open in preview and then re-save as PDF or whatever that open source vector format is
18:28 +Branes: That turns them into a bitmap as well, tehbaut
18:28  tehbaut: ah, there you have it

18:29 +Branes: clocKwize: No can do. Boot Camp requires an optical disc, it is hard-coded. Burn that sucker!

18:31  clocKwize: damn why is our internal nas slower to copy from than downloading >.< I get like 7mb/s to download but this 2.4gb iso is taking forever
18:33 +Branes: clocKwize: You have your OSX installer DVD on hadn as well? You'll need that.
18:33  clocKwize: erm, i just gave it back to the IT peeps
18:33  clocKwize: lol
18:33 +Branes: s/hadn/hand
18:33  clocKwize: why does it need that? O.o
18:33 +Branes: clocKwize: You'll need it. It's got the Boot Camp driver-pack on it.
18:34 +Branes: Trying to run the machine without Apple's drivers can prove fatal to your hardware.
18:35  clocKwize: lies ;/
18:35 +Branes: (and before you ask, no you can't download the Boot Camp pack off Apple, once again, it is hard-coded to expect the optical disc)
18:35 +Branes: Not lies. Apple use a custom power management chip, without the right drivers the CPU is left over-volted.
18:36  Marctraider: branes what about during the windows installation?
18:36  Marctraider: I dont assume the driver is loaded then? :p
18:36 +Branes: Nope.
18:36  clocKwize: i see.. i'll go get it ;)
18:36  Marctraider: So thats dangerous as well?
18:36 +Branes: But the CPU is not under much load during installation.
18:36  Marctraider: well my mbp 2010 gets quite hot when installing windows 7
18:37  Marctraider: Since the fans are barely working then
18:37 +Branes: That's because every subsystem is running at nominal voltage.
18:37  Marctraider: But the CPU does have a intel specified 'safety range' dont they? like my desktop processor is normally around 1.3v but the range is to 1.5v
18:37  webPragmatist: hrm
18:38 +Branes: The CPU itself isn't under load, but everything is running, instead of having its power managed
18:38  webPragmatist: what's RCT stand for in terms of a meeting about it junk?
18:38  Marctraider: ok branes :p
18:38  Marctraider: So branes, are we talking about the SMC 'chip'? which sets voltage on the i5 processor in my case?
18:39 +Branes: They do, Marc, but Intel expect their ODMs to use a smart power controller to keep it within limits, but more importantly, adjust the Vcore as the temperature changes. Apple's can do that, but only under control of the host OS, it has no onboard smarts.
18:39 +Branes: Yes, the bane of my existence, right behind the accursed Intel processor.
18:39 * Branes hates the SMC
18:39  Marctraider: ehm
18:39  Marctraider: ok
18:40  Marctraider: Mhh i wonder why coolbook has such problems releasing a version for the new macbook pro's i5...
18:40  Marctraider: to control the voltage of the processor.
18:40  Marctraider: They told me it will not be possible at all to change the voltage manually
18:40 +Branes: Yup. New SMC with the Core i5/7.
18:41  Marctraider: It would be more efficient if one could set a manual voltage for a specific clock speed. this could be quite efficient
18:41 +Branes: It isn't, though.
18:41  Marctraider: possibly less heat, and battery savings
18:41 +Tomis: then you'd be wasting power when the cpu could be using less power
18:41 +Branes: It's not clockspeed that's crucial, but delta-T
18:41  Marctraider: Tomis: i mean undervolting
18:42 +Tomis: would be nice if they had a "slow" setting like the old PPC chips did though
18:42  Marctraider: I dont assume intel tested all of their processors on what the lowest possible voltage is to run it stable?
18:42 +Tomis: or better, if the backlight had a lower minimal setting before going off
18:43 +Tomis: why wuldn't they
18:43  Marctraider: For all our sakes it could run minus 0.1v (100mV)
18:43  Marctraider: or more
18:43 +Tomis: the cpu scales dynamically to fit the demands
18:43  Marctraider: Yes, but the voltages that belong with the clock speed is probably a fixed value which is not different on all processors
18:44  Marctraider: Thats why they made that program called coolbook
18:45  Marctraider: I know the processors voltage scale with the clock speed, ofcourse. but that doesnt mean those voltage values couldn't be decreased.
18:46  Marctraider: Unless intel specifically tests their processors at the lowest possible voltage on every clockspeed, and checking whether it keeps stable.
18:46  Marctraider: but if that were true, the term undervolting wouldn't  exist.
18:46  Marctraider: Or am I talking strange here? :p
18:46 +Tomis: hmm
18:47 +Tomis: so you can turn off hyperthreading, and switch to one core only
18:47  Marctraider: Ehm
18:47  Marctraider: No thats not what I ment actually
18:47 +Tomis: no i'm looking at the processor prefpane that comes with the developer tools
18:48 +Tomis: i can't really tell if it helps battery life though
18:48  Marctraider: Tomis: thats interesting
18:48  Marctraider: how do you get this pref?
18:48 +Tomis: install Xcode, the apple developer tools
18:48  Marctraider: i have it :)
18:49 +Tomis:  /Developer/Extras/PreferencePanes/Processor.prefPane
18:49  Marctraider: oki
18:49 +Tomis: it needs to be updated for 64bit it seams, and the menu extra doesn't work for me
18:49 +Tomis: doesn't look like turning stuff off makes a big impact on battery life as far as i can tell
18:49  Marctraider: ill check it out
18:50  Marctraider: tomis: probably not
18:50 +Tomis: would only affect max system performance probably
18:50  Marctraider: what macbook do you have?
18:50 +Tomis: base model MBP 15", current gen
18:50 +Tomis: upped the HD to 500GB 7200rpm
18:50  Marctraider: ok im going to check if it makes any difference
18:51  Marctraider: i have the same book
18:51 +Tomis: i was judging it based on the battery life estimate, btw
18:51 +Tomis: highly unscientific
18:51  Marctraider: hehe :p
18:51 +Tomis: it was hanging around 7:30 for a bit while i was switching stuff on/off
18:52 +Tomis: oh, just jumped to 8:30, now down to 7:40, lol
18:52  Marctraider: im going to check with the options on, and when the time stabilizes, i will turn off the proc/ht
18:52  Marctraider: brb in some mins
18:52 +Tomis: probably be best to look at an actual reading of the system's power draw
18:53  Marctraider: oh and: disabling wireless, screen on max, Intel Video
18:53 +Tomis: you use gfxCardStatus?
18:53 +Tomis: i use that all the time, you can force the system to intel, nvidia, or dynamically switch GPUs
18:54 +Tomis: ad have it change based on the power source
18:54 +Tomis: so, get best performance when on AC, and best battery life

18:57 +Tomis: it already scales the CPUs back anyway

18:57 +Tomis: so really all we're doing is saying lower the maximum performance
18:57  Marctraider: Tomos: bu i dont think it changes much
18:58 +Tomis: not if you're not pushing the CPU hard no Marctraider 
18:58  Marctraider: unless for instance you do more then sitting and staring at your monitor ;p

23:08  the_student: How good is Xcode on the Mac Mini, should I do a RAM upgrade, which processor speed should I choose? 
23:10  LordDragon: the_student, the faster the cpu the better for compiling.
23:11  the_student: LordDragon: Sure, but is it worth the cost?
23:12  LordDragon: the_student, that all depends on how much work you are gonna do and how important time is to you. if you dont mind waiting a little longer, then its fine. macmini makes a great entry level low cost mac to learn xcode and develop with. but of course if your super serious about development, you go with one of the more expensive models
23:17  the_student: LordDragon: Ok, but compared to the performance increase per dollar, which one is best, RAM or CPU, btw non-Apple ram is a solution
23:17  LordDragon: oh defintely
23:17  LordDragon: i would not buy apple ram
23:17  LordDragon: its way overpriced
23:18  LordDragon: you can get some cheap but good quality ram from macsales.com
23:18  LordDragon: well for compiling code, cpu is more important
23:21  LordDragon: but since ram is cheap and easily upgraded by the user, id focus on a better cpu
23:21  LordDragon: since they are not upgradeable
23:21  LordDragon: you can always add more ram later
23:21  the_student: LordDragon: So the 2.6GHz?
23:22  LordDragon: to be honest, your not gonna see much different between 2.4 and 2.66
23:23  LordDragon: i was only saying, if your thinking of adding either more ram or a beter cpu, better to focus on the cpu, since its permanent
23:23  LordDragon: the 2.66 has a bigger hdd though
23:23  LordDragon: actually it has dual 500gb
23:23  LordDragon: which means you dont get an optical drive with the 2.66 model
23:24  LordDragon: the_student, are you just beginning with xcode and mac development?
23:25  the_student: Yes
23:25  LordDragon: ah
23:26  LordDragon: i think the base model would be fine for you for now
23:26  the_student: But also macs
23:26  LordDragon: its a powerful little mac and can do everything you'd want it to
23:27  alexlea: even the low end macs are good
23:27  alexlea: it's not like pc;s, where when you get the cheapest one it doesnt even work
23:28  LordDragon: alexlea, hey. thats what i told him. the base model of the macmini is as low end as macs get :P
23:28  alexlea: :P
23:28  LordDragon: he was asking about if he should spend the extra for the 2.66cpu
23:28  LordDragon: but hes only just beginning with macs and xcode
23:28  the_student: Problem is that i know i will regret it If i bought the baseline
23:28  alexlea: my macbook, thats 4 yearsold, runs xcode fine
23:29  LordDragon: so i figure the base model is perfect for someone just getting in to th ewhole thing
23:29  alexlea: so i know any new one will
23:29  alexlea: the_student: all mac minis are baseline, they suck
23:29  LordDragon: the_student, why would you regret it?
23:29  alexlea: might as well get the cheapest one
23:29  LordDragon: alexlea, shush :P i have a macmini. it doesnt suck at all
23:29  alexlea: well, they dont suck...what i mean is that they are all the same as one anther
23:29  alexlea: LordDragon: what!?!?! WTH LordDragon wth
23:30  the_student: Oops: i meant if performance was unsatisfactory
23:30  alexlea: mac mini, mac pro, macbook, netbook...2 iphones....STOP THE INSANITY
23:30  LordDragon: alexlea, hahahahaha. welcome to my life :)
23:30  alexlea: the_student: HORRID graphic cards are the issues of all macs except the pro
23:30  Angostura: the_student:  What do you intend to do with the 2 minutes you can save during a big compile?
23:31  LordDragon: the_student, your not gonna get any more performance out of the 2.66 than you would with the 2.4. it wont even be noticeable probably unless your timing how long it takes to compile
23:32  LordDragon: alexlea, i have a friend who spends all her paycheck every week on figures and dolls. some collect dolls, i collect computers and gadgets DONT JUDGE ME!! hehe
23:32  the_student: alexlea: Dont need a powerful GPU, will have to use it over VNC
23:33  the_student: Angostura: I am not really sure
23:33  alexlea: LordDragon: i judge you...and all people who collect crap
23:33  alexlea: LordDragon: dolls, etc are definately way worse
23:34  LordDragon: alexlea, lol. its not "crap". its useful! and they all have their purpose
23:34  Angostura: the_student: So save your money
23:34  alexlea: LordDragon: i think it's wasteful to ahve more than one needs
23:34  Angostura: Sorry - how many Macs did you have again?
23:35  LordDragon: alexlea, "need" is relative. i dont NEED macs at all. im sure i could get by with just a pc netbook for 200 bucks. but im a techno geek. i do alot more than the average user
23:35  alexlea: LordDragon: it's wasteful in many ways, not just the obvious. like it wastes your energy too, attending to all the different devices...or that chick attending to all the dolls..etc
23:35 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
23:36  the_student: alexlea: MacGyver keeps a swiss Army knife yet i Dont Think he really use it very often
23:36  LordDragon: i have a swiss army knife too :)
23:36  alexlea: need is relative, i agree
23:36  alexlea: i only need a laptop
23:37  LordDragon: macgyver was my idol as a kid :P
23:37  alexlea: BUT, like if i was advising someone else, I think having a home computer with a large screen, and then a portable makes sense
23:37  the_student: alexlea: I only need food and water
23:37  alexlea: i dont get people who have like 30 inch computer monitors AND large tvs
23:38  LordDragon: alexlea, well my computer screen is 22in. computer lcd's and tv's are very different. different pixel sizes, different resolution, different inputs
23:38  alexlea: the_student: i onlny need coffee and cigarettes...andvitamin pills
23:38  the_student: LordDragon: Mine too, though i couldnt see it in the 80s
23:38  LordDragon: my lcd tv is 32in
23:39  alexlea: i like minimal -ness
23:39  the_student: alexlea: Still alot of unneccessity
23:39  alexlea: iLOVE that my macbo is everything...my library, stereo, tv, movies, etc
23:39  alexlea: macbook*
23:39  alexlea: the_student: yeah ok...i you wanna get all literal :P
23:40  alexlea: all we need is food and water...if you live where i am...in other places you prolly need clothes so you dont freeze
23:41  the_student: No, in reallity everything you have listed is unneccesary
23:41  alexlea: LordDragon: i am gonna call taht show that makes people throw things away, and send them toyou
23:41  the_student: Opps
23:41  LordDragon: alexlea, my macmini is my home server. it runs my irc bots, ftp server, shoutcast server, etc
23:42  alexlea: LordDragon: i WANT everything cool and techno-ey that i see, so i understand
23:43  alexlea: whenever i am in best buy, i touch all the ipads, macbook airs, macbook pro,s imacs,etc...its like a drug
23:43  LordDragon: hehe
23:44  the_student: Computers Are drugs to computer nerds
23:44  alexlea: yeah
23:44  LordDragon: alexlea, well all my gadgets and computer have specific purposes. also when my mac pro's hdd konked out, i used my macbook as my primary computer for about a week. i adjusted to it and was comfy. so i know i can live without the mac pro, but when i got back to the macpro i was glad
23:44  alexlea: me and my little brother were tlaking about that, he called me a computer junkie, and i took his ipod and stuck it agiants my arm, pretending like i was injecting it into my vains
23:45  the_student: Haha
23:46  alexlea: LordDragon: i mind meld with my computers....i cant be attached to more than 1....it becomes my secondary brain
23:48  alexlea: LordDragon: are all your computers synced?
23:48  LordDragon: alexlea, my mind meld is with my data. when my mac pro's OS hdd died, i was lost. until i whipped out my usb to HD adapter, i removed my data drive from the macpro and connected it to my macbook pro, and all was right again
23:48  alexlea: or are they each dong their own thing
23:49  LordDragon: alexlea, they all do their own thing for the most part. though i do sync SOME stuff with dropbox
23:49  alexlea: LordDragon: i used to only meld with the data...back when i had no computer, and used uploade sites and floppies
23:50  alexlea: lol...floppies
23:50  LordDragon: dont copy that floppy!
23:50  LordDragon: :P
23:50  alexlea: i had a really cool one that was clear blue and sparkly... loved it
