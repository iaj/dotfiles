00:00  KeeperOfTheSoul: it always seems to give me that these days
00:00  Tomis: threaten it with a sharp object KeeperOfTheSoul 
00:01  Tomis: try deleting the caches?
00:01  Tomis: when in doubt, throw the cache outs
00:02  KeeperOfTheSoul: more annoying is it likes to take over 5 minutes to start up, during which time it is listed as not responding

12:32  philosophically: hmm i'm getting a circle with a diagonal line through it on the apple gray screen...
12:36 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
12:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: is there anyway to keep a specific window always on top?
13:00  Branes: philosophically: that symbol can mean either a hardware fault, or the disc you are trying to boot from will not work with that machine
13:00  Branes: KeeperOfTheSoul: No, unfortunately not
13:01  philosophically: Branes: hmmm thanks for the advice :)
13:01  KeeperOfTheSoul: so no 3rd party addons or the like?
13:01  Branes: it has to be something programmed in, you can't make any arbitrary window stay where you want
13:01  topriddy: so am enjoying my macbook pro...#justsaying
13:01  KeeperOfTheSoul: Branes: does OSX not have a keep on top flag then?
13:02  topriddy: just wondering whats the average lifetime...my dell served me well for 3years during which i changed battery 3 times and charger like 5times
13:02  Branes: philosophically: The iLamps are very fussy, it is possible to over-tighten the base screws and cause the board to flex.
13:02  philosophically: Branes: hmm thats a really good tip!
13:03  Branes: No it doesn't, keeper, it has a different class of window (modal palette) which can stay on top. Choosing window class is only possible from within the program.
13:04  KeeperOfTheSoul: ah right, havn't really done any coding for OSX
13:04  Branes: topriddy: average usable life-span for most Macs (portable or otherwise) seems to be five years.
13:05  topriddy: should have saved some money by then LD
13:06  KeeperOfTheSoul: my still seems to be going strong, and its about 6 years now and a pint of hot coffee
13:06  Branes: that said, I still see eight and nine year old machines in excellent condition :)
13:24  topriddy: hi fellas
13:34  eor: hi
13:34  eor: how can i remove a hidden file without using Terminal.app ?
13:35  philosophically: eor: try downloading tinker tool
13:36  philosophically: eor: it has an option to launch finder to show hidden files, you can toggle this feature
13:36  eor: ah okay :D
13:36  eor: cheers
13:38  philosophically: Branes: i loosened the screws... i started the imac g4 up and held down option (holding down c doesnt do anything for me), i get to the screen and it shows the disc, i wait for everything to load and the watch to disappear, then i click the arrow pointing right, it shows the gray screen with the apple logo, about 20 seconds go by and i have the circle with a diagonal line through it... i'm using panther install discs...
13:38  philosophically: they are working fine on my new macbook.. what do you think?
13:39  LSD`: err... panther install discs shouldn't work on a new MacBook...
13:39  Branes: philosophically: retail 10.3? Or are they grey-labeled ones from another Mac?
13:40  philosophically: Branes: looks like they might have come with this one.. they are not burned
13:40  philosophically: LSD`: just put them in to see if it could read them
13:41  Branes: Find the one that mentions the hardware test on it, and try to boot from that by holding the option key down on power-up and choosing it
13:47  philosophically: Branes: ... looking... checked disc 2, now checking disc 3
13:49  philosophically: Branes: checking disc 1...
13:50  philosophically: Branes: looks like its on disc 1... i'm going to try putting it in again
13:51  philosophically: Branes: ok, it didnt work... can i burn my own?
13:52  Branes: only if you've got the same model of iMac
13:52  philosophically: Branes: nope :(
13:52  Branes: grey discs are always machine-specific (with a few, very few, exceptions)
14:05  thelostpatrol: what is isync and where is it on my mac?
14:06  topriddy: ~rbi
14:36 --- LouisJB_ is now known as LouisJB
14:58  danl: thelostpatrol: it is an app in the main applications folder, it was originaly used to sync non-apple products, and is used for some MobileMe and iTunes syncing troubleshooting
14:58  LSD`: I used it to sync my old Z550i for a while there
