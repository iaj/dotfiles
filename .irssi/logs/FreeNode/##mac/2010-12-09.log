00:43  derp: How do i format a sd card so it's readable & writable under windows
00:44  Necrosan: fat16/fat32
00:44  derp: yes
00:44  Necrosan: or ntfs
00:44  mrapple: Use disk utility
00:44  derp: But it's a 8 GB card
00:44  derp: So FAT doesn't work at all
00:44  Necrosan: I have an 8gb card with fat on it...
00:44 * derp checks
00:48  derp: Ugh
00:48  derp: it doesn't work
00:48  derp: :(
00:50  Kasm279: derp: format it as FAT32
00:51  derp: How can i force a format to format32

01:59  samosa: Hi
01:59  Kasm279: hi
01:59  samosa: what is a hackintosh?
02:00  b3ny0-: a pc running osx
02:01  Kasm279: all computers that run Mac OS are PCs....
02:01  Kasm279: anyway
02:01  S_SubZero: shoehorning OS X to run on hardware it was not intended to be run on
02:01  Kasm279: hackintosh = a non-apple branded computer running OSX
02:03  samosa: oh
02:03  samosa: I had a question about that :(
02:04  samosa: But its more about battery life not the OS or trying to get the OS itself on pc
02:06  Kasm279: we can't support it as it violates freenode's ToS :\
02:06  samosa: I was wondering has anyone like tried running windows and osx on same exact hardware and testing battery life and seeing how they compare? (there have been many tests showing on mac, how windows and ubuntu have much worse battery life, but cant find any on opposite situation)
02:07  S_SubZero: OS X is only intended to be run on Macs.
02:07  S_SubZero: Kasm279: forget the ToS.  Just "supporting Hackintosh" is a nightmare and avoiding it is the best course of action .
02:08  Kasm279: lmao
02:11  samosa: So I take it you guys all own macs?
02:11  samosa: cool
02:11  Kasm279: five of them
02:11  Kasm279: all G3s except for an SE from 1987
02:12  samosa: Im thinking about switching, not now (no money lol)...but maybe next year...honestly tired of battery life. sucks. 2 hours.
02:12  S_SubZero: Macbooks get good battery life depending on how you use them
02:13  staticsafe: indeed my Macbook Pro gets great battery life
02:13  ErrantEgo: ive got a B&W G3
02:13  staticsafe: it's a late 2009 model though
02:13  ErrantEgo: using it right now as a matter of fact :)
02:14  samosa: staticsafe: But do they still hold good battery life after 1 year, 2 years? thats what scares me...if battery goes bad...how to replace...theres no way you can do it
02:15  staticsafe: samosa: it's been a year since I had, and I have not noticed any significant degradation in battery life
02:15  staticsafe: had it*
02:16  staticsafe: samosa: you can replace the battery, but you have to obviously pay for the battery
02:16  staticsafe: if you can replace it yourself, have fun
02:16  staticsafe: i think it's a pain to remove those screws in the back of a aluminum unibody MBP
02:17  samosa: S_SubZero: I agree battery life is highly dependant on how you use them. How is worst case scenario? (like playing video which is pretty high res/bitrate but no gpu decoding, pure cpu load, and flash web broswing?)
02:17  staticsafe: samosa: or continuous use of wireless at the same time
02:17  staticsafe: that would kill the battery
02:18  samosa: staticsafe: Macbooks - Yeah, I heard you can go to apple store and have them replaced by paying. But Im thinking macbook air 13 inch - I heard the battery cannot be replaced on those, even at store, its like literally soldered to mobo...would need to replace entire laptop
02:20 --- Tombar_ is now known as Tombar
02:21  staticsafe: samosa: yes you're out of luck with the new Airs
02:21  staticsafe: one reason I would never buy one
02:22  samosa: Yeah, but they are so THIN.
02:22  [Kevin]: what's the best video conversion program that'll let me drag and drop a bunch of files at a time to be converted for play on my phone
02:23  samosa: handbrake
02:23  samosa: wait, are you talking about iphone?
02:23  staticsafe: handbrake is win
02:23  [Kevin]: droid but it takes the same codecs
02:23  samosa: handbrake devs use macs , i asked them :P
02:24  samosa: ah, cool, another fellow android user, I have desire
02:24  [Kevin]: the last time I tried handbrake I couldn't figure out a way to add a bunch of files by dragging and dropping them all
02:24  [Kevin]: I had to add each file manually
02:24  [Kevin]: I may have been doing it wrong though
02:25  staticsafe: [Kevin]: you have to add them all manually
02:25  [Kevin]: for example if I had a whole season of a tv show that I wanted to convert
02:25  staticsafe: they get added to a queue
02:25  [Kevin]: well that's not going to work, I have 125 files to convert
02:25  samosa: [Kevin]: Do you have rockplayer? its an awesome app which basically plays all videos up to 480p
02:25  samosa: You really dont need to convert
02:25  [Kevin]: samosa, I tried, and the framerate was too slow 
02:25  samosa: was it HD or SD?
02:25  [Kevin]: despite the fact that my droid runs at 1200mhz
02:26  [Kevin]: I'm not sure what the video resolution was but it's 250mb for 25 minutes
02:26  [Kevin]: which is also a problem because I have about 800mb free on my sd card
02:26  samosa: lol ...thats an over kill...i have mine under clocked to 768 mhz (to save battery life) and it plays 600x350 content fine
02:27  [Kevin]: I have it at 1200mhz because I can >_>
02:27  [Kevin]: and it helps for PSX emulation
02:27  samosa: hmm ...200mb + for 25 min episodes seems high def (1280x720)...so thats probably why its stuttering
02:27  [Kevin]: yeah I'd need to convert them to a lower resolution
02:28  samosa: download SD content bro, then you wont need to convert
02:28  samosa: I try to avoid conversion at all costs...it takes ages...unless you have a core i7 + nVidia GTX 580 to help encode
02:29  [Kevin]: but I already have all this http://cl.ly/3X1K2h3a472q3e2m3A0z
02:29  samosa: LOL ONE PIECE!!!
02:29  samosa: <3
02:29  torchie: yeah it'd be great to just have a device that plays every format in every resolution ever
02:29  torchie: period
02:29  [Kevin]: the .avi files I've been converting with iSquint, but it doesn't seem to handle the mp4 or mkv
02:29  samosa: I watch that xD
02:29  [Kevin]: torchie: the galaxy s series handles a whole lot more than iOS or stock android
02:30  torchie: yeah
02:30  [Kevin]: if every other thing samsung changed didn't suck I'd get one
02:30  torchie: too bad about all the other stuff though
02:30  [Kevin]: the ultimate device for me that's out right now would be a samsung epic running cyanogenmod
02:30  staticsafe: One Piece, I don't watch a lot of mainstream anime anymore really
02:31  samosa: torchie: the tech is nearly their, theres already 2 android devices which can play nearly every format/bitrate/ up to 720p
02:31  [Kevin]: but I'm waiting for the dual core cpus to be out before I upgrade
02:31  torchie: what of 1080p
02:31  samosa: (galaxy S/nexus S)
02:31  [Kevin]: one piece is the only mainstream anime I really like
02:31  torchie: I hope the nexus S is just intermediate on the way to nexus 2
02:31  [Kevin]: why would you play 1080p on a 800x400 screen
02:32  torchie: because you don't have time to convert and the world is going to explode in 20 seconds and the instructions to deactivate the world-bomb are in high resolution and on a phone
02:32  samosa: torchie: my laptop can barely do 720p and has a 720p panel screen, so i dont really care much 1080p...even if a phone with 1080p capabilities comes along with tv-out....my 32 inch tv is only 720p :/
02:33  [Kevin]: then I'll use rockplayer and read frame by frame
02:33  samosa: lol
02:33  [Kevin]: I'm getting a new laptop soon, I'm thinking of waiting until after CES
02:34  [Kevin]: maybe I'll take advantage of mobile flash player and just stream one piece to my phone :|
02:34  samosa: moto is gonna release a tegra 2 phone with 1080p
02:34  samosa: (recording)
02:35  [Kevin]: my birthday's in february, I may wait til then to upgrade my phone and laptop
02:35 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
02:39  samosa: [Kevin]: But I feel the predicament your in...I tryed also watching one piece on my phone...but gave up...all the one piece fansubs are dead...the few left only do HD, and even their SD content...they use high profile h.264 mkv's...which basically is a killer
02:40  samosa: basically flash for one piece :S
02:40  [Kevin]: you know hulu has subtitles episodes on a 4 day delay from japanese air date
02:40  [Kevin]: 4 days is about how long fansubbers take
02:41  [Kevin]: if only there was a free hulu mobile android app
02:41  samosa: I dont live in USA...hulu is USA only.
02:41  [Kevin]: ah
02:41  [Kevin]: well watchop.com should work for you
02:42  samosa: yeah it does
02:42  samosa: but i hate flash
02:43  samosa: You wanna know something funny?
02:44  samosa: So my HTC desire right...I go to this flash video streaming website on my pc...artifacts and stuttering...then go to same website on phone...flawless
02:44  torchie: get a worse phone
02:44  samosa: another reason why i think maybe go mac...windows good for flash? not anymore
02:45  b3ny0-: windows was never good for flash
02:45  b3ny0-: just better than osx
02:45  samosa: whats wrong with osx and flash?
02:45  [Kevin]: yeah
02:45  [Kevin]: it sucks
02:45  torchie: flash is balls
02:45  [Kevin]: uses like 100% cpu
02:45  samosa: I tryed ubuntu and flash...works better than my flash in windows lol
02:45  samosa: [Kevin]: dude thats good!
02:45  [Kevin]: and still lags
02:46  samosa: in my windows...cpu is 120%
02:46  [Kevin]: wut
02:46  samosa: ya
02:46  samosa: its pretty bad
02:47  samosa: thats why i dont get why everyone with ubuntu or osx is moaning about how bad flash is. It could be worse, think about it; it could windows doing flash
02:48  samosa: i cant fathom how osx can be worse with flash than windows is
02:48  samosa: i mean my phone beats windows lol
02:48  samosa: gg
02:48  [Kevin]: why does video that sucks on my macbook work on my droid
02:48  samosa: google worked with adobe i guess, optimized it more with hardware
02:49  samosa: i gtg
02:49  samosa: been fun =]
02:51  fungz0r: what do you guys use as irc client?
02:51  [Kevin]: textual
02:51  fungz0r: ah i was just looking at that, how is it?
02:53  [Kevin]: good
02:55  fungz0r: have you use colloquy?
02:56  torchie: colloquy
02:58  MultiFinder: Colloquy is a nice client. Very clean, very simple, very Mac-like.
02:58  fungz0r: yeah i'm using it right now
02:58  fungz0r: just wondering what other people use
02:58  MultiFinder: I've been using it for years now.
02:59  fungz0r: how do you like copy a persons name if they're talking to you within the chat?
02:59  MultiFinder: Copy their name?
02:59  [Kevin]: tab button
02:59  MultiFinder: Type the first letter or two and hit tab
02:59  [Kevin]: I switched from colloquy to xchat to textual
02:59  torchie: yeah at this point even with colloquy's derps I enjoy no other client as much
03:00  [Kevin]: textual is by far the best
03:00  torchie: though I'd like to learn irssi for nerd kred
03:00  Tsavo: colloquy is certainly pretty
03:00  torchie: oh yeah let me take a look at this
03:00  Swian: best is relative
03:00  torchie: this "textual"
03:00  torchie: http://codeux.com/textual/private/images/textualScreenshot.png
03:01  torchie: I can get rid of the name list on the right right
03:01  [Kevin]: yeah
03:01  torchie: can i make it drop down from channels
03:01  [Kevin]: I think
03:01  fungz0r: all those colours
03:01  [Kevin]: I've tried before
03:02  MultiFinder: The thing I never liked about those kinds of clients was, well, I use a GUI to avoid having my computer look like that :P
03:02  [Kevin]: after getting used to colored nicks I can't go back
03:02  fungz0r: i don't mind colloquy
03:02  Swian: colloquy used to crash a lot
03:02  Tsavo: I wish Colloquy had colored nicks in it's "Standard" theme
03:03  Tsavo: y'all are red

03:03  Project_2501: my mind is under control of the psyonic tits of a friend of mine
03:03  Project_2501: o.o
03:03  Swian: I like XChat aqua, used ircle, babbel, colloquy
03:03  Project_2501: they are forcing me to work for them @3am
03:03  Project_2501: o.o
03:03  [Kevin]: o.o
03:04  fungz0r: lol
03:04  [Kevin]: tits can make people do a lot of things
03:04  Swian: my wife just ran off to play with her new ipad
03:04  torchie: colloquy still has a few strange quirks 
03:04  torchie: and wrecks memory D:
03:04  Project_2501: [03:04] <[Kevin]> tits can make people do a lot of things <- yeah, i noticed that 
03:04  Tsavo: Colloquy can't deal with spam at all
03:04  torchie: how do you "deal with spam"
03:04  [Kevin]: Textual is currently using 161.89 MB of memory.
03:04  [Kevin]: :x
03:04  torchie: wait what.
03:05  torchie: is that real or virtual
03:05  Project_2501: i worked all summer for them, and then again in autumn and again now...
03:05  [Kevin]: I dunno
03:05  [Kevin]: but I'm on a lot of channels
03:05  [Kevin]: I am on 36 channels while connected to 11 networks. I have 0 o:lines, 9 ops, 0 halfops, and 7 voices with power over 585 individual users.
03:06  Tsavo: colloquy is using 61mb real and 465 virtual on my machine
03:06  Project_2501: wow, 7 voices? poliphony? 
03:06  Project_2501: :D
03:06  [Kevin]: mhm
03:06  [Kevin]: you can train yourself to have 2 voices
03:07  torchie: 59 real 209 virtual
03:07  torchie: 6 channels
03:07  torchie: one network 
03:07  Project_2501: ah, don't care about me in my actual state i could laugh at "there is no individual, we are Geth"
03:08  Tsavo: Does anybody else ever shock their aluminum keyboard with static electricity?
03:08  [Kevin]: not I
03:08  Tsavo: whenever i wear jeans or are wearing slippers i get a little zap
03:08  Swian: 21mb Xchat
03:16  Project_2501: ok, work is done...
03:16  Project_2501: goodnight _o/
03:23  alexlea_: how do i change my freenode password
03:33  bonhoffer: i can't connect to any wireless through my mac
03:33  bonhoffer: i can connect to ssid's, but the only ip available is a link local one
03:33  bonhoffer: i thought it was my home router, but this is the case for any computer
03:33  bonhoffer: sorry, three different locations
03:35  bonhoffer: ip is 169.254.193.9
03:35  bonhoffer: with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0
03:36  bonhoffer: any thoughts?
03:36  bonhoffer: even what the problem might be?
03:37  bonhoffer: i think the computer is trying to connect through pppoe or something
03:41  bonhoffer: is there a way to get a subnet mask change in mac os x?
03:43  bonhoffer: i think i am getting a iana ip address
03:58  web_knows: i might know the answer already
03:58  web_knows: but anyway to "ignore" bad HD sectors with a Mac?
03:59  web_knows: kinda urgent..
04:00 +Branes: Ignore? No, but it's possible to mask them out with testing. Drive Genius can do that, but the process is very time intensive.
04:03  web_knows: Branes, would that save my HD, so I can keep up using it?
04:05 +Branes: Not for very long. Once a drive starts to develop bad sectors, its like a rapidly-spreading cancer. I would seriously look at replacing that drive as soon as you can.
04:05 +Branes: Eventually the drive's own electronics will go "nuh-uh! too many bad sectors, no access for you sonnyjim!"
04:08  web_knows: Branes, :)
04:08  web_knows: the point is
04:09  web_knows: I've been replacing disks on this macbook like, 3 times in the last 1.5 years
04:09  web_knows: and the macbook lays in a flat, stale table most of the time
04:15 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
04:16 +Branes: You haven't made the mistake of buying Sadgate, have you?
04:17 +Branes: Unless the errors are being caused by you, the other drives should be exchangable under warranty ... but if its a Sadgate, you've just been replacing one silver turd with another silver turd
04:18  web_knows: Branes, I guess during these 1.5 years, I went through Samsung and Western.
04:19  web_knows: Branes, yep, confirmed, the one just failing is Samsung
04:23  richardcavell: What do people think of the MacBook Air?
04:23  richardcavell: I'm not sure about it
04:23  richardcavell: It's an ultraportable.  That's good
04:23  richardcavell: 2 USB ports, an average CPU
04:23  richardcavell: I don't think I'd ever buy one
04:36  web_knows: Branes, sounds like the Repair function of Drive Genius would do the trick.
04:41 +Branes: That's what I was referring to. I've used it in cases like yours with people determined to eke more life out of a failing drive, and it's effective. But when I mean time-consuming, I mean it - a 250GB drive can take 36 hours.
04:45  web_knows: Branes, a 320 GB drive?
04:45  sdgds: simple ratio web_knows
04:46  sdgds: ~46 hours
04:46 +Branes: Aye, two days is not unreasonable, depends on the extend of the damage
04:47 +Branes: You won't be able to use the machine for anything else whilst testing is under way.
04:47 +Branes: And you'll want to have the machine in a room you don't live in or use frequently, because the fans will be running flat-out the entire time.
04:51  web_knows: Branes, thanks for the hints.
04:52  web_knows: but despite the noise around me, I always sleep well :)
04:52  web_knows: actually, I'm the one that will provoke more noise than the fans

08:04  b0o-yeah: wow all of wikipedia alexlea?
08:12 +Branes: There isn't really a lot there, data-wise. The full Mediawiki database of Wikipedia is available for download, and it was 9 or 10 GB worth, last time I looked.
08:14 +Branes: There's even a self-contained version you can put on a USB stick, soon as you plug it in it opens its own portable Firefox to the stored Wikipedia frontpage.
08:14 +Branes: Rather spiff :)
08:15  b0o-yeah: hmm I should download that so when my internet is down at times I can still use wikipedia 
08:16  richardcavell: but you won't get the most recent IP vandalism if you do that
08:17  richardcavell: You'll miss out on reading things like "The Mountain Gorilla is found in Uganda, on the MY COCK."

09:43  crilly: not including me
09:45  alexlea: what 2?
09:48  b0o-yeah: ? 3
10:03  q_a_z_steve: okay first off I just bought this macbook pro and I love it… I just need to make a few things fit my custom setup… I was going to compile pidgin, and I couldn't it said I needed intltools, which doesn't seem to be available ANYWHERE… so now what do I do about that?
10:04  q_a_z_steve: I just installed the XCODE, in order to even ./configure anything...
10:06  crilly: That's because Macs don't come with Linux installed.
10:07  crilly: They're made for the everyday person, with the odd advanced feature for the less computer-illiterate amongst us.
10:07  q_a_z_steve: well shouldn't I be able to compile from source then...?
10:09  crilly: You can, but it takes extra setup, as you've noticed. Try looking at something like Macports.
10:09  q_a_z_steve: I was on darwinports, but it's borked...
10:09  crilly: ah
10:09  q_a_z_steve: I didn't want to install either if I could avoid it.
10:09  crilly: Well installing the developer tools was the right first step
10:10  crilly: http://macosx.forked.net/comp.html
10:10  crilly: ignore that
10:12  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: get homebrew rather than macports, its better.
10:12  EdLin: !g homebrew ruby os x

10:15  q_a_z_steve: crilly: Am I wrong about darwinports? I was rather surprised that they said things like long live *THISPROJECT* and then I couldn't even manage to download the stupid thing. :@
10:16 +Branes: It's because on the Mac, the commandline is a third rate citizen, and Apple only want prople making programs which use *their* GUI :)
10:16 +Branes: s/prople/people
10:16  crilly: Indeed
10:18  q_a_z_steve: Branes: I fully agree, everyone is getting more and more scared of CLI. I remember being in High School with a bunch of Starcraft obsessed freaks, who when they saw me in cmd thought I MUST have been hacking!
10:19  panosru: Hello, is there any application to easily track in/out connections ?
10:19  panosru: I mean for example to identify which applications using the network currently with some details on it
10:19  q_a_z_steve: istat may help you
10:20  q_a_z_steve: sadly trialware
10:20  q_a_z_steve: panosru: ^^
10:20  panosru: I have istat but it just say the download and upload it doesn't give any report
10:20  panosru: thanks for answering thought :)
10:22  q_a_z_steve: panosru: Here again my solution would be to use CLI. Especially since Mac doesn't have anything like "Router Commander" TIKO
10:23  panosru: q_a_z_steve: I use netstat but I was wondering if there are any gui tools because not anyone here can use CLI tools (they complain like -in windows we have it-) :P
10:25  crilly: COuld use tcpdump
10:25  crilly: WHich would literally dump all the packets in front of you on the CLI
10:25  crilly: netstat can also be used to viw all active connections.
10:26  q_a_z_steve: panosru: yup. I hear you. I founded #scriptkiddies because I actually live for making my own solutions...
10:26  crilly: Script kiddies don't make their own solutions. In fact they're known for the complete opposite - using other people's work to bolster their own infamy. 
10:27  crilly: I can't believe how fast Spotlight is with this RAM upgrade
10:28  crilly: q_a_z_steve: If you're out to change that image though, then that's great :)
10:28  q_a_z_steve: crilly: true, which comes with the BAD connotation… I on the other hand have never fit into many people's molds for my computer usage - so I am forced to piece mill my own things together quite often.
10:29  q_a_z_steve: actually I just thought it would be something fun to have, beyond ##linux-coders and tha
10:29  q_a_z_steve: t
10:30  panosru: It is unbelievable that in OSX there is no application that monitors your network... :S
10:30  q_a_z_steve: crilly: Maybe I just need to RTM but when I run tcpdump it says no suitable device…?
10:31  q_a_z_steve: panosru:  I agree except for the fact that I have only recently needed anything like that. In fact I haven't even downloaded Router Commander, just found it for someone else, and it died there.
10:32  crilly: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11952794
10:32  q_a_z_steve: crilly: So am I stuck using Adium rather than Pidgin (I'll live, but it does kind of leave a loose end).
10:32  crilly: tcpdump works first time for me
10:33  crilly: Try: tcpdump -i en0
10:33  panosru: The thing is that I can't use router commander because I'm not in my own router, I'm in the office and for some strange reason my machine drain the bandwidth of the network and it is very strange because I don't download anything I work only with SVN here the only applications that are using bandwidth are socialite and couple of widgets that monitors 4 svn repositories for changes periodically
10:33  crilly: Depends if you're on your network via a wired or wireless connection though
10:34  q_a_z_steve: figured there was something I'd need to switch. Wasn't too worried.
10:34  crilly: q_a_z_steve: If you like making your own stuff, learn Python and use the PyObjC bridge between Python and Objective-C to access the Cocoa framework and make native apps in pure Python :)
10:35  q_a_z_steve: panosru: Ooh I just realized I have the full version of socialite I can transfer over here :D
10:35  panosru: lol
10:35  panosru: I bought it too, it is a nice application
10:37  crilly: Oh I need to try Socialite
10:37  q_a_z_steve: crilly:  One day. How about this: I want to install/build the OSE version of virtualbox. Need guest-utils and a bunch of other pieces I hear, in order to get 3d working for Unity - Ubuntu Natty
10:37  crilly: Well about it?
10:37  q_a_z_steve: panosru:  I didn't pay snaked some deal on twitter actually.
10:38  q_a_z_steve: crilly: I have the OSX standard version installed but I didn't know where to start to apt-get (as it were) these other pieces.
10:39  crilly: There is no other version of OS X - there are no 'home' or 'premium' variants.
10:39  crilly: There is OS X and OS X Server, that's it.

10:41  q_a_z_steve: crilly: what I mean by "standard" is I clicked on "Download for OSX" at first, now I have grabbed the bz2 for OSE but again, I don't know that I'll succeed in compiling :(
10:42  crilly: Berzerker: What?
10:42 +Berzerker: benches for the drive

10:47 +Berzerker: and no, I don't need anything more than that lol
10:48  crilly: since when was 2 the same as 5?
10:48  crilly: ;p
10:48  q_a_z_steve: 2+2=5
10:49  crilly: that's right well done

11:22  crilly: PATH is an environment variable. Try adding it to it
11:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
11:28  q_a_z_steve: crilly: Found this, but keep in mind I am trying to avoid fink/macports et al: "If you get an error saying that pkg-config is required, you need to add the path of pkg-config on your system to the XCode settings by adding the line 'PATH = /sw/bin:$PATH' (if you use fink) to the .xcconfig file (in the project's XCode settings folder. It may also be in /opt/bin if you use macports vs fink."
11:29  q_a_z_steve: I have no /opt folder, so I guess I need to find this project's XCode settings folder… Any ideas?
11:38  crilly: Nope. ot my area sorry.
11:38  q_a_z_steve: k, thanks for getting me this far, or shall I say deep ;)
11:47 +Branes: steve, 1: Apple's slotloader optical drives are notoriously bad, and the sound they make (akin to an angry donkey eating a bee) during insert & eject is normal. 2: if you're playing around behind the GUI, cardinal rule is this -- don't change, move or delete *anything* Apple installs unless you've got a full backup.
11:49  q_a_z_steve: kewl thx
12:00  Angostura: "an angry donkey eating a bee" I've been trying to place that sound for years - thanks
12:03  crilly: Branes: I agree that the slot-loading drives are terrible. They do the job, but they're slow and loud. I try to avoid using mine at all cost and have even considered an FW800 external.
12:06  Angostura: My one seems to produce little electronic tones when a disks is inserted, rather odd

13:31  carpii: you can reveal it

13:39  crilly: Rich_Morin: Good question

13:39  crilly: That's what Apple recommends and asks that developers use for storing data

13:53  denysonique: I haven't noticed that
13:54  denysonique: But in here #mac, you guys always say, that nothing is possible
13:54 +Tomis: what's he trying to figure out?
13:55  gasvara: Hi, I've a problem with mac ports. I'm on an i386 system (uname -p) but it seems to compile stuff for x86_64, which is very strange.
13:55  crilly: gasvara: Are you on Snow Leopard?
13:55  gasvara: crilly: yes.
13:56 +Tomis: what mac, what CPU gasvara 
13:56  crilly: OK, Snow Leopard is a 64-bit OS.
13:56  crilly: As is the CPU in your Mac.
13:56  crilly: But SL runs in 32-bit mode (on a kernel level) because it doesn't need 64-bit mode.
13:56  gasvara: it's an iMac, says intel core 2 duo
13:56 +Tomis: it's a 64bit processor then
13:56 +Tomis: so it's doing the right thing
13:57  gasvara: I figured as much. But the arch seems to be i386 anyway.
13:57 +Tomis: yes, the kernel runs in 32bit
13:57  gasvara: which makes me very sad, seeing as I can't compile against my port installed xlibs.
13:57 +Tomis: it can run 64bit processes just fine
13:57  gasvara: I know. But the linker chokes.
13:57  gasvara: I could recompile them all with +universal, but that's kinda ugly, innit?
13:58 +Tomis: why ugly, universal means it's 64bit/32bit
13:58 +Tomis: it's how most apps are these days
13:59  crilly: I just said all this!?!?!?
14:00 +Tomis: anyway, for macports-speciic help you may want to see if they have a channel of their own
14:00 +Tomis: or check the dev rooms
14:00 +Tomis: probably more people knowledgable on the subject there
14:00  gasvara: ok... well, I just thought that it's possible to run everything in 64bit mode, seeing as that would alleviate the need for +universal.
14:00  gasvara: dev room?
14:00 +Tomis: ##macdev or something along those lines
14:01  gasvara: (i just wanted to avoid having to recompile my whole ports lib with +universal :P)
14:01  gasvara: k, thanks.
14:02 +Tomis: and.. they have their own channel.. #macports

16:31 @crilly: Same here mate
16:32 @crilly: I will get an SSD next year when they're cheaper
16:32  MobGod: what is the most RAM to put in a mini ?

16:32 @crilly: MobGod: 4GB I think, maybe 8GB.
16:32 @crilly: js_: Nah when an SSD is only £100-£150, that's a much cheaper option than buying a new machine.
16:32  MobGod: 4 that should be a big boost from 2 on. mini right ?
16:33  js_: crilly: well, depends on what kind of performance you need

16:37  zer0her0: cheap-chinese-brand-best&cheap brand
16:37  zer0her0: they make the best ram

16:48  diffract|: maybe it is magic
16:48  diffract|: lots of things on the internet seem like magic to me
16:49 +Tomis: it's easier to just go buy some grapes and make your own wine than jump through all those hoops
16:49  diffract|: it's even easier not to drink alcohol
16:49  MobGod: lol 
16:49  zer0her0: yea go right to heorine
16:49  MobGod: Lmao

16:50 +Tomis: forsooth the day
16:50 * zer0her0 kicks tomis in the shins
16:50  diffract|: why would you take things that damage your body?
16:50  zer0her0: diffract|: why go outside
16:50  diffract|: it's already hard to stay healthy
16:50  MobGod: they all do 
16:50 +Tomis: i dont know why people choose to go to walmart, that is a good question diffract| 
16:50  zer0her0: diffract|: you do know that alcohol has positive effects in small amounts
16:51  MobGod: sup b0o-yeah 
16:51  diffract|: zer0her0: going outside has more pros than cons, unlike taking drugs
16:51  LzrdKing: Tomis: walmart sometimes has very good deals
16:51 +Tomis: all the ilelgal things in life have positive effects in small ammounts
16:51  zer0her0: Tomis: yep
16:51 +Tomis: that's why they're illegal, so they can sell it to you in pill form!
16:51  LzrdKing: stupid comcast just jacked up my bill $25 a month, now i have to call them and complain
16:51  zer0her0: diffract|: it's all about moderation
16:51 +Tomis: chemtrails!! CHEMTRAILS~~~ IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACY!!11!!
16:51 +Tomis: call them and cancel LzrdKing 
16:52  MobGod: ol 
16:52  MobGod: lol *
16:52  diffract|: zer0her0: that's what everyone says, but the reality is not everyone is able to moderate

16:52  js_: sucks that the cinema display isn't available as 24" anymore
16:52  zer0her0: LzrdKing: oh thanks reminds me i need to pay my wireless bill
16:52 +Tomis: it's 27" only now?
16:52  diffract|: zer0her0: so you have these drunk drivers taking the life of a person who had nothing to do with them
16:52  zer0her0: diffract|: and how is that my problem?
16:52 +Tomis: it's the sober people's fault for not watching out diffract| 
16:52  diffract|: zer0her0: the one that gets hit might be your son
16:53 +Tomis: people need to take more responsability
16:53  zer0her0: diffract|: i got hit by a stupid kid texting
16:53 +Tomis: if a bolder falls on you, you don't blame the boulder
16:53  LzrdKing: zer0her0: i've set all my bills up to be paid by credit card automatically; i just have to remember to pay the credit cards
16:53 +Tomis: you weren't watching out!
16:53  zer0her0: as did my parents
16:53  LzrdKing: but thats how i found out about the comcast bill; they charged my credit card $71 instead of $46
16:53 +Tomis: they love that LzrdKing , then you don't notice as they raise the rates
16:53  LzrdKing: since they aren't sending me staements by mail anymore
16:54  diffract|: Tomis: it isn't always like that.. it's hard to watch out for every car that drives within the constraints of the road and expect one of them to go off
16:54 +Tomis: need less cars on the road
16:54  LzrdKing: Tomis: well i was on the $20/mo internet plan which is normally for 6 mo, but i made them give it to me for 12 mo, but they didn't :P
16:54 +Tomis: more mass transit
16:54  LzrdKing: WOO camera's here!
16:54 +Tomis: *sigh*
16:55  zer0her0: Tomis: agreed
16:56 +Tomis: what? who agreed with me, why would you do that, WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU
16:56 * Tomis eyes zer0her0 suspiciously
16:56  zer0her0: mwahahahaha
16:56  zer0her0: oooh nothing tomis
17:03  zer0her0: Tomis: i'm all for more mass transit
17:07  diamonds: so I'm connected to work VPN
17:08  diamonds: I'm having trouble connecting to a website that they are connecting to fine, so I want to route web traffic over the VPN
17:08  diamonds: http://i.imgur.com/9TraG.png
17:09  diamonds: clicked ok>apply, but none of my connections have been interrupted (irc, streaming audio etc.)
17:09  diamonds: basically it's clear it didn't work
17:09  diamonds: what am I doing wrong?
17:10 +Tomis: try putting the VPN entry at the top of the list?
17:10 +Tomis: i'm not familiar with VPN, but i know it uses the network devices in the prefered order
17:10  diamonds: Tomis: what list? the network pref pane list?
17:10  diamonds: can't seem to reorder there
17:10 +Tomis: yea, click the gear, "set prefered order"
17:11 +Tomis: it's named something like that
17:11 +Tomis: ah, "set service order" is it
17:11 +Tomis: and then click apply of course
17:12 +Tomis: note that it may jsut be ignoring the VPN for current connections
17:12  diamonds: ok seemed to work!
17:12 +Tomis: it may use it once you go to establish new connections
17:13  diamonds: shoot my traceroute to the site is still failing :/
17:13 +Tomis: that's how networking works in OS X, if a new device pops up higher in the list, existing connections aren't immediately killed
17:13  diamonds: Tomis oh they were I think
17:13  diamonds: I didn't disconnect myself from IRC
17:18  Dink: hmm, I had entires in my /etc/hosts file and after a reboot it disappears any ideas ?
17:23 +Tomis: the actual file disappears?
17:24  jeremyw: There is a configuration to make OS X not overwrite your /etc/hosts file.
17:27 +Tomis: i wouldn't expect it to rewrite it on reboot anyway
17:28  js_: i never experienced that
17:28  jeremyw: I thought there was some configuration where this would happen.  I remember it happening to me.
17:30  gh0stz: how can I strip color codes on the Terminal
17:31  gh0stz: i have green text I want to match in a shell script but I can't because the text is green and I don' tknow how to strip it 
17:31  jeremyw: gh0stz: export CLICOLOR=0
17:31  jeremyw: That will turn off color all together.  Is this what you mean?
17:31  gh0stz: no...i want color...i just want to strip it for this one piece of text so that I can do a comparison
17:32  gh0stz: so I am using git and want to write a post-checkout hook that only does something if it changes to a specific branch
17:32  gh0stz: however I have git colors turned on too
17:32  gh0stz: so it returns the branch name in green
17:32  jeremyw: Well, the regex to do such a thing is simple.  As for git, you can disable color on a per command way.
17:32  gh0stz: oh...i was unaware you could disable color in git per command
17:32  gh0stz: however I am much more interested in learning the regex to strip color codes
17:32 --- diamonds is now known as diamonds|afk
17:32  gh0stz: I have one I use in linux with sed
17:33  gh0stz: however the version of sed that comes with os x doesn't have -r
17:33  jeremyw: Also, since it's in a hook, you could just change the config, run your command and then reset the config back to where it's at.
17:33  gh0stz: so i wasn't sure without using extended regex
17:33  gh0stz: yea...that was my thought
17:33  jeremyw: Let me get you a command...hold up.
17:33  gh0stz: i just was having a hard time finding it
17:33  gh0stz: thanks man
17:34  jeremyw: git branch --no-color
17:34  jeremyw: Next time, just "git help branch"
17:34  jeremyw: It's in the man page and the help output.
17:34  jeremyw: ;)
17:35  gh0stz: aw...yea my bad...i knew that...just was meaning the regex to strip colors in general
17:35  gh0stz: but yea...thanks
17:35  gh0stz: i was just hoping to add the ability to strip text of color on the fly from my utility scripts I keep loaded from my profile
17:35  gh0stz: but yea that will work for this case
17:36  jeremyw: gh0stz: Well, git has that flag for many/most/all? commands that use color by default.
17:36  gh0stz: yea...
17:36  gh0stz: i was just meaning whether it was using git or not
17:37  gh0stz: but I appreciate it
17:38  gh0stz: thanks! :)...i will just go with this for now
17:39  jeremyw: gh0stz: Well, since this is scripted you can use that CLICOLOR variable.  Set it to no color at the script start.
17:39  gh0stz: true
17:39  gh0stz: that one was new to me
17:40  jeremyw: Since this script will not affect the environment outside the script, you could do this.
17:40  gh0stz: thanks again
17:40  jeremyw: np
17:40  gh0stz: just export CLICOLOR=0...then it will go back to the environment setting at the end of execution, right?
17:42  jeremyw: gh0stz: Yes.  These hooks will not modify the outside environment so setting that at the beginning of the script will be safe.
17:43  gh0stz: right...got ya...thanks again
17:45  jeremyw: gh0stz: Thanks for being a pleasure to work with.  We don't see a lot of intelligent conversations here.
17:45  torchie: ;o
17:46  gh0stz: lol...i don't know if I would consider that intelligent but thanks...considering i've been using bash for years...i kinda feel like a dumbass for asking ;)

18:22  diffract|: any suggestions on permanent deletion of files on osx?
18:22 +Tomis: drag to trash, empty trash
18:23  diffract|: that's not permanent
18:23  jeremyw: It can be, secure delete.
18:23 +Tomis: secure empty trash
18:23 +Tomis: finder menu>secure empty trash
18:23 +Tomis: it does a 7 pass write or something silly like that
18:24  diffract|: aha.. never knew that existed
18:24 +Tomis: a once over rewrite of the data is more than enough
18:25  diffract|: i guess it's sometimes not enough on magnetic drives
18:38  S_SubZero: once is enough.
18:40  topriddy: hi friends
18:41  topriddy: kind of wondering how i'll take screen shots of apps running on a virtual box on a mac os x host...ie the right key combinations
18:42  S_SubZero: using the guest's screen shot function
18:51 +Tomis: search help menu in any app for "screenshot" topriddy 
18:51  topriddy: S_SubZero: okay
18:51 +Tomis: top hit should be the system's help entry on screenshot shortcuts
18:52 +Tomis: additionally, your VM of choice may have a menu item for taking a screenshot of the VM
18:52  topriddy: oracle/sun virtual box
18:53 +Tomis: look through the menus, and the documentation/help
18:53  topriddy: okay
18:53 +Tomis: the help menu search also searches through all menus in the menubar as well
18:53  jeremyw: I thought VirtualBox had built-in feature to take a screenshot of the guest.
18:55  diffract|: i take focus away from the VM window and use osx's screenshot keys
18:56  S_SubZero: Grab the window, that would work yes?
19:02 +Tomis: that would include the window controls (titlebar etc) and he window shadow
19:02 +Tomis: not ideal if you just want a picture of the VM's screen
19:08  gxl: Is "Icon?" the file that contains a folder's thumbnail?
19:08  gxl: I'm migrating to a unix server and the network users like their icons a lot.
19:16 +Tomis: yea folder icons are stored in a weird invisble file named Icon with a carriage return in the name before or after it
19:16 +Tomis: can't remember not
19:16 +Tomis: *now
19:24  gxl: I think it's after it
19:24  gxl: It is a strange way of doing this.
19:35  gxl: Is there a way to copy files from finder to a network share and have it skip erroneous files (names) instead of stopping?
19:36 +Tomis: nope
19:36 +Tomis: finder is pretty finnicky that way
19:37  gxl: I'll probably need to fetch them from the new server then. Great linux tools to fetch and skip/continue with errors.
19:39  gxl: I'm retiring an osx server. It's become problematic and a sore spot because of the lack of availability of drives now.
19:40  kensanata: I've started identifying faces in iPhoto using "Find Faces" – is there a keyboard shortcut to help me delete/ignore faces so that they will not keep popping up again and again?
19:46  Necrosan: dropping eggs?
19:46 +Tomis: there's a few shortcuts there for speeding up the process of identigying faces
19:46  evilbug: yo, Necrosan.
19:46 +Tomis: try searching the help menu kensanata 
19:46  Necrosan: hi evilbug
19:46 +Tomis: there may be a help document outlining it all
19:47  kensanata: Tomis: I found the help section where they explain how I can name them, or confirm suggestions, but no keyboard shortcuts. And on the help page listing the keyboard shortcuts I don't see anything appropriate.
19:48 +Tomis: you can do things like bulk selection, hold a modifier to do bulk YES and bulk NO
19:48 +Tomis: it's been a while since i used it
19:48 +Tomis: mayb want to try searching macosxhints.com
19:51  kensanata: Tomis: Hm, I think what you're referring to is the suggested images for a particular person. When looking at the corkboard, however, there's a "Find Faces" button at the bottom that will show you two or three pictures, asking you to name them. It's what I have to do as a new iPhoto 11 user… :)

20:54  crankharder: what is "location"
20:54  crankharder: obviously something like 
20:55 +Tomis: like when you take the laptop home from the office

21:47  iRath96: Hey, I was wondering if its possible
21:47  iRath96: To make Mac use SOCKS5 Proxies only for certain Programs.
21:47 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 76 seconds
21:47  iRath96: My OS: Mac OS X 10.6.4
21:48  iRath96: Actually I want it to use a SOCKS Proxy for every Process except Terminal
21:49 +Tomis: it's an all or nohing affair
21:49 @crilly: http://cl.ly/0M1s3M0C0s2e1U3c3i0B
21:50 +Tomis: you can define the type of traffic to route through proxy of course
21:50 @crilly: You can bypass the proxy for certain hosts etc
21:51  iRath96: Well, I know that
21:51  iRath96: Well, perhaps you might get the Idea when I explain what I want to do:
21:51 @crilly: well now you know again
21:51  iRath96: I want to write a SOCKS5 Server in PHP...
21:52  iRath96: And now the Problem is:
21:52  iRath96: Its running on Terminal
21:52  iRath96: That means
21:52  iRath96: My Applications connect to localhost:some Port
21:52  iRath96: And then PHP recieves the Connection...
21:52  iRath96: Connects to the requested Server
21:52  iRath96: And is connected to itself
21:52  iRath96: As its affected by the Proxy aswell
21:53  iRath96: The Problem is: I'd therefore need a 2nd Computer
21:53  iRath96: Because otherwise I get a Recursion
21:53  iRath96: And i dont have a 2nd computer...
21:53  KeeperOfTheSoul: or you just need to tell PHP not to use the proxy
21:54  iRath96: Hmmm, thats possible?
21:54  KeeperOfTheSoul: though no idea how you do that
21:54  iRath96: Oh
21:54  iRath96: Well, thats the problem :s
21:54  KeeperOfTheSoul: probably, I know how to do it for .Net running in windows
21:54 @crilly: What about PHP running in a VM?
21:54  dikdik: is this book any good: http://i.imgur.com/UnQLW.jpg
21:55 @crilly: lol
21:55  iRath96: Hmmm, I dont like VMs
21:55 @crilly: yes I met my girlfriend using that book
21:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: crilly: should be nicer solutions than that though
21:55  iRath96: They just require to many Resources
21:55 @crilly: KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah
21:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: I did see someone mention that PHP curl uses the standard proxy environment variable

22:09  iRath96: I want to setup one on my localhost.
22:09  iRath96: So that I can edit my traffic
22:09 @crilly: I'm thinking you want to modify the packet headers to spoof your IP :P
22:09  iRath96: No...
22:09  iRath96: I want to be able to edit packets generally
22:10  iRath96: Well, I already thought of a concept
22:10  iRath96: But the only problem is the recursion
22:10  iRath96: That PHP would connect to itself causing it to connect to itself and again and again and so on
22:11 @crilly: It's an interesting one and to be honest, we've answered the OS X part of it. I think you need help with the PHP setup side of things now :)
22:11  iRath96: Well, the Problem is
22:11  iRath96: That the SOCKS5
22:11 @crilly: But please feel to continue hunting an answer here.
22:11  iRath96: Is System Wide
22:12  iRath96: Every Application is affected
22:12 +Tomis: so use antoher machine for the proxy
22:12 +Tomis: done and done
22:12  iRath96: Well, I dont have another machine
22:12 +Tomis: oh well
22:12 @crilly: Yeah that's the simplest approach. SQUID or something.
22:12 +Tomis: yea SQUID can run a local proxy server jsut fine
22:13 @crilly: No I meant fried with some sauce.
22:14  iRath96: Well, I actually want to affect every Socket
22:14  iRath96: Not just HTTP and HTTPs
22:14 +Tomis: why in bejesus do you want to do this again?
22:14 @crilly: I thought SQUID could handle anything?
22:14 +Tomis: what are you filtering?
22:15 @crilly: everything
22:15 +Tomis: for what sort of traffic
22:15  iRath96: All Traffic.
22:15 @crilly: He wants to examine every packet to make sure none of them contain any of his personal classified secret personal files.
22:15 +Tomis: um
22:15 +Tomis: yea how are you gonna do that
22:16 +Tomis: there's this great program called Little Snitch, it's made for people who haven't received medication for their paraoia
22:16  iRath96: No, its about editing Packets.
22:16  iRath96: Not filtering Connections...
22:16 +Tomis: how are you going to do that exactly
22:17 @crilly: Tomis: lol
22:17  iRath96: Well, this isnt the Problem
22:17 +Tomis: no, it is though
22:17  iRath96: The Problem is when I do it
22:17 +Tomis: because you don't know wtf you're talking about
22:17  iRath96: I would have a Recursion
22:17 --- crilly has changed the topic to: Welcome to ##mac! | Channel rules: Play nice, no hackintosh & English only | Register @ http://ircmac.com/ | DIY @ http://iFixIt.com | <+Tomis> there's this great program called Little Snitch, it's made for people who haven't received medication for their paraoia
22:17 +Tomis: you can't just magically edit any packet from any protocol
22:17 @crilly: well actually you can
22:17 +Tomis: that's going to flat out break down
22:17 @crilly: If you know what you're doing
22:18 +Tomis: programs are going to bork at the corrupted data
22:18 @crilly: like i said, if you know what you're doing
22:18 +Tomis: he doesn't though
22:18 @crilly: you'd modify the CRC flag in the frame/packet etc
22:18 @crilly: to be correct given the modifications. 
22:18  iRath96: I do.
22:18 +Tomis: anything that does field length checking
22:18 +Tomis: or hashes the contents of the data
22:18 +Tomis: it's going to break all over the place
22:19 @crilly: Tomis: You can't assume he doesn't know what he's talking about when manipulating packets/frames because he hasn't discussed that yet.
22:19 +Tomis: yes i can
22:19 +Tomis: i already did
22:19 @crilly: Well that makes you a big silly head person
22:19 +Tomis: thusly proving your hypothesis that i can't, to be wrong
22:20  iRath96: All I want to do is:
22:20  iRath96: 1. Write a SOCKS5 Server in PHP
22:20 @crilly: Banning you makes me right and increases the size of my penis. Bare this in mind.
22:20  iRath96: 2. Redirect Traffic to it
22:20  iRath96: And the rest is up to me
22:20  iRath96: As I am then able to modify Packets
22:20  iRath96: But the Problem is
22:20  iRath96: That these Connections
22:20  iRath96: For example to www.google.com
22:20  iRath96: Will then go to the Proxy Server
22:20  iRath96: And the Proxy Server
22:20 @crilly: I wonder if you used two proxies you could bypass the recursion?
22:20  iRath96: Will try to connect to www.google.com
22:20  iRath96: And it will be redirected to itself
22:21  iRath96: As all Applications are affected
22:21  iRath96: And so PHP is aswell
22:21 +Tomis: loo kat squid iRath96 
22:21 +Tomis: it has no problem with this
22:21  iRath96: Causing it to be unable to connect to www.google.com
22:21  iRath96: Which makes a Proxy Server impossible.
22:21  iRath96: What I want to do is a little similar to Tor
22:21  Saul_Goodman: oh god
22:21 +Tomis: lawls
22:21  iRath96: Where you have kind of a Proxy Server running on localhost aswell
22:21 +Tomis: ha ha
22:21 +Tomis: that was awesome
22:22 +Tomis: that's all he needed to know, and he left
22:23 @crilly: :P
22:23 @crilly: I think he seen you in here, actually.
22:24  iRath96: All I need to know is how to disable a SOCKS Proxy for a certain Application ...
22:25 @crilly: Sorry, I don't know.
22:25 +Tomis: just look into how existing oslutions like squid do it iRath96 
22:25 @crilly: And Tomis knows nothing, so...
22:25 +Tomis: i've run a local caching proxy before, it worked fine
22:26  iRath96: This is - yet again - not what I want.
22:26  iRath96: All I actually want is disable a Proxy for a certain Application.
22:26 @crilly: Is there an advantage to that? I really do need some server here to play on.
22:26 +Tomis: ah huh
22:27 +Tomis: in a lan, yes, for just machine i don't see much benifit to it crilly 
22:27 +Tomis: *just one machine
22:27 @crilly: For testing stuff and learning how-to get stuff done
22:27 +Tomis: i was running it for my whole lan, pretty nice actually, like soft software updates, update one machine, then when you run the updates on other machines it's pulling it from the cache instead of re-downloading
22:28 +Tomis: would be nice if the time capsule or airport extreme w/ disk attached could do that
22:28  iRath96: Is it really that hard to disable a Proxy for a certain Application?
22:29 @crilly: Tomis: I didn't know Apple offered that? How do you set it up?
22:29 +Tomis: firefox ignores the proxy settings just fine it would seam iRath96 
22:29 +Tomis: so apparently not
22:29 +Tomis: i said it *would* be nice crilly 
22:29 +Tomis: heh
22:29 @crilly: You also said you did it
22:29  iRath96: Well, still, Firefox isnt my Problem, my problem is PHP.
22:29  iRath96: I have to make PHP ignore the Proxy
22:30 +Tomis: http://macupdate.com/app/mac/11737/squidman is what i used i think crilly 
22:31 +Tomis: as i remember, had to do some configuring to get it proxy connections from outside the computer, upped the cache size, and was good to go
22:32  iRath96: Is there really no way to do it?

22:51  Ibuki: is that new now???
22:51  Ibuki: no copy and paste?
22:52  Ibuki: this is a waste, might as well use my windows 7 partition and use the new microsoft ofice 2010 for windows...its better
22:52 @crilly: iWork.
22:53  Ibuki: too expensive
22:53  Ibuki: and complicated
22:54 @crilly: Expensive? I got it for £30.00
22:54 @crilly: And it's very easy.
22:54 +Tomis: iWork is cheeper than office
22:55 +LaraX: and Google Docs is free
22:55 +Tomis: oh he left, jsut wanted to rant i guess
22:55 +LaraX: oh yeah
22:56 +LaraX: I tried iWork's trial once and didn
22:56 +LaraX: 't really like it
22:57 +Tomis: i like it
22:57 +Tomis: cheeper than office, native app, has what i need
22:57  torchie: iworks is awesome until you save
22:57 +LaraX: I just wanted a simple text editor so Google Docs' old version is ok (the new version is too much like a word processor)
22:57  torchie: or rather export
22:57  torchie: new google docs doesn't have hanging indent
22:57  torchie: outta my face!
22:57 +LaraX: don't know what that is but the new version might have it. you can use either
22:58  torchie: don't think any of them has it
22:58  torchie: has haved
22:58  torchie: has havededed
22:58 +LaraX: have you tried the updated one?
22:58 +Tomis: first version of pages was a page layout app
22:58 +Tomis: then they added a word-like mode because that's what everyone really wanted it to be
23:01 +LaraX: it's not perfect, has some bugs and thinks lacking. it's just ok
23:01 +LaraX: things*
23:08  tmx1: when installing OSX 10.6 over an older 10.3 etc, does it automatically wipe the main OS partition? or just upgrade?
23:09 +Tomis: you can't instal 10.6 over 10.3
23:09  tmx1: well i stuck the dvd (10.6) in this older mac pro because the new video card replacement caused a kernel panic and the thing wouldnt boot anymore
23:10  tmx1: i think it was 10.3 or possibly newer
23:10  tmx1: not sure
23:10 +Tomis: i mean 10.3 was on PPC macs only
23:10  RichardLynch: Since OS X *has* no real /dev/shm, for testing purposes, for a unit test, just to use the right path, I created a plain old normal directory with mkdir /dev/shm and then some sub-directories.  Set up permissions and ownership correctly with sudo.  Then I went to create a file in there, and it says "Operation not supported"  Hunh?  Like even a shell "sudo touch /dev/shm/cache/a/6/a6f59d88fb2d13083744a6ca09d590bd" says that.  What's 
23:10  RichardLynch: with that?
23:10  tmx1: ah
23:10 +Tomis: it's probably 10.4
23:10  tmx1: probably right
23:10 +Tomis: yea, you can upgrade it tmx1 
23:10  tmx1: hmm didnt give me any option to upgrade when i booted with the 10.6 CD
23:10  tmx1: just said install
23:11 +Tomis: yup
23:11  tmx1: so it will still have the original software from 10.4 then?
23:11  tmx1: still usable?
23:11 +Tomis: the way the 10.6 instal process works is to remove the old OS, and keep users and preferences etc. intact
23:11  tmx1: even like the old adobe software?
23:11  tmx1: thats the most important there
23:12  tmx1: adobe and mac office etc
23:12 +Tomis: depends on what OS version the adobe suit was targetted against
23:12 +Tomis: if it supported 10.5 then i'd expect it to run fine on 10.6
23:12  tmx1: it was Adobe CS3
23:13 +Tomis: but who knows, adobe likes to make finnicky crap
23:13  tmx1: 1st time today to do any work on a MAC
23:13  tmx1: i almos lost it when i had to google how to open the DVD tray
23:13  tmx1: almost
23:13  tmx1: and then press C to initiate boot process
23:14 +Tomis: heh
23:14  tmx1: id still like to know why it had a shit like that
23:15  tmx1: put in a new video card, and it wont boot
23:15 +Tomis: well, that could have something to do with it
23:15 +Tomis: and what happened when you take the card out
23:15  tmx1: the 1900XT had been recalled and i got an 8800GT instead

23:21  tmx1: anyways, 10.6 is installing on it as we speak
23:22  LordDragon: be careful about where you get the 8800gt too
23:22  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  the 8800gt was happy with 10.5 here. 
23:22  tmx1: it was an authorized mac dealer store
23:23  LordDragon: i ordered mine from ebay, only to find out it was a PC card that was reflashed to work with mac. ive never had a problem with it, but still it irks me that its not an official mac card
23:23  Velociraptors: (bought it in November 2008)
23:23 +Tomis: you save $100 LordDragon !
23:24  tmx1: u guys got OSX to work on VMWARE successfully?
23:24  LordDragon: Velociraptors, ah ok. maybe its just my 10.5 disc is old. i think its 10.5.0 and i guess the disc doesnt have 8800gt drivers installed on the 10.5.0 disc
23:24  Velociraptors: tmx1:  aye
23:24  tmx1: i failed
23:24  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  ahh - that'd be it, yeah. 
23:24  tmx1: i even tried the tutorials
23:24  LordDragon: Tomis, yeah but it also technically means i have a hackintosh. and that irks me :(
23:24  tmx1: the most i got out of it, is endless boot cycle
23:24 +Tomis: no it doesn't LordDragon 
23:25  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  OUT! IMPOSTOR!
23:25  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i knowwwwww :( its so sad and irks me to no end
23:25  tmx1: omg!
23:25  tmx1: suicide now
23:25  tmx1: lol
23:25 +Tomis: it's the same exact card, just that it orginalyl shipped with different firmware than it has now
23:25 +Tomis: no big deal
23:25  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  if that makes your mac a hackintosh, then my 3.3GHz 8-core is a hackintosh
23:26  LordDragon: Velociraptors, how so? you have a reflashed pc vid card too?
23:26  Velociraptors: nah. overclocked with a little firmware messing.
23:27  Velociraptors: just as unlikely to make it a hackintosh as yours :)
23:27  Dink: Hello i am having problems with AFP. Both mac are connected to the same WLAN. One one I have enabled file sharing and have shared a directory. On the other when I type in aftp://IP of the mac it says it can't connect. Any ideas ?
23:28  Dink: afp:// *
23:28  LordDragon: Velociraptors, wow 3.3ghz. thats pretty sweet. i wonder how much i could safely overclock my 2.0ghz xeons
23:29  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  I kinda lie though - the util that allowed overclocking them doesn't work on SL
23:29 +Tomis: you should see the other mac in he sidebar in finder Dink 
23:29 +Tomis: or in the Network list, Finder>Go>Network
23:29 +Tomis: try connecting from there

23:36  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  same heatsinks, slightly different thermal compound - yours uses a traditional grease, the 8-cores use a liquid metal alloy

23:37  Velociraptors: at a guess, I'd say there's no chance of an update for ours
23:38  Velociraptors: cos a 64-bit only version of osx, I suspect, is sooo far in the future we'll be long obsolete
23:38 +Branes: There won't be a 64-bit-only OSX. 10.7 will be 32 & 64 bit, and it's the last of the big cats.
23:38 @crilly: 10.6 is 32- & 64-bit
23:38  LordDragon: Velociraptors, yeah your prob right. if there is a chance, its a low one. how much ram you got in your rig? 16GB ?
23:38 +Branes: iOS Desktop, on the other hand, will go 64-bit only in 2014.
