21:33 * danl reacts to LaraX's poke
21:34  LaraX: danl: so I saw your link, you think I shouldn't get it then or it might be fixed in a software update like it's saying? and does it apply to all of them?
21:34  LaraX: the refresh probably won't be for a while
21:34  danl: I honestly don't know. I'd imagine they will either fix it with a software update, or replace the defective units.
21:35  danl: And I don't think it is all of them
21:35  LaraX: Branes: what do you think about this? http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/04/apple-confirms-macbook-air-bugs-internally/
21:35  LaraX: danl: ok
21:36  danl: Ima crawl back into bed now, just happen to glimpse at teh computer while meandering to the restroom :)
21:36  danl: night LaraX
21:36  LaraX: good night danl
21:45  MariusAZ: :)
21:45  MariusAZ: Success
21:46  aL3x: hey
21:46  aL3x: MariusAZ: 
21:46  MariusAZ: :)
21:46  aL3x: i have an ipod touch now :D
21:46  MariusAZ: go into the other channel
21:47  aL3x: which other channel?
21:47  MariusAZ: The new one
21:51  torchie: idop tchou
21:56  aL3x: rorx and lara sitting in a tree...
21:59  Branes: LaraX: Aye, the Air display hiccup is something I found out about this morning. Makes sense. I personally think the new Airs were rather rushed.
21:59  Branes: The fact that there's a growing number of Air 11's coming back inside of a week being completely dead is not reassuring.
22:04  falcom: ouch
22:05  falcom: what's the problem with the new Airs?

22:17  Branes: falcom: http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/04/apple-confirms-macbook-air-bugs-internally/ <-that got leaked earlier
22:18  falcom: ahh i see, fortunately that's not a hardware issue 
22:18  Branes: falcom: plus there could be something wrong with the semi-custom C2D processor Apple are using in it. Its too early to tell.
22:20  Branes: On the informal GSX death-by-ubuntu machine list, there's now an even dozen new Airs; seems there's a much higher chance of a very early death if you try to run an unsupported OS. Whether this ties into the other OSX-only Airs also becoming totally dead within a week, we still don't know. Too early to tell.
