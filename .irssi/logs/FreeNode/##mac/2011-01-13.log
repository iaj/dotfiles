03:45  cryptics_: Steve973: what OS are we talking about?
03:46  Steve973: cryptics_: the server is linux
03:46  yxz97: hey, is truth that Apple is going to create a kind of apple store but for the Mac?
03:46  cryptics_: well.. samba/netatalk/nfs...
03:46  Steve973: cryptics_: I am attempting to use an nfs export, but I cannot seem to get write permissions when I mount it on the mac
03:46  cryptics_: Steve973: ah uid/gid the same? seem to remember issues witht hat
03:47  Steve973: cryptics_: doubtful that they're the same
03:47  Steve973: does smb have this same problem?
03:49  cryptics_: Steve973: have a look through this http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/nfs.htm
03:49  cryptics_: been a while since i used nfs. samba has other issues mainly on the mac side with finder
03:49  cryptics_: not huge issues just finder locking up from time to time etc
03:50  cryptics_: though if you through a winbox into the mix samba is the best choice
03:52  Steve973: i will be using windows to mount it, but it's windows 7, which allegedly has nfs support, cryptics_

04:25  Steve973: cryptics_ i got everything working, but I would like this mount to show up on the desktop.  How can I do that?
04:26  Steve973: or if anyone else cares to answer.  it's an NFS mount
04:26  cryptics_: um just go into finder connect to server cmd+K then enter nfs://ip:/share then once mounted drag the mounted share into login items
04:27  Steve973: ok but I specify the share in disk utility.  does your info still apply, cryptics_ ?
04:27  cryptics_: disk utility?
04:27  cryptics_: what are you talking about?
04:28  Steve973: Applications / Utilities / Disk Utility / File / NFS Mounts...
04:28  cryptics_: um no you don't need that at all
04:28  cryptics_: cmd+k from the finder
04:29  Steve973: ok then it's showing under "Shared"
04:30  Steve973: But it's not showing on the desktop or in Devices.
04:31  cryptics_: umount whatever you did via the diskutility replacement for fstab and then just use cmd+k
04:31  Steve973: cryptics_: as such, I cannot drag it in Login Items in the Accounts preferences pane
04:31  Steve973: cryptics_ did that.
04:31  cryptics_: is it on the dekstop?
04:31  Steve973: no
04:31  cryptics_: then you are doing something wrong
04:32  Steve973: I will reboot and then retry.  
04:32  cryptics_: dont need to reboot
04:32  cryptics_: open terminal and type: mount
04:32  cryptics_: see what is mounted
04:33  Steve973: ok i made sure all of the nfs stuff is unmounted.  I'll try again.
04:34  Steve973: it mounted in /Volumes but nothing on the desktop.
04:34  Steve973: i'm using Snow Leopard
04:37  cryptics_: hrm check finder prefs that the network mounts are shown on desktop?
04:37  cryptics_: it's off by default
04:38  Steve973: There it is! thanks
04:38  neverblue: you trying to offer network shares on your local mac ?
04:38  Steve973: yeah, trying to mount network shares on my mac
04:39  neverblue: win shares ?
04:39  Steve973: nfs
04:39  neverblue: im attempting the same thing here
04:39  neverblue: i have added them into /Volumes
04:39  neverblue: using mount_smbfs
04:39  Steve973: ok, so that's different than nfs
04:39  neverblue: now I want to keep them persistent, after restarts/reboots
04:40  neverblue: well, NFS is a funny system too
04:40  neverblue: compared to smb
04:40  cryptics_: arg just use finder
04:40  Steve973: I'm still having permissions issues though...
04:40  neverblue: finder doesn't do it
04:40  cryptics_: then drag the mounted share icon from the desktop into login items in sys prefs accounts
04:40  neverblue: it will open a Finder instance for each share, on logon
04:41  Steve973: I'll be back.  let me attempt a reboot and see what happens.
04:41  cryptics_: well if you know better surely you know how to script auto mounts
04:41  Steve973: thanks cryptics_ 
04:41  Steve973: i'll work on permissions next 
04:41  cryptics_: np

06:28  LSD`: you don't install X from either of those, they're rigged to use the X server Apple provide as part of OS X. If you didn't installed when you first installed OS X though, I'm not sure how you install it after the fact...
06:28  rryouumaa: oh, hmm.  i do remember i installed some x code thingie from online at one point.  that won't do it?
06:29  rryouumaa: or xcode perhaps
06:29  rryouumaa: if not then i guess i can't use x
06:30  LSD`: XCode is just the development tools, I don't *think* they include X11.app. Apple may have it up for download through the Developer Connection, but I can't say for sure

13:07  blue_sky: command+tab have stopped working. I googled and someone suggested killing the dock - which should come back on it's own. Now I've no dock and still no command+tab, anyone know how to cure this?
13:07  Tomis: log out and/or reboot blue_sky 
13:08  blue_sky: Tomis: was hoping to avoid that, I'm busy here!
13:08  Tomis: chucking caches and repairing permissions periodically couldn't hurt while you're at it
13:08  Tomis: when system services break down that badly, it's best to just log out, restart ideally
13:10  blue_sky: yeah, looks like I have to, it's a real PITA, I get this about once a week.
13:10  strehlow: has chmod +x dock.restart worked?
13:11  strehlow: just to get you going again until you have time to restart?
13:11  Tomis: time to repair permissions and possibly do a systme reinstal blue_sky 
13:11  Tomis: if you have any system hacks, try uninstaling those first
13:12  blue_sky: strehlow: where is dock.restart for me to chmod it?
13:13  blue_sky: Tomis: no way I'm doing a re-install unless it's completely borked. It's set up right, too many apps etc. I'd dnever get it right again - this isn't windows you know!
13:13  Tomis: it's borked, reinstal it
13:13  Tomis: you on 10.6?
13:13  blue_sky: 10.5.8
13:13  Tomis: it does a reinstal in place, it swaps out the system, leaves users and settings intact
13:14  Tomis: ah, under 10.5 you have to do an archive & instal to get that functionality from the installer
13:15  blue_sky: OK ISWYM, that would be a better option. I going for the repair permissions... after a reboot
13:15  Tomis: yea, before all that i'd go looking for system hacks to remove, caches to delete, etc.
13:17  blue_sky: Tomis: I avoid system hacks, I don't want to cause breakage, but caches, yeah I can live with the loss of those
13:17  Tomis: do a search for "SIMBL", with the option to "include system files"
13:18  Tomis: you may be running hacks without even knowing it
13:18  Tomis: also look in the ScriptingAdditions folders in the Library folders
13:18  blue_sky: that "SIMBL" is that in file names or within files?
13:18  Tomis: it's the file name
13:26  blue_sky: Found a SIMBL.pkg under /Library/Receipts, looking into that I find that it doesn't do anything unless you load some other utility, it just provides hooks.
13:26  blue_sky: I don't appear to have anything that needs it, but it's there all the same, so maybe it's not helping

16:36  diamonds: like, option+??? then type your character?
16:36  roe: I'd love it if it was ported to ObjC...it wouldn't run slow as molasses anymore
16:36  roe: s/was/were
16:36  Tomis: there's no general shortcut for that as far as i know diamonds 
16:36  diamonds: Tomis: ty
16:43  MrUnagi: Tomis: tmobile sucks
16:44  Tomis: they all do MrUnagi 
16:45  MrUnagi: you do
16:45  MrUnagi: =)
16:46  MrUnagi: i <3 you Tomis 
17:01  booginga: hey guys im trying to set a wordpress site up on my mac. Just one issue. when i put localhost in the mysql databse host in the config file there is an error but if i put 127.0.0.1 in there then everything works fine
17:02  booginga: i checked the hosts file and localhost is in there
17:02  booginga: is there something that im missing about mac routing
17:02  Tomis: localhost is 127.0.01
17:02  Tomis: so it should work
17:02  booginga: yeah thats what i thought
17:44  tehbaut: is it normal for USB device to not fit all the way inside the USB ports on Macs?
17:45 --- simplicity-- is now known as simplicity-
17:45  S_SubZero: on my MacBook Pro, the charging cable for my iPhone fits nearly flush against the case.
17:46  tehbaut: how about other non-Apple USB cables/devices?
17:47  simplicity-: I don't think that's normal. All my USB devices fit with 1-3mm space at max.
17:47  S_SubZero: i just plugged my blackberry USB cable in and it fits nearly flush against the case.
17:47  pgpkeys: can anyone recommend a better convert than Video Converter? I've a bunch of avi files (camera movies of my neices and stuff) that I'm trying to convert to mpeg4 movies so I can make a DVD I can play on a set top dvd player. (Trying to make a collage of movies for my sister) but video converter just sits there saying its 100% complete but never stops processing the end of the movie. So it keeps giving me the pause or stop button for the conversion ...
17:47  pgpkeys: ... but never actually finishes the conversion (or the UI is never notified of the end of the conversion and never goes on to the next one)
17:48  tehbaut: so far, several USB devices I have don't fit all the way... there's always about 1-2mm of exposed metal
17:48  tehbaut: it's really a pet peeve... especially since I have OCD :(
17:48  S_SubZero: my USB stick does not get particularly flush.  But the metal part looks obviously long.
17:49  MrUnagi: pgebhard: handbrake?
17:49 +zer0her0: ffmpeg ftw
17:49  pgebhard: MrUnagi: ?
17:49  MrUnagi: !
17:49 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: um you do know that a DVD player only plays MPEG2 right?
17:50  pgpkeys: zer0her0: yeah but I ahve a couple otehr things I want to do with the videos and mpeg4 is perfect
17:50 +zer0her0: then your statement made no sense
17:50  MrUnagi: so I can make a DVD I can play on a set top dvd player
17:51 +zer0her0: standard set top DVD player can only play MPEG-2 or MPEG-1
17:52  pgpkeys: no, because if I convert to mpeg4 (which I need for other thigns as well) most dvd creation software will take mpeg4 and convert to mpeg2 with no problems. but going from avi to mpeg anything is not so easy
17:52  MrUnagi: handbrake
17:52  pgpkeys: thanks mrunagi 
17:53 +zer0her0: haha, um my statement is still correct
17:53 +zer0her0: plus your throwing out data by doing that
17:53 +zer0her0: but whatever
17:53  pgpkeys: well ok, then i'll come at this from a different way. what (besides handbrake) will take avi and allow me to convert to mpeg anything?
17:54  pgpkeys: video converter seems to be a bit buggy, doing exactly what I described as the problem
17:54 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: ffmpeg
17:55  pgpkeys: doesn't hadbrake call out TO ffmeg?
17:55  pgpkeys: err hand
17:56 +zer0her0: don't think so, handbrake was originally written for a platform that didn't have ffmpeg
17:56  pgpkeys: ah
17:57 +zer0her0: actually i lied
17:57 +zer0her0: looks to be using hooks into ffmpeg
17:57 +zer0her0: i'd still try ffmpeg on it's own
17:58  pgpkeys: ok grabbing both at the mment actually
18:01  tehbaut: weird... my USB devices fit snuggly in the left-side USB port of my MBA does (I just tested again, but thought it was the same issue on the left... apparently that's not the case)
18:02  tehbaut: so there's something odd about the right-side USB port that's keeping the plugs from going in most of the way
18:02  MrUnagi: tehbaut: maybe it is just yours
18:04  tehbaut: MrUnagi, not so sure about that since this is a unibody
18:04  MrUnagi: what does that matter....
18:05  tehbaut: wait, no I see there's some separation between the body and the internal part of the port... at first glance it did look part of the body though
18:05  tehbaut: if that were the case, that would mean that all units would have been the same
18:06 +zer0her0: tehbaut: i'll check tonight
18:06 +zer0her0: left side you say isn't flush?
18:07  tehbaut: zer0her0, right side
18:07 +zer0her0: right side got it
18:07  tehbaut: zer0her0, left side is nearly flush... not quite, but much snugger
18:08 +zer0her0: got it, new air?
18:08  pgpkeys: nice. ffmpeg looks like its working so far. next to check out handbrake as well (downloaded already)
18:08  pgpkeys: thanks mrunagi and zer0her0 . I should be able to feed the resulatant mpeg-2 to iDVD correct?
18:08  tehbaut: zer0her0, yep... I've got the 11.6" model
18:08  tehbaut: in the right side, the USB plug can wiggle and wobble... not so much an issue on the left side though
18:08 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: i don't use iDVD sorry.
18:09 +zer0her0: tehbaut: gotcha i'll check both models tonight
18:09  pgpkeys: what do you use to make home video DVDs?
18:09 +zer0her0: (we have both at my teaching gig)
18:09 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: i don't make home dvd's
18:09  tehbaut: zer0her0, cool... I'm usually around, so just ping me or PM
18:09 +zer0her0: i only make them for work
18:09  pgpkeys: ok what do you use for work?
18:09 +zer0her0: home video all goes on youtube
18:09 +zer0her0: dvd studio pro, or burn.app
18:09  pgpkeys: do they play in regular dvd set top sets?
18:09 +zer0her0: tehbaut: will do
18:10  tehbaut: thanks :)
18:10 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: yep, that's what we use on the museum floor
18:10  pgpkeys: ok
18:10  pgpkeys: will google those
18:10 +zer0her0: though we're converting to solid state players
18:10 +zer0her0: so i output both dvds and h.264 videos now

19:09  BenyHex: bonsoir
19:09  simplicity-: Hello.
19:10  BenyHex: is there anyone here who speak french
19:10  BenyHex: ?
19:10  simplicity-: There might be.
19:11  BenyHex: it's because i'm not very good in english and i'm looking for help, i'll try in english please be indulgent :)
19:11  simplicity-: Sure no worries, go ahead.
19:12  BenyHex: i'm selling my Imac G5 and i wanna erase everything on it to sell it without any data except snow leopard and the base of the system
19:12  BenyHex: i already looked in internet but it doesn't work
19:12  simplicity-: Well, on a G5 you can't install Snow Leopard.
19:13  simplicity-: Snow Leopard requires an Intel CPU.
19:13  BenyHex: this is a intel cpu and snow is already install
19:13  simplicity-: Okay.
19:13  BenyHex: maybe this is the model just after the G5 so
19:13  BenyHex: but i'm sure it's an Intel cpu
19:13  BenyHex: :)
19:14  simplicity-: Well, then just insert your CD and hit C in the startup. You should then go to the Disk Utility and format your HDD (overwrite with 0s if you wanna be 111% sure) then install SL again.
19:15  BenyHex: ok because i reboot it and it started on the cd but then when i install SL it doesn't ask if i wanna overwrite or not, i'll try hiting C at the beginning
19:15  BenyHex: thank you :)
19:15  simplicity-: oh
19:15  simplicity-: well you'll need to find Disk Utility, it's in the menu bar somewhere.
19:16  BenyHex: yes and i choose my boot disc then i hit on partitionner but i can't do anything then
19:17  simplicity-: Sounds weird, never had any problems with that. Someone else might be able to help you then.
19:18  BenyHex: i'll try the first solution you gave me because i boot on the cd but without hiting C so i'll try boot while hiting C maybe the menu will be different :)
19:20  BenyHex: i'll reboot the mac so i've to quit, thanks for helping :) see ya
19:29  booginga: hey guys was asking about this before but haven't figured it out yet. Im trying to install a wp-siste locally on my mac everything is working with the exception of one thing. when i put the mysql host in the wp-config.php file to localhost it has an error connecting but if i use 127.0.0.1 then it works. I looked at my hosts file everything seems to be inplace anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening?
19:30  booginga: does mysql not look at the host file? that does not make sense but im just stummped
19:38  Angostura: Sorry mate, I tend to use MAMP rather than the inbuilt and I've noticed no such problem
