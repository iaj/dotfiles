00:19  bonez2046: I have tried adding the print in System Preferences | Print & Fax but if I attempt to print to that printer it says it's busy, but it's not busy.. 
00:20  MariusAZ: That would most likely be a spooler problem on the Ubuntu machine
00:21  alteregoa: and?
00:21  alteregoa: configure ubuntu for printer sharing
00:21  alteregoa: whats the driver?
00:21  alteregoa: HP?
00:22  MariusAZ: No clue
00:22  alteregoa: the brand?
00:33  bonez2046: alteregoa: well, yeah it would be an HP printer driver.. but isn't the driver installed on the client machine? 
00:33  bonez2046: the printer is hp laserjet iii p ..

03:37  b3ny0-: I haven't used any casing since I got it
03:37  torchie: and if you sounded the train horn wrong one of the kittens gets a little too frisky
03:37  torchie: then just don't sound the train horn wrong

04:07  Tomis: select it in terminal, hit command-c, heh
04:07  heycam: Tomis, not quite the solution i'm looking for :)
04:07 @ChrisAM: what are you looking to do?
04:07 @ChrisAM: I've never used xclip.
04:08  heycam: i have a command that will generate some text on stdout, and i want to put that text ont he clipboard
04:08  heycam: you can do something like `ls | xclip -` and that will place the output of ls on the clipboard
04:08 @ChrisAM: ah
04:08  heycam: (on linux/x at least)
04:08 @ChrisAM: heycam ... pbcopy

06:54  salamandyr: got a weird problem.. looking at a google calendar via Safari or Calendar on my ipad.. items are late by 1 hour in the Calendar synch.
06:59  salamandyr: actually, all the calendars on my ipad are late, even the ones synching from ical on my mac.
06:59  salamandyr: late by 1 hr.. any ideas?
06:59  MariusAZ: Daylight savings time
06:59  salamandyr: this has been going on for a couple weeks :)
07:00  MariusAZ: Yeah, I had the same problem, I had to turn on Timezone support for both iCal and the idevices and set it to my city
07:00  MariusAZ: Seemed to fix it
07:01  salamandyr: where do you turn on timezone support for the device?
07:01  salamandyr: it shows my correct timezone in ipad prefs...
07:03  salamandyr: it did start happening when i traveled to a diff time zone.. seems the ipad forgot where i am
07:04  MariusAZ: huh
07:04  MariusAZ: Yeah my phone did that last week when I went to Colorado
07:04  MariusAZ: Took like a day for the time to go back 
07:04  salamandyr: yup, i went from CA to CO.
07:04  salamandyr: but that was several weeks ago
07:04  salamandyr: when i came back it was messed up
07:05  ayaz: From what I have been hearing, and this is something I've neither test nor experience myself, the clock application is not able to or will not recognize the end of DST. I am not sure whether that could be related in any way.
07:05  salamandyr: ah ha, found it.  Calendar has a diff time zone pref than the device itself.  
07:06  MariusAZ: Yeah
07:06  salamandyr: naw, DST just started
07:06  MariusAZ: That's where I set it and it seemed to fix it
07:06  salamandyr: but i fixed it - just didn't expect to have to set the time zone two places on the device

07:21  omg|its|otr: So my macbook (2,1) doesn't seem to want to connect to my router via wifi, but has no problem connecting to my nexus one when it's in portable hotspot mode.
07:21  omg|its|otr: No other computers (windows laptop, iMac, Nexus One) have any trouble connecting to my router (it's unencrytped). Any idea what might be causing this issue?
07:22  Richie086: do you get any sort of error or does it just not work>
07:22  Richie086: ?
07:22  Richie086: does ur macbook see the router at all?
07:23  omg|its|otr: Yeah, it sees it. when I try to connect dmesg gives
07:23  omg|its|otr: AirPort: Link Down on en1. Reason 1 (Unspecified).
07:23  Richie086: hmm
07:23  omg|its|otr: Which is a vastly unhelpful error.
07:24  Richie086: lol
07:24  Richie086: yeah apple is great at error messages that dont make a whole lot of sense
07:24  MariusAZ: omg|its|otr:  Under location, delete all of them other than Automatic
07:24  MariusAZ: And see if that fixes
07:24  Richie086: has it always been an issue or is this like, today it stopped working
07:24  Richie086: yeah
07:24  Richie086: good idea
07:25  omg|its|otr: you'll have to excuse my ignorance, I'm used to Linux not OSX. Where am I finding "Location"?
07:25  omg|its|otr: This is Snow Leopard, btw
07:26  omg|its|otr: oh
07:26  omg|its|otr: Location.
07:26  omg|its|otr: I see that.
07:26  omg|its|otr: Yeah, there's no location in there besides automatic, so that's not it
07:27  Richie086: has it always been an issue or is this like, today it stopped working?
07:27  MariusAZ: dang
07:27  omg|its|otr: Today.

07:28  omg|its|otr: No.
07:28  Richie086: ah
07:28  Richie086: hmmmmmmmm
07:29  omg|its|otr: I was under Linux, to hopefully get some useful error messages - but I got nothing other than "authentication timed out"
07:29  Richie086: have you tried hooking it up to a wired connection to see if that works?  
07:29  omg|its|otr: I don't have the option to go wired.
07:30  Richie086: strange it should not even be trying to authenticate, you said no encryption
07:31  omg|its|otr: This is true, which is another thing that annoyed me.
07:31  Richie086: what type of router u got?
07:31  Richie086: just wondering

07:33  Richie086: one guy with ur exact router
07:34  Richie086: one thing to try to see if it is a problem with ur user account for some dumb reason, or if this is a system wide issue is create a test user, login with user see if your still having issue..  
07:36  Richie086: i am guessing he is reading that posting

07:46  Richie086: oh windows is having issues connecting?

07:57  Richie086: so windows is having issues u say?
07:57  omg|its|otr: Yeah.
07:57  omg|its|otr: I want to say that this is hardware related, but then I don't get it.
07:57  omg|its|otr: If my wireless card isn't working, it should not working with all devices.
07:57  omg|its|otr: But it works with my nexus but not my router.
08:00  Branes: There isn't a fix; the wifi chip in your 2,1 is one of the first draft-N chips and can't be updated
08:01  Branes: There were three not-quite-completely-compatible versions of draft-N on the market for almost a year
08:01  omg|its|otr: That doesn't make sense to me.
08:01  omg|its|otr: Because it was working 100% before today.
08:01  omg|its|otr: I get that it might be an incompatible N device, but it worked fine until about 6 hours ago
08:01  Richie086: yeah that right there is a strange one
08:02  netdaemon: recent software update?
08:02  Branes: Something's confused it - tried power-cycling the machine, and resetting the SMC?
08:02  omg|its|otr: resetting the smc I have not.
08:02 * omg|its|otr goes ahead and does that
08:07  omg|its|otr: This was not the fix I was searching for :(
08:09  Richie086: hmm?
08:11  omg|its|otr: no difference
08:14  Richie086: the fact that windows is ALSO not able to connect makes it seem like its ur router
08:15  Richie086: what machine are u using to chat with us?  is it hardwired?  going thru ur nexus?
08:15  omg|its|otr: Except that windows on DIFFERENT hardware can conneect to the router.
08:15  omg|its|otr: Yeah, I'm chatting on my macbook via nexus
08:16  Richie086: oh
08:16  Richie086: so do u have windows installed on ur macbook as well?  is that the windows that was having issues?
08:16  omg|its|otr: This is where it would be nice to not be poor
08:17  omg|its|otr: I could just buy a bunch of new hardware, problem solved xD
08:17  Richie086: hehe
08:17  Richie086: yeah you should work on that
08:17  omg|its|otr: Yeah, here's the setup of my house:
08:17  omg|its|otr: Macbook can run OSX, Windows, Linux.
08:17  omg|its|otr: None of which can connect to the router, but all of which can connect to nexus.
08:17  omg|its|otr: Thinkpad w/ windows, that can connect to router fine.
08:17  omg|its|otr: iMac with tiger that can connect to router fine.
08:18  omg|its|otr: Nexus that can connect to router fine =\
08:18  Richie086: wtf
08:18  Richie086: i know what your problem is
08:19  omg|its|otr: do share
08:19  Richie086: ghosts... internet ghosts...  yep..  your equipment is haunted..  
08:19  omg|its|otr: GENIUS!!!1
08:19  Richie086: not the answer u wanted 
08:19  Richie086: now, does ur nexus hand out dhcp or is it just a AP that gets dhcp from ur router?
08:20  omg|its|otr: I think my macbook is just spiting me for the abuse it recieved.
08:20  omg|its|otr: it does dhcp
08:20  Richie086: OK, and does ur router hand out dhcp too?
08:21  omg|its|otr: And it gets it's interbutts from 3g, not from the router.
08:21  omg|its|otr: Yeah, router does dhcp
08:21  Richie086: but u said the nexus can connect to the router right?
08:21  omg|its|otr: indeed
08:22  Richie086: now, when i say dhcp, i mean it hands out 192.168.x.x not gets a dynamic external ip, does the nexus hand out private ip addresses?
08:22  Richie086: u know what i mean?
08:23  omg|its|otr: yeah, I know what you mean, and they both hand out dhcp.
08:23  omg|its|otr: My nexus acts as a fully functional router.
08:23  Richie086: Ok, are both devices having out the same DHCP scope (say 192.168.x.x)?
08:23  omg|its|otr: I... don't know.
08:23 * omg|its|otr checks
08:24  omg|its|otr: nah, router is 192.168.0.x and nexus is 192.168.43.x
08:24  Richie086: damnit
08:25  Richie086: what happens if u turn off ur nexus completley, so it cant be accessed, and then try to connnect to ur router
08:25  Richie086: other than the fact that u wont be able to talk with us
08:25  Richie086: lol
08:25  omg|its|otr: Nothing.
08:25  omg|its|otr: It just won't connect to my router.
08:25  Richie086: im out of ideas
08:26  omg|its|otr: lol, welcome to the boat.
08:26  Richie086: i was hoping there was some kind of conflict with dhcp
08:26  omg|its|otr: But that would be logical.
08:26  Richie086: yeah
08:26  Richie086: fuck that
08:26  omg|its|otr: And my computer doesn't give me any of that.
08:26  Richie086: yeah that would be far too easy
08:28  boink: I installed curl with the developer tools on the installation cd. After that I installed the latest version with make && make install, but the newest version doesnt show up when i do curl --version, what am I doing wrong?
08:28  Richie086: are there any open wifi access points near you (bars, coffee shops, resturants, fast food places)
08:29  omg|its|otr: Richie086: lol, have I not mentioned that my macbook doesn't have a screen?
08:29  Richie086: omfg
08:29  Richie086: no 
08:29  Richie086: that does make it a lot easier tho
08:30  omg|its|otr: Oh. Well it doesn't. Gotta keep it rooted to a monitor at all times
08:30  Richie086: just bring a monitor, a power strip, a video cable, 
08:30  Richie086: no biggie
08:30  Richie086: find a power source
08:30  omg|its|otr: Heh.
08:30  omg|its|otr: Honestly my macbook is the most epic thing ever
08:31  Richie086: let me guess, you cracked the screen and its all fucked up and not useable?
08:31  omg|its|otr: Hinge, actually.
08:31  Richie086: oh
08:31  omg|its|otr: And it's not that it's not useable.
08:31  omg|its|otr: It's that it's not there.
08:31  omg|its|otr: There is no top half of my macbook
08:32  Richie086: damn!
08:32  Richie086: thats hardcore

08:39  omg|its|otr: took each key off and spray painted it. Colours look hideous in that picture though :(
08:40  Richie086: yeah they do
08:40  omg|its|otr: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_bMv6s3exfzQ/S7emYdU-1JI/AAAAAAAAACg/8eP-rq9_Vz8/s1600/keyboard2.jpg there's a better picture from a year or two back.
08:40  omg|its|otr: back when I still had a screen xD
08:40  Richie086: yeah the colors are better
08:41  Richie086: ok i can see why u would say that ur macbook is responding to all of the abuse
08:41  omg|its|otr: xD
08:41  omg|its|otr: The battery lasts about 45 min from full charge.
08:41  omg|its|otr: The thing's pretty decrepid.
08:41  Richie086: yeah
08:42  Richie086: brb smoke
08:49  ja660k: hey all, is there a way i can press the next track, pause/play, nect track without my screensaver stopping

12:52  topriddy: hi mac friends
12:55  Angostura: hi
12:57  topriddy: so am still catching up/learning how to use a mac...got a newbie question...i am downloading a non-resumable download file...
12:58  topriddy: i want to lock my computer while i go out for lunch but want the download to continue
12:59  Psixerces: activate the screensaver, but set the "require password on resume from sleep/screensaver" option in the security preference pane
13:00  topriddy: Psixerces: should i also set the auto log out timer to the duration of my lunch??? so the downloader sees my system has on and still continues the download
13:00  Psixerces: don't worry about logging out..
13:00  Psixerces: just set your screensaver to a screen corner, with a 1 min grace period
13:00  Psixerces: and set the setting in your security prefpane
13:01  Psixerces: you stay logged in, and your download keeps going
13:04  topriddy: Psixerces: thanks, but sorry....if my system goes on stand-by or something, my internet modem auto matically goes off
13:05  Psixerces: then change your energy saving timeout to 2 hours while on power, and screensaver to 10 mins
13:05  Psixerces: but manually start the screensaver via either a screen corner, or via the keychain menu
13:06  topriddy: Psixerces: i did the power thing already, thanks you have been helpful
13:08  topriddy: Psixerces: a short display sleep time shouldnt affect any ongoing work like computer sleep would right?
13:09  Psixerces: nope
13:10  Angostura: I'm never quite sure whether Mac energy saving is smart enough to know to not sleep during download activity.
13:11  Angostura: I suspect it won't sleep, but have never performed a proper test
14:06  bint: hi there
14:06  bint: i have an external drive which i wanna use on both, mac and windows
14:06  CyberdogX: hi there
14:06  bint: someone told me that ntfs works fine with fuse, http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-2.X/
14:06  bint: anyone got experience with it?
14:08  MrUnagi: Bint....ntfs-3g
14:08  MrUnagi: Or.fat if u dont need large files
14:08  bint: i need large files.. thats the thing
14:09  MrUnagi: Then ntfs-3g or fuse
14:09  bint: aright
14:09  bint: did you try one of em?
14:09  bint: or even both
14:09  MrUnagi: I think I am currently using fuse....but I have used 3g.....i have no need for it
14:10  MrUnagi: Windows sucks lol
14:10  bint: why?
14:10  bint: so after install one of these apps, my mac is able to read/write nfts or do i have to access the harddisk via this software?
14:10  MrUnagi: Viruses...horrible driver implementation...slows down over time....ui is too processor rich
14:11  MrUnagi: Crashes, blue screen errors, horrible legacy support
14:11  Tsavo: back slashes
14:11  bint: well win7 is quiet ok
14:11  bint: i like it
14:11  MrUnagi: so you like viruses
14:11  bint: nah
14:11  MrUnagi: Malware spyware etc etc
14:12  MrUnagi: With 3g and I think fuse it is a driver.....you can write to the drive......os x can read the drive already wi thout those
14:12  bint: yep
14:13  bint: but i dont have to use a spec. GUI to access the drive..
14:13  bint: its just a driver then :) thats nice
14:13  bint: so i'll give it a try
14:13  bint: thanks
14:13  MrUnagi: I dropped windows 2 years ago
14:13  MrUnagi: I have no need for it
14:17 --- kateweb_ is now known as kateweb
14:29  bint: oh and what filesystem should i use if i only need it on mac osX
14:29  bint: there is Extended Journaled
14:29  bint: just extended etc
14:35  boink: ewff
14:35  boink: fd
14:35  boink: sd
14:35  boink: f
14:35  boink: fss
14:46  ayaz: bint: Everything else considered, a file-system with journaling support is better than one without journaling support, as it is able at the very least to deal with file-system corruption in the event of a system crash much better. 
15:15  boink: I installed curl together with the developer tools on the installation cd. Now that I want to have the latest curl I download it, and install with make && make install but I still get the old version when I use curl --version. What am I doing wrong?
15:18  vvsh: hi, i accidentally execute this command "mv stuff .../" in terminal, now where is my stuff?
15:18  alteregoa: scroll up
15:18  alteregoa: and look where you moved it to
15:19  vvsh: its not in the directory above
15:19  vvsh: or the current directory
15:19  alteregoa: its in root 
15:19  alteregoa: type cd /
15:19  alteregoa: and ls
15:19  alteregoa: or get snoper commander
15:19  vvsh: its not in the root /
15:19  alteregoa: yeah then its in halleluyah
15:20  vvsh: alteregoa: what do you mean?
15:21  vvsh: i'm thinking to do a " find / -name "stuff" 
15:21  vvsh: but its going to take forever 
15:21  ayaz: vvsh: Did that "mv" command really work for you? It should've given out an error when it was executed. 
15:22  vvsh: ayaz: it works, no errors
15:23  ayaz: vvsh: I see. Then what does running the command "ls -al .../" give you?
15:23  vvsh: got it now, from the output of find command, its actually in the current directory with name ..., because directory name with . is hidden, so its hidden directory
15:24  vvsh: ayaz: thanks

18:41  jeremyw: MAMP is it's name I think.
18:41  jeremyw: I can't remember...I never needed such a tool since OS X comes with Apache and PHP already installed/configured.
18:41  omg|its|otr: *SIGH*
18:41  jeremyw: Installing MySQL is simple.  Boom.
18:42  jeremyw: converge: If you need it: http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html
18:42  converge: jeremyw, tks =)
18:43  omg|its|otr: So, I'm back still with my problem: My macbook won't connect to my router's wifi or direct via ethernet to my modem. Both pieces of hardware work as every other device in my home connects to them fine. But my macbook's hardware isn't destroyed because it can connect to my nexus one (acting as a router) just fine
18:44  jeremyw: Macs don't come with some special nics.
18:48  jeremyw: omg|its|otr: Macs don't have special NICs.  You should be able to plug in an ethernet cable and get an IP if your router/gateway does DHCP and is configured to have leases available.
18:49  jeremyw: omg|its|otr: Same for WiFi, if you can see the network and the router/gateway does DHCP, and has leases available with either no MAC filtering or MAC filtering that has your MAC address available.
18:50  Angostura: converge: Yup MAMP it is, and it's very nice
18:50  jeremyw: Looks like your router isn't working as well as you think.
18:51  Angostura: omg|its|otr: Is this cable modem connectivity?
18:52  Angostura: and are you sure the router/modem aren;t set up to only accept connections from certain MAC addresses or something?
18:53  omg|its|otr: router I am sure.
18:53  omg|its|otr: Modem, I am not.
18:53  omg|its|otr: So I just plugged in my router, and then plugged my computer into the router.
18:53  omg|its|otr: See if we can get a con that way
18:54  omg|its|otr: yeah, still not getting anything
18:54  Tu13es: does it get a link?
18:54  Tu13es: a hardware link
18:55  overtherainbow: ...
18:55  overtherainbow: no way
18:55  overtherainbow: It was a range issue.
18:55  Tu13es: ..ethernet?
18:55  overtherainbow: No, the wifi.
18:56  overtherainbow: I was in here for about 7 hours over the past two days troubleshooting with people.
18:56  overtherainbow: And none of us could figure out why every device could connect to the router except my macbook.
18:56  overtherainbow: Well apparently the card in my macbook just stopped transmitting with any sort of power in the last day or so, because it can't see the router when it's 1 floor away, but everything else can
18:57  overtherainbow: Still doesn't explain why my ethernet doesn't work though

20:05  Angostura: ErrantEgo: The first thing to check is the cabke
20:05  Angostura: cable
20:06  Angostura: ... and the connection with the iPod Touch
20:07  Angostura: ErrantEgo: Once you have done that, we can take it from there
20:11  ErrantEgo: Angostura: the cable is fine..i can plug it into my other mac as well as my PC, and it works just fine
20:12  Angostura: ErrantEgo: Good stuff 
20:12  ErrantEgo: Angostura: obviously it doesnt sync up, but it *will* charge the battery
20:12  Angostura: and if you plug it in, does anything show up in System Profiler?
20:12  ErrantEgo: dunno
20:13  Angostura: Well, get to it man
20:13  ErrantEgo: sorry, had to finish my OJ and put the glass somewhere else
20:13  ErrantEgo: i almost spilled it :x
20:13  Angostura: I quite understand :-)
20:14  ErrantEgo: i THINK so
20:14  ErrantEgo: its showing my keyboard
20:15  ErrantEgo: as well as somethin by the name of "M4848"
20:16  Angostura: But not showing an iPd Touch?
20:16  Angostura: with that name?
20:16  ErrantEgo: its showing "logitech" as the manufacturer of that
20:16  ErrantEgo: and correct, no iPod touch
20:16  Angostura: OK.
20:16  ErrantEgo: i just wonder what the hell "logitech" is
20:16  Angostura: And you've tried restarting the Mac?
20:16  alteregoa: cq dx
20:16  ErrantEgo: nothing else is connected to it :p

20:17  alteregoa: yeah i had to do that, i didn't find the route key
20:17  ErrantEgo: Angostura: i can re-restart it
20:18  alteregoa: there are a plenty of fine ham radio apps for linux, and they work with osx
20:18  alteregoa: is there something like a "repository" to add some linux stuff with mac?
20:18  Angostura: ErrantEgo: As a matter of interest, if you move the iPod to another port (say, the keyboard USB port, if you have one) does the location of the Logitech move in System Profiler
20:19  ErrantEgo: Angostura: actually, ive got it plugged into the USB port on my keyboard
20:19  Angostura: alteregoa: I'm not an expert, but Google MacPorts
20:19  ErrantEgo: cause i had to move it to my laptop so i could charge it
20:19  alteregoa: thanks
20:19  Angostura: ErrantEgo: OK, so pop it into another port
20:19  Angostura: on the main machine
20:19  ErrantEgo: done
20:19  Angostura: then bring up/efresh profiler again
20:20  ErrantEgo: ok
20:20  Angostura: Did anything move?
20:20  ErrantEgo: it IS seeing the iPod under "USB High-Speed Bus"

20:27  ErrantEgo: huh?
20:28  Angostura: You said you couldn't restart the machine
20:28  ErrantEgo: i never said that
20:28  converge: im trying to change folder permissios for apache access, how could i do it ? i tried chown nobody.admin folder/ -R
20:28  ErrantEgo: i said i restarted it yesterday :P
20:28  Angostura: Oh.... weird
20:28  Angostura: You said you "can" haha
20:28  Angostura: whoops
20:29  Angostura: Before mucking about any more, I would try a restart
20:29  ErrantEgo: ok
20:30  Angostura: If it is still not working after that, I'd probably try making a fresh account and see if iTunes spots it in there
20:30  ErrantEgo: ohhh i really dont wanna go that route
20:31  ErrantEgo: it was a bitch to get it to work from the beginning :P
20:31  Angostura: ErrantEgo: Just a test, nothing more
20:32  Angostura: What was the issue getting to work in the first place?
20:32  ErrantEgo: just within iTunes
20:32  ErrantEgo: for some reason it wouldnt talk to it or something
20:32  ErrantEgo: i cant remember
20:33  ErrantEgo: nothing
20:34  ErrantEgo: wtf
20:35  ErrantEgo: and this time its not seeing it
20:36  ErrantEgo: hm wait a sec

20:36  ErrantEgo: ok what the hel...
20:36  ErrantEgo: hell*
20:36  ErrantEgo: i unplug the cable, and plug it back in, and itunes opened
20:36  ErrantEgo: and its syncing now
20:37  ErrantEgo: ok im confused heh

20:38  ErrantEgo: Angostura: ok, i give rofl
20:38  ErrantEgo: Angostura: its seeing it fine now
20:38  ErrantEgo: heh
20:38  Angostura: after the restart?
20:38  converge: atmosx, do you know what should i use, "verify disk permissions" or "repair disk permissions?"
20:39  ErrantEgo: and this is a mac! ROFL
20:39  ErrantEgo: macs arent supposed to behave like this :P
20:39  Angostura: "Turn it off and back on again" You know it makes sense
20:39  ErrantEgo: Angostura: yeah, it initially didnt see it
20:39  atmosx: converge: repair
20:39  ErrantEgo: Angostura: i unplugged and replugged the USB into the iPod
20:39  ErrantEgo: Angostura: and it seen it, opened iTunes, and sync'ed
20:39  atmosx: it's quite self-explainatory :-P
20:39  Angostura: Could simply be a bit of gunk in the connector
20:40  ErrantEgo: Angostura: the restart seemed to work
20:40 * ErrantEgo shrugs
20:40  ErrantEgo: Angostura: well, idk
20:40  Angostura: Even the best machines get confused sometimes
20:40  ErrantEgo: i tried moving it between the back of the computer, my USB hub, as well as my keyboard
20:40  ErrantEgo: nothing happened
20:40  Angostura: restarts are wonderful thinks
20:40  ErrantEgo: thats when i plugged it into my other mac and my PC
20:40  Angostura: ... no the gunk quite often gets into the iPod slot
20:40  ErrantEgo: and even though it told me it couldnt sync (cause of obvious reasons)
20:41  ErrantEgo: it was charging it
20:41  ErrantEgo: so i knew the cable or iPod itself wasnt trashed/whatever
20:41  Angostura: It can charge even if it won't sync
20:41  Angostura: just takes one pin to be a bit dirty
20:41  ErrantEgo: the account is on my mac mini
20:41  ErrantEgo: it wouldnt see it or nothing on there
20:41  ErrantEgo: ive got a B&W G3
20:41  ErrantEgo: i plugged it into there

21:41  alteregoa: looks like it compiles the entire kernel tree
21:41  alteregoa: those amarok need a shitton of dependencies
21:41  JeffATL: have been looking at carbon copy cloner and am unsure about restoring to bare metal  from an image file on a firewire drive - is the idea to just perform a new os x 10.6 install on the new drive, install CCC, and use it  to restore from the image file?
21:42  zer0her0: remote: if you don't have the original CDs you can call apple and they'll send you a copy of the OS that came w/ the machine for cost of media and shipping
21:45  remote: zer0her0: cool thanks
21:45  GoaSkin: remote: Apple ships AFAIK all computers with OSX - even to customers and resellers. Some dealer may ship them with pre-installed Linux but they don't get the computers from Apple without Mac OS

21:54  GoaSkin: ah... MorphOS exists since 10 years but they sold less than 1.000 licenses
21:54  MariusAZ: That's not surprising
21:54  GoaSkin: but amazing that there comes a new OS that runs on my old quicksilver
21:55  MariusAZ: If they would have created it as an open source project and charged for support/media it probably would have been more successful
