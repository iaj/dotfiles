03:20  FriedBob: Or do you mean disk space used by a dir?
03:20  Tu13es: i assume he means disk space, in which case I'd say use Disk Inventory X
03:20  hvgotcodes: FriedBob: I mean how to tell how much the files are using, by directory
03:20  hvgotcodes: yes disk space

06:30  Al2O3: Marvolo: that is correct, no 64 bit tiger, nor will there ever be.  Snow Leopard is not 100% 64 bit either, and likely will never be.

08:03  Bensawsome: totic well you could do mini-dvi to dvi to rca
08:04  totic: hehe, I guess that is a solution, thanks
08:04  Bensawsome: i think a dvi to rca converter exists atleast
08:04  Bensawsome: i know it is a bit annoying but it usually works
08:05  totic: Bensawsome: according to something I just read they display-port doesnt have an analog signal
08:06  Bensawsome: well i think they use converters
08:07  Bensawsome: also vga/dvi to rca connecters cost like... 50 bucks if i remember
08:08  Bensawsome: hmmm
08:08  Bensawsome: mebe im wrong
08:08  Bensawsome: i mean idk much about the rca converters :/
08:08  totic: what is the name of the connector?

11:26  dirkson: Hallo all. Is this the correct channel for linux on mac hardware, or am I barking up the wrong tree?
11:27  S_SubZero: it's a general Mac channel so fire away.
11:29  Branes: That depends on how you want to run linux. Directly on the hardware is a bad idea.
11:29  dirkson: Using whatever the latest debian kernel is, my usb transfer speeds are ungodly slow over one usb port, (equal to usb 1) and the other usb port  is simply non-functional. Any suggestions for fixing this?
11:29  Branes: Yes; put your debian inside a VM with OSX as the host OS.
11:30  Branes: Don't make the mistake of assuming that just because it has an Intel processor means it is fully compliant with generic-class PC hardware. Apple's is slightly but annoyingly custom.
11:31  dirkson: Branes: That would involve using OSX at some point. I am OSX retarded. I am amazing on linux, vaguely competent on windows, but put me on MacOS and it's like I've never used anything electronic before in my life. Took me 45 minutes to connect to wifi.
11:32  Branes: Nevertheless, the answer remains the same. Either put it in a VM with OSX as the host OS, or sell the Mac to someone who can use OSX.
11:32  bassliner: dirkson: i pretty much doubt you know how to actually use a linux system if it takes you 45 minutes to connect to wifi on a mac.
11:32  bassliner: dirkson: no offense.
11:32  dirkson: bassliner: People pay me to do server administration. I figure I'm ok.
11:32  S_SubZero: heck, the wifi connects right at the welcome screen on first install.
11:33  LSD`: bassliner: 45 minutes is hwne you use the "proper linux" methid of connection. That is, sitting at a terminal with iwlist, iwconfig and whatnot XD
11:33  Branes: ... which is totally the wrong approach.
11:33  bassliner: dirkson: then i wonder if you ever have been administrating under pressure of time.
11:33  dirkson: LSD`: Hell, on a linux variant I'm familiar with, I can connect to wifi on the command line in only a few minutes.
11:33  dirkson: bassliner: Yes, why?
11:33  bassliner: LSD`: the linux command line tools are okay. tho doing wpa2 with them is a pain.
11:34  bassliner: dirkson: well what kind of wifi was it? some enterprisey stuff with radius authentication or something?
11:34  LSD`: bassliner: hence why, for all their faults, tools like Network Manager are a god send, but the hardliners want everyone to do things the hard way because that's how they learned to do things
11:35  dirkson: Branes: But anyway, your answer is still less than useful. At one point both usb ports /did/ function at full capacity under linux. But the kernel switched when I told debian to do an update, and my graphical problems vanished.... but I started noticing slow usb problems, and thus I am here.
11:35  bassliner: LSD`: i don't think it's just because they learned that way but rather because they feel they have control over things.
11:35  dirkson: bassliner: WPA2. The wpa2 password dialog was /not/ where I expected it to be.
11:35  Branes: dirkson: I know plenty of upper-echelon IT admins with decades of experience who love using OSX *as is*, and using VMs to run a config locally and/or use standard terminal facilities to access remote systems.
11:35  bassliner: dirkson: interesting. never had problems connecting a mac to wifi, and i use wpa2 as long as i can remember back.
11:36  Branes: dirkson: Running an unsupported OS *directly* on Apple hardware will lead to catastrophic CPU failure. You do not hae much of a choice in that matter.
11:36  LSD`: bassliner: that may be what they say and believe, but underneath they hate the idea that newbies get an easier time of it than they did so go out of their way to preserve the old ways
11:36  Branes: That explains the sad addiction to the commandline, LSD :)
11:36  dirkson: Branes: Umm... When does that happen? This thing's been chugging along for years at this point. I've just never needed the usb ports much.
11:37  bassliner: sad addiction you say? if i can do something on the command line, there's a 99% chance i won't do the same via a gui.
11:37  dirkson: bassliner: Like I said, I'm macOS retarded. Anything else I can use ok. *Shrugs* Thus why my first action upon receiving a macbook as a gift was to install linux on it : )
11:37  bassliner: and if there's one thing i hate about macs it's that i can't move/resize/maximize windows without having to move my right hand away from the keyboard (which i can under fluxbox)
11:38  bassliner: dirkson: interesting...
11:38  LSD`: Branes: Unlike you though, I'm not completely against the idea of the CLI, just being force to use it in situations a GUI can be more convenient. OS X gives me the best of both worlds, which puts it miles ahead of any Linux distro
11:38  S_SubZero: Macs are designed for soccer moms.  Not knowing how to use a Mac is like not knowing how to write your name.
11:38  Branes: I *like* it :)
11:39  bassliner: S_SubZero: that's absolutely correct but that's also the reason i will never be able to use a mac as quick as i am on my fully customized linux box at work.
11:40  bassliner: and i love being quick, at least when it comes to computers.
11:40  S_SubZero: well like the wifi thing.. I'm not sure how overcomplex you're trying to make it.  I know that after the Mac is taken out of the box and turned on, it boots to a welcome screen.  Not far into this, it turns on the wifi and looks for a network.  It then asks for the password if needed.  Then it connects.  Boom.  Done.
11:41  Branes: He didn't give it the chance, Sub.
11:41  LSD`: bassliner: I find I'm quicker for the most part in Mac or Windows since I'm not forever dealing with issues in basic desktop stuff
11:42  S_SubZero: Some Macs use Broadcom wifi, like mine.  I know linux loves (ie. hates) Broadcom wifi so much.
11:56  bassliner: LSD`: well i love my fluxbox desktop under linux, but it's pretty much a configuration that grew over the past 10 years with custom themes, custom config files and such. and all themes don't use any graphics whatsoever and not even antialiased fonts.
11:57  LSD`: ugh
11:57  bassliner: LSD`: mostly when i'm confrontated with a "current" linux desktop like a current ubuntu desktop i'm short of killing someone. it seems unfinished and unusable to me by all means and it's visually inconsistent.
11:58  remyo: What are the hardcopy.0, hardcopy.1, etc files used for in ~/ 
11:58  LSD`: bassliner: given that you use and like fluxbox, you have no right to make claims like that XD
11:58  bassliner: LSD`: and the bugs and cavearts i get with gnome i try to deal with since more than 3 years and yes i reported bugs and nothing changed - even worse, some new cavearts appeared and such.
11:59  bassliner: LSD`: uhm what? :)
13:02  MikeH: Hi guys

16:38  Tu13es: can i boot from an ipod touch? lol
16:38  zer0her0: FriedBob: lata, get me some food
16:38  zer0her0: and then cook it for me
16:38  zer0her0: :-D
16:38  cosmicfoo: zer0her0: no one tried.. as far as i know
16:38  zer0her0: Tu13es: you used to be able to boot from an iPod(did it for years as an emergency diag tool)
16:38  Tu13es: zer0her0: yeah, naturally my ipod video and usb HDD are both at work.
16:38  Tu13es: and the USB HDDs i have here I can't repartition
16:39  bassliner: basically the thing about paying for apps is that it is anything but fair that ppl who simply have more money have less or no need to be illegal just to get the stuff they need to do their work on a computer. i feel that someone making an application like ableton live or propellerheads reason should get money for it as it really deserves it and those are great products and i'm willing to pay for them. but it is anything but fair that a top manager has to ...
16:39  bassliner: ... pay the same amount of money for the same app than someone being unemployed.
16:39  Tu13es: so basically, you want communism?
16:39  bassliner: anarchy. not communism.
16:39  Tu13es: lol.
16:40  zer0her0: Tu13es: doh
16:40  zer0her0: bassliner: may i ask how old you are?
16:40  bassliner: zer0her0: i'm 30 years old.
16:41  zer0her0: same here
16:41  zer0her0: (30 as well)
16:41  TheNumb: o0 
16:41  bassliner: zer0her0: and i'm working as a unix system administrator so i'm used to bsd licenses or the gpl, so maybe that's why i keep challenging things like paying for software.
16:42  zer0her0: bsd license and gpl, free software they do not make. ;)
16:42  FriedBob: zer0her0: Whatcha want? I'll need the cost of the food + $15 in advance.
16:42  Leedsman: I've always believed that someone should get paid for their work, if they're skilled at it. Whether you're a coder, mechanic, or writer. You can choose to give, but you have to be able to support your family at some point, and that is generally by charging for your product or services.
16:42  zer0her0: FriedBob: hehe, sweet. that would be awesome. sadly i'm not hungry haha.
16:42  zer0her0: Leedsman: hear hear!
16:43  FriedBob: Leedsman: i agree, but I also try not to pay for software if I can help it. But that's mostly because I have so many other demands for my money.
16:44  bassliner: Leedsman: that's completely true. but on the other side i feel that an operating system i use should be accessible in the form of source code, changeable for anyone and for any needs, free (like in freedom) and free (as in free beer).
16:44  FriedBob: Even when I buy games for my 360, I buy used so I can spend as little as I can on them. :)
16:45  zer0her0: bassliner: i agree on the access to source code and be able to be hackable to my needs, but i realize the people that put work into it need to be compensated for the time/energy
16:45  Leedsman: FriedBob: For sure. I have spent a lot of money (maybe too much) on iPhone apps because, at the time, it was a small investment and it fit a need. Someone took the time to write the code and is taking the time in the future to update it, and I feel that it is worth my monetary reward. On the other hand, I'd never in a million years purchase a Microsoft product because they're not good value for my money.
16:45  zer0her0: and that in this day and age means money.

19:18  zer0her0: cryptic0: for a variety of reasons
19:18  zer0her0: security being first, secrecy being the second.
19:19  LSD`: cryptic0: iPhone Explorer can give you limited umass access if you aren't jailbroken, full if you are I believe
19:21  cryptic0: for once, I would like to transfer mp3s to my phone with finder, than having to go through the crap that itunes is.
19:22  LSD`: Maybe not with iTunes specificially, but I much prefer being able to sync my player than screw around copying files over manually tbh
19:24  zer0her0: cryptic0: maybe you shouldn't have gotten an iPhone?!
19:25  cryptic0: why because I am not an apple fanboy?
19:25  cryptic0: and follow every rule that they set religiously?
19:26  LSD`: The more I look at the alternatives, the more convinced I become that I made the right choice in the iPhone
19:27  zer0her0: cryptic0: it's not like Apple keeps it a secret that they like things done their way, and it's very hard to do things any other way.
19:29  cryptic0: jailbraking the phone is not that difficult anymore.
19:29  LSD`: Is there a 4.1 JB yet?

20:33  xelister: hes status was like wow, finally bought iPad"
20:33  simplicity--: Okay...?
20:33  xelister: and my other friend, is homosexual afaik.  If the first guy bought iPad just 2-3 days ago, is it ok to already introduce them to eachother
20:34  simplicity--: That's truly, really really funny. Now go away.

20:46  CPng|N: you mean lack of
20:51  zer0her0: CPng|N: my </sarcasm> didn't go through ;)
20:55  CPng|N: hhe
20:55  CPng|N: i know
21:18  remyoX: m
21:18  remyoX: Oops, my bad
21:19  sgfgdf: hello guys! when i see "Service Battery" on my menu bar does it means that a 100% i should replace soon the battery?
21:19  ChrisAM: probably
21:19  CPng|N: likely. how old is it?
21:19  ChrisAM: you could try reconditioning it
21:20  CPng|N: yeah. drain it to 0 (dont' run anything important when it gets to 10%, because if it IS bad, it will usually just die early without letting the OS shut down), then charge to full with power off
21:20  sgfgdf: CPng|N: ~2 years.
21:20  CPng|N: oh, i'ts old
21:20  CPng|N: time for a new one
21:21  CPng|N: but the above is worth a try once or twice to see if you can get a little more life out of it
21:21  CPng|N: but you might as well start shopping
21:21  sgfgdf: i think that i don't take special care to my battery and that is the result.
21:21  CPng|N: avoid the Sony ones, get the SMC or some other company's
21:21  Marvolo: My battery is four years old and it's still kicking. The key is to 'exercising' the battery
21:21  ChrisAM: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/9036.html
21:21  CPng|N: yeah you're supposed to train to 0 and charge to full once a month
21:22  remyoX: Same with the iPhone yeah?
21:22  CPng|N: I killed my first because it was plugged in all the time, but applecare replaced it for me. (whew)
21:22  CPng|N: yes
21:22  CPng|N: same with most Lithium Ion batteries, even though they'll often tell you it's ok to just charge it however you want
21:22  sgfgdf: CPng|N: but isn't it too late for this procedure? probably i should start doing this when i bought my mac.
21:22  CPng|N: yes
21:22  CPng|N: so, start doing it with your new one
21:22  CPng|N: but if you got 2 years out of it, that's not too bad
21:22  CPng|N: 2-3 years and they start to bite the dust (usually)
21:23  CPng|N: or, they'll work fine but won't have the longevity they used to have
21:23  Marvolo: Actually, i'm not too accurate it is, but since i started keeping my laptop plugged in 24/7 (as a server) i've noticed the battery "health" has dropped 
21:23  Marvolo: according to the iStat widget
21:24  sgfgdf: CPng|N: how much should cost a battery for a mac book pro model 2008?
21:24  CPng|N: Marvolo:  yup
21:24  CPng|N: they're over USB$100 I believe
21:24  CPng|N: so start saving lol
21:25  sgfgdf: CPng|N: is this from apple store?
21:25  sgfgdf: or they don;t sell them separately?
21:25  sgfgdf: *don't
21:25  CPng|N: they should
21:26  CPng|N: I haven't bought one myself yet, my first 2 were replaced by applecare. so of course the price they say you're "saving" is higher than you'd pay if you were shopping for yourself
21:26  CPng|N: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22macbook+pro%22+2008+battery&hl=en&prmd=s&source=univ&tbs=shop:1&tbo=u&ei=X5-8TNGGKMXflgfagYmODQ&sa=X&oi=product_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQrQQwAA
21:26  CPng|N: look for the one with the highest mAh rating
21:27  CPng|N: better to search for the part number than what I searched for there
21:30  sgfgdf: lol, the new unibody model got battery life of up to 10 hrs.
21:31  sgfgdf: ok, 8 hrs for 15-inch.
21:31  sgfgdf: mine got 4 when i bught it and i was very happy :).
21:32  sgfgdf: CPng|N: thank you for the help! and everyone that helped.
21:34  CPng|N: yeah I have a new unibody 15". it does not get 8 hours unless you dim teh screen and just leave it sitting there lol
21:34  CPng|N: "real work" will not last quite that long, but it is better than the 2008 (which I have at home)
21:35  Marvolo: When I unplug my '06 Macbook, i can get two and a half hours out of it
21:37  masu3701: what's a good apple certificate to have?
21:38 +Berzerker: I can get about 6 hours with just web browsing
21:38 +Berzerker: even though it doesn't say 6 hours, it lasts for about 6 hour
21:38 +Berzerker: s

21:50  ErrantEgo: is there a way to rename apps on the iTouch?
21:51  Marvolo: remind me again who makes the iTouch?
21:51  ErrantEgo: apple
21:54  S_SubZero: I only know unjailbroken devices.  I can't see Apple allowing an app rename on such a device.
21:55  remyo: You can open Get Info on apps in iTunes but can't edit any of the fields
21:55  ErrantEgo: ok
21:55  remyo: ErrantEgo: What is it you wanna rename?
21:56  ErrantEgo: one of the apps ive got on my iTouch
21:56  remyo: Does it have a really long or awful name or something?
21:57  ErrantEgo: not trying to be rude...
21:57  zer0her0: "i like porn"
21:57  ErrantEgo: but what difference does it make
21:57  zer0her0: that's the name of the app isn't it
21:57  ErrantEgo: haha
21:57  remyo: ErrantEgo: Just curious. Sometimes when I ask people about their reasons for things I learn a thing or two myself. Sorry
21:58  ErrantEgo: no reason to be sorry
21:58  ErrantEgo: and if im coming across as being an ass
21:58  ErrantEgo: its not my intention
21:58  remyo: You're not :)
21:58  ErrantEgo: ok
21:58  ErrantEgo: ive got over 160 apps
21:59  ErrantEgo: i was told earlier i can sort these into folders
21:59  ErrantEgo: ive done that
21:59  ErrantEgo: but there are a couple apps i'd like to rename
21:59  ErrantEgo: if i *cant*, its not a big deal
21:59  zer0her0: i don't believe you can
21:59  ErrantEgo: i went from like 10 or 11 "windows" down to 3
21:59  ErrantEgo: lol
22:00  ErrantEgo: its no biggy
22:01  remyo: So it's just so they're easer to spot in the sea of apps you have?
22:07  ErrantEgo: well
22:08  ErrantEgo: (sorry, was yanked afk for a sec)
22:08  ErrantEgo: there are a few apps i have on here that are apps that are related to websites
22:08  ErrantEgo: like craigslist
22:08  ErrantEgo: and urban dictionary
22:08  ErrantEgo: the urban dictionary app is named "UDD Free"
22:09  ErrantEgo: the craigslist app is named "Detroit"
22:09  ErrantEgo: heh
22:14  remyo: Thats clever
22:25  CPng|N: s/clever/lame/
22:27  ErrantEgo: nonetheless
22:27  ErrantEgo: this folder thing helps a LOT
22:28  ErrantEgo: its a slick idea
22:28  ErrantEgo: ive gone from 10 pages down to 3
22:28  ErrantEgo: just sucks that you cant put any more than 12 apps into a folder
22:28  ErrantEgo: ive had to create 3 games folders
22:28  ErrantEgo: because of the game apps ive got on here
22:28  ErrantEgo: :(
22:29  remyo: If you could I think they'd have to shrink the icons. Or add scrollbars. 
22:30  remyo: Neither of which sound that nice to me
22:30  ErrantEgo: yea
22:30  ErrantEgo: its no biggy
22:30  ErrantEgo: the fact im able to create more than 1 folder with the same name works nicely
22:32  remyo: If theres an app I'm not using all the time I pretty much remove it. Thats kept the number down and made things easy to find
22:32  ErrantEgo: heg
22:32  ErrantEgo: heh*
22:33  remyo: But it still lives in iTunes in case I need to enable it again
22:33  ErrantEgo: well, its better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it
22:33  remyo: Yeah
22:33  S_SubZero: *goes to iTunes Store*  *downloads EVERYTHING*  yup, you're right!
22:33  ErrantEgo: hehe
22:34  ErrantEgo: im not THAT dumb
22:35  remyo: S_SubZero: Right on. Because "I'm SURE" a situation will arise where you need a piano that makes cat noises
22:35  S_SubZero: those other 24 fart apps just don't seem to do what i need.. Good thing I have 72 more
22:38  FriedBob: remyo: What about when you need to distract a group of dogs? The cat piano could come in handy then.
22:38  remyo: FriedBob: I know! Thats what I was saying
22:41  remyo: I have about 40 apps on my iphone, including the ones that came with the phone. 
22:41  FriedBob: I have... 0 because I have no iphone.
22:41  ErrantEgo: which ones come with it?
22:41  remyo: Speaking of which, why is Stocks, Weather, etc still not removable??? 
22:45  remyo: ErrantEgo: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/261100/iTunes.png
22:45  remyo: Most of those
22:46  ErrantEgo: lets ee
22:47  ErrantEgo: ya
22:47  ErrantEgo: same stuff thats on the iTouch
22:47  ErrantEgo: ive never seen the compass app though
22:47  ErrantEgo: the rest of em (minus "Apple Store") came with the iTouch
22:47  ErrantEgo: "App Store" is on the iTouch
22:49  rretzbach: hai guise, I want the most power for image editing and gaming in an imac. Best I found so far was: i7-870 2.93GHz, 4GB RAM, HD 5750 << Are there any better graphics cards for imac available?

23:03  zer0her0: it's trackin them down, which is the hassle
23:03  zer0her0: i don't care about spending money or not
