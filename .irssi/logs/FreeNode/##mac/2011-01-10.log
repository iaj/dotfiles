00:02  MrUnagi: i worship you
00:02  MrUnagi: lol
00:03  MrUnagi: jk
00:33  etcetera: anyone know of something like ccleaner for mac? http://www.piriform.com/
00:34  remyo: etcetera: Onyx, http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11582/onyx
00:34  CrypticSquared: onyx can do some of the really basic cleaning of caches and stuff. safari just click reset and then app zapper or the likes
00:34  CrypticSquared: damn you remo :)
00:35  remyo: etcetera: Although I like Applejack a lot more. 
00:35  etcetera: looking for something with a command line interface as well.
00:35  etcetera: would like to be able to fire up terminal or plugin to alfred or quicksilver.
00:36  remyo: etcetera: Well Applejack runs from a commandline before you boot up your mac
00:37  remyo: And if you're into doing things through the terminal. You could make your own shell script that deletes things from certain directories 
00:37  etcetera: yea, but that negates the point of using an app :-P
00:37  remyo: Yep, it sure does
00:38  etcetera: which keeps track of where browsers and such keep caches of information.
00:39  remyo: Well I through out two suggestions. Thats all I've got. If you leave the question out there long enough I'm sure someone else will suggest something esle
00:40  etcetera: cache out x is interesting.
00:41  etcetera: though it doesnt support chrome
00:44  remyo: You might as well make your own shell script 
00:44  remyo: The locations of temp files aren't hard to find

01:17  MrUnagi: im terrified to restore my virtual machines snapshot =/
01:23  remyo: MrUnagi: Then wear a helmet 
01:34  snufft: hey guys, windows user here. i've been handed some flash player files to burn to disc and make autorun on macs and pc's. i've noticed that there is only an executable file on this, there's no hqx or app etc files like i was expecting for mac. does mac now run .exe files?
01:41  Branes: snufft: No, it doesn't. The need to be a non-executable. Macs don't do autorun, btw.
01:41  snufft: serious??? maybe the tutorials i'm looking at are for old versions then....
01:42  snufft: Branes: what is the file format of a mac executable?
01:42  Branes: You'll need to contact the supplier of the Flash stuff and ask for the .swf originals
01:42  snufft: swf's have been included in the files
01:44  Branes: Apple's own - a variant of what's seen in the Unix world, but they wrap the executable and any support files it needs into a single directory called a ".app" which MacOS treats as a single file.
01:45  snufft: ahhhhhhhhhhhhh, that makes sense, i hvae a directory ending in .app
01:46  snufft: does mac offer something similar to windows, where you double click the cd icon, it will run a particular program? or do you have to open the cd and then open the relevant file on a mac?
01:47  Branes: You can't do either with a CD on the Mac. The best you can do is to write the HFS image with the top level of the CD open in a window, with the application dead-centre (and if desired, additional background art with instructions)
01:48  Branes: ... and to do that' you're going to need access to a Mac to set things up how you want before burning.
01:48  Kasm279: whee
01:48  Kasm279: hi Branes
01:49  Branes: o/
01:49  Kasm279: and snufft yeah the .app folder is the Mac executable
01:49  Kasm279: they show up as folders on windows
01:50  snufft: hmmm, ok, thanks guys
01:52  snufft: Branes: is that how installing software works as well? you put the disc in the drive, navigate to the disc, open the disc, locate the relevant file and open that too?
01:52  Kasm279: i can think of something but i think it only works in the Classic OS
01:52  Kasm279: yeah snufft
01:52  Kasm279: Branes: can you create a disc that has files on the desktop?
01:53  Branes: snufft: usually, yes, although skip the open-the-disc bit -- installers (CD/DVD or otherwise) will have it set to a window will open on the desktop as soon as the volume mounts.
01:53  Kasm279: like, in OS9/8/7whatever if you drag a file to the desktop from a removeable disk then eject it it dissapears
01:53  Kasm279: but reapears when you plug the drive back in?
01:53  Branes: Not with OSX.
01:54  snufft: Branes: how do i re-produce that window opening function? os it like an autorun.inf on windows?
01:55  snufft: is it**
01:55  Kasm279: nio
01:55  Kasm279: no*
01:56  Branes: No, you need to work with an image of what's to be burned; you mount it on the Mac's desktop and open windows, arrange icons and what-not as you'd like them to look, then burn that image to DVD as-is.
01:56  Branes: That's why you need a Mac to do this.
01:57  Branes: Apple's Finder stores 'cosmetic' information in metadata files, usually in ".DS_Store" files.
01:58  Kasm279: and TheVolumeSettingsFolder
01:58  Kasm279: no wait
01:58  Kasm279: thats other stuff
01:58  snufft: hmmm, ok, i've got a program here called MacImage that's meant to do the same kind of thing. worst comes to worst, i can get hold of a mac though, i'll play around and see how i go :)
02:00  snufft: thanks guys :)
02:00  Kasm279: no problem
02:00  Branes: No probs. G'luck :)
02:00  Kasm279: so Branes amything new?
02:00  Kasm279: anything*
02:03  Branes: Apart from being pestered for my thoughts on the rise-to-prominence of ARM at CES11 (thanks to my predictions over the last couple months), not a huge lot :)
02:05  AndroidGoat: Hi
02:06  Branes: o/
02:06  AndroidGoat: Haha nice :0
02:22  MrUnagi: ah its a beautiful thing when you see just cron jobs, and ssh sessions you initiate in the log
02:23  Kasm279: ^
02:23  snufft: MrUnagi: qtf, haha
02:23  snufft: qft**
02:23  MrUnagi: qtf?
02:23  Kasm279: qft?
02:24  MrUnagi: qft?
02:24  MrUnagi: i need to harden my web server... =/
02:25  MrUnagi: i noticed one day that i was getting a lot of 200 codes for arbitrary requests
02:26  MrUnagi: that is how i discovered my ip is on an open proxy list....lol
02:26  Kasm279: opn proxy list?
02:26  Kasm279: oh
02:26  Kasm279: lolz
02:27  MrUnagi: yea so people put my ip address, the dew some crazy form hacks on google, and they get honored with 200, but it was being honored with my webpage lol
02:28  MrUnagi: it still happens too i just dunno what i can do about it
03:06  snufft: MrUnagi: first, change ip's :P
03:07 +ChrisAM: MrUnagi ... if you pastebin your httpd.conf, I could take a look

03:07 +crilly: I love being ill... NOT
03:10 +LaraX: crilly: you're sick?
03:10 +crilly: yeah
03:10 +LaraX: :(
03:11 +LaraX: maybe that's part of why you couldn't sleep
03:11 +crilly: possibly. we'll see
03:18  almonds: test
03:18 +ChrisAM: it works!
03:18  almonds: :)
03:19 +crilly: :0
03:19  almonds: so, got a question
03:20  Fedayk1n: so, got an answer
03:20 +LaraX: he does
03:21  almonds: im taking a computer forensics course at school, and need to put together a list of "forensically interesting" spots on a mac
03:21  Fedayk1n: do you have a list of common bsd intrusion points?
03:22 +ChrisAM: almonds ... won't be much different from what you'd find on a mac
03:22  almonds: i have some shell commands but im not sure if they work on BSD
03:22  almonds: for example
03:22  almonds: fs_usage
03:22  almonds: dscacheutil -cachedump -entries
03:22  Fedayk1n: you have a mac yes?
03:22  almonds: yes
03:22  Fedayk1n: open up terminal
03:23  almonds: yea
03:23  Fedayk1n: sudo fs_usage will get you that
03:23  Fedayk1n: dscacheutil isn't root required
03:23  almonds: yea im looking for more commands like that
03:23  almonds: stuff that would help an investigator
03:24  Fedayk1n: do you have a list of apps that run on bsd / linux
03:24  almonds: more towards incident response 
03:24  almonds: what kind of apps?
03:24  Fedayk1n: IDS apps
03:24  almonds: im not looking for IDS exactly, more like data collection post incident 
03:25  Fedayk1n: there are log files, and file system utils
03:25 +ChrisAM: almonds ... explore the dscl command
03:26 +ChrisAM: os x manages passwords differently than the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files
03:26  almonds: yea im looking for basic stuff like lsof -A
03:26  almonds: collecting active connections
03:26  almonds: plist files
03:26  almonds: and so on
03:26  almonds: any ideas/tips?
03:26  MrUnagi: ChrisAM: http://pastebin.com/AYzSV6ae
03:28  almonds: im looking into the dscl command now, thanks
03:32 +ChrisAM: MrUnagi ... try commenting out the whole "<IfModule mod_proxy.c>" section... line 1367 to 1378
03:32  MrUnagi: what is that ifmodule
03:32  MrUnagi: basically an iff statement?
03:33 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v mquin]
03:33  MrUnagi: i remember doing something with this section before and it broke the site
03:33 +ChrisAM: right... if the module is enabled with a LoadModule directive.
03:33  MrUnagi: yea thats why i put in foobar10010101001 blah blah
03:33  MrUnagi: ill try it hang on
03:34  MrUnagi: i have to restart httpd yes?
03:34 +ChrisAM: yes
03:36  almonds: anyone know where the white list file for no script is located on a mac?
03:37  MrUnagi: what in the world lol
03:37  MrUnagi: "/usr/sbin/apachectl: line 82: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Invalid argument"
03:40 +ChrisAM: almonds ... It's in your FireFox preferences file, I belive.
03:40 +ChrisAM: *believe
03:40  almonds: im looking in
03:40  almonds: application support/firefox/profile
03:40 +ChrisAM: user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites",
03:41  almonds: cant find the file that contains all white listed sites
03:41 +ChrisAM: ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/YourProfile/prefs.js
03:41  almonds: and that would contain all sites i white listed in NoScript?
03:42  MrUnagi: how in the world do i edit the apachectl script
03:43 +ChrisAM: MrUnagi ... vim would be a good start
03:44  MrUnagi: just vi /etc/apachectl?
03:47  MrUnagi: omg this is frustrating
03:47 +ChrisAM: if you want to create a new file named apachectl in /etc sure... I would edit the one here: /usr/sbin/apachectl
03:47  MrUnagi: ah thats what i was looking for lol
03:47 +ChrisAM: Why are you editing that file in the first place?
03:48  MrUnagi: http://excid3.com/blog/2010/12/usrsbinapachectl-line-82-ulimit-open-files-cannot-modify-limit-invalid-argument/
03:49  MrUnagi: everything seems to be working ok
03:50  MrUnagi: nope
03:51  MrUnagi: ChrisAM: now i remember why i have that in there
03:51 +ChrisAM: why?
03:52  MrUnagi: because whithout it, if a user puts my ip in on port 80 as their proxy, every request, no matter how arbitrary, is honored with 200
03:52  MrUnagi: but it is honored with my webpage
03:52  MrUnagi: if you want an example, put google.com on port 80 in your web proxy and goto yahoo.com
03:53  MrUnagi: it makes total sense, but i would rather the server throw up a 403 forbidden page, rather than my home page
03:56 +ChrisAM: try adding this to your config:
03:56 +ChrisAM:         RewriteEngine on
03:56 +ChrisAM:         RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} !^(GET|POST|HEAD)$
03:56 +ChrisAM:         RewriteRule .* - [F]

04:03  MrUnagi: i guess virtual hosts is how you host multiple webpages on 1 server huh
04:04  Kasm279: xrandr: well, you need iso
04:05  xrandr: Kasm279: is there a dmg -> iso converter?
04:05  Kasm279: Disk Utility
04:06  xrandr: well, the host OS is Fedora linux.

16:19  Tomis: how big is the library?
16:19  Tomis: how many photos?
16:20  shadewind: 670 photos and 73 videos
16:20  shadewind: I can't imagine that being considered such an extreme
16:23 +crilly: That is a bit odd, to be fair.
16:24  shadewind: the number of photos or the slowness?

16:33  shadewind: I'm beginning to think it has something to do with Parallels for some reason
16:34  simplicity-: Do you have parallels running when it's slow?
16:37 +crilly: shadewind: VMs use a lot of disk access
16:37 +crilly: and RAM.

16:42  eagles0513875: hey Branes what irc network was that osxaudio channel on ?
16:53  asfjio: hello guys! i want to buy an external hard drive for backup for my mac. the question is - do you think 500GB will be enough? based on my mac's hdd - which is almost ~200GB. i would buy 1TB, but can't find good ones. my criteeria is to have FireWire 800 and not to be of those "portable" hard drives (which are almost big as my computer). i found this - ...
16:53  asfjio: ... http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Western+Digital+-+My+Passport+Studio+500GB+External+FireWire+and+USB+2.0+Hard+Drive/9798753.p?id=1218176209517&skuId=9798753 but can't found a TB version of that series. any suggestions, someone who use time machine?
16:57  simplicity-: well, my HD is 250GB, and i made a 300GB partition on my external harddrive, i think it's enouh.
16:57  simplicity-: enough*
17:00  Tu13es: asfjio: are you using Time Machine or ?
17:00  asfjio: simplicity-: does this is managed by the time machine? because i don't know what type of backups it does? probably 1 full backup and then incremental on some interval, but i don't know.
17:00  Tu13es: TM will basically just fill your drive
17:01  Tu13es: it'll make a full backup, and then incremental backups until it fills the drive
17:01  asfjio: Tu13es: i intend to, but don't know if its the best choice.
17:01  Tu13es: the increments are based on how much space it has, i think
17:01  Tu13es: well, how long they're kept, at least
17:02  asfjio: Tu13es: what is the bad thing here? that TM will occupy all the space on the hard drive?
17:02  Tu13es: i suppose
17:03  Tu13es: i don't use TM myself, but because I don't have a dedicated backup drive
17:03  asfjio: Tu13es: when the drive is full what happens?
17:03  Tu13es: but if I did, I'd use it
17:03  Tu13es: asfjio: then it pears down on the incremental backups it's kept
17:03  Tu13es: in order from oldest to newest
17:04  Tu13es: hm, apple says:
17:04  Tu13es: Following the initial backup of your entire Mac, Time Machine automatically makes incremental backups every hour, every day, copying just the files that have changed since your last backup. And it does this all in the background, so you can continue working while Time Machine is busy copying your files. Time Machine saves the hourly backups for the past 24 hours, daily backups for the past month, and weekly backups for everything older than a month.
17:04  asfjio: Tu13es: "pear down"? is that a phrase of removing or something?
17:05  asfjio: Tu13es: sorry for my english.
17:05  Tu13es: I think the thing I just pasted says it better than I did :P
17:06  Tu13es: smoe more info: http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/how-leopard-time-machine-works-and-how-it-doesnt-629
17:06  asfjio: Tu13es: do you know if it is possible to partition the hdd and says TM to use some partition and fill only it?
17:06  asfjio: ah okay
17:06  Tu13es: asfjio: yes, you can do that
17:08  asfjio: Tu13es: s odo you think it is worth to gives TM all 500GB or partition it? any numbers that would be enough? my hdd is ~200GB, but i think i will exclude a lot of movies* stuff.
17:08  Tu13es: depends on how much data you change, how long you need to keep weekly backups for, etc.
17:09  asfjio: Tu13es: you are right, probably it should be my devision. thank you very much for the help!
17:09  asfjio: simplicity-: thank you too!
17:09  Tu13es: no problem
17:09  Tu13es: best of luck
17:34  quella: is it possibal that its not possibal to install windows 7 on a mac mini mid 2010 ??
17:34  quella: iv done everything by the book and i cant get it to boot at all...windows xp works...but not windows 7
17:34  shadewind: simplicity-: no, I don't have it running when the computer is slow
17:35  shadewind: it's not slow all the time
17:35  shadewind: it just get those little hangs every once in a while

17:56  quella: naaa maby 2 month old..
17:56  quella: can it have somthing to do with a ram upgrade ?
17:56  simplicity-: Okay. Well i believe there's a 90 day support-thing with any new mac, might wanna try and call Apple?
17:57  quella: but if so....why does windows xp work..
18:11  Angostura: quella: So it 'trys'  to boot does it - doesn't just go straight into OS X?
18:14  quella: LOL
18:14  quella: apple told me to google the problem LOL
18:15  quella: Angostura no it stalls just rigth before i boots windows and then nothing happes
18:15  quella: its been standing like that for a whole day
18:15  Angostura: Sounds like a faulty Windows 7 install to me
18:16  quella: and if i have the windows cd  in the drive.. then it askes me if i want to boot from the cd...but nothing happens if i try that..it just keeps saying "press a key to boot windows cd"
18:17  Angostura: Dodgy optical media?
18:17  quella: but i installede the same windows on my macbook pro and it works fine
18:17  Angostura: Does the disk still boot in the Mcbook?
18:17  quella: btw the guy from apple told me that i could run .exe files in osx ? is that true ????
18:18  quella: yes
18:18  quella: Angostura i can boot in to osx with out problem
18:18  S_SubZero: I think he may have told you something else that seemed like that.
18:19  Angostura: S_SubZero: I'm trying to determine if the Windows install disk got a scratch between the Macbook install and this install. Hence does the DVD still boot in the MacBook ok
18:20  S_SubZero: i dunno
18:20  quella: the cd is fine
18:20  quella: not a scratch
18:21  quella: S_SubZero i told him you must be joaking me...and then he just laughs at me and tell me that i can run .exe files in osx ?? 
18:21  S_SubZero: no, I don't think an Apple person told you that.
18:22  quella: i wish i have recorded the convasation
18:23  Angostura: quella: So that CD boots ok on the MacBook, or you haven't tried but it looks OK?
18:24  quella: i have tryed and it works fine
18:25  Angostura: And when you say you tried to install it without Bootcamp - what did you do?
18:25  quella: and if i go to macmini and in osx go to boot camp and do all the stuff and then start installation of windows..then it boots the cd fine and installs windows fine...but windows wont boot when the installation is done
18:26  quella: i made bootcamp partition with bootcamp and then in the windows installer i deletet all the partitions and made one for windows..
18:26  quella: still no luck :(
18:28  Angostura: hmmm
18:28  Angostura: The only thing I can think of now is a complete reformat and install

19:13  Fedayk1n: you can also just create a new partition,  adjust the permissions on /users then create a symlink in /
19:13  Fedayk1n: but thats really just a hack

21:31  Mus2aktaS: i don't speak english
21:31  Mus2aktaS: h
21:31  Mus2aktaS: i speak turkish
21:32 +crilly: You might find it hard to get support in here then, sadly.
21:32  simplicity-: crilly, 99% sure that's not possible trough the MiniDP. What you can do is get an USB-thingy, but as i'm sure you know, that's slow.
21:33 +crilly: Ah. The reason I ask if because I think my Samsung SyncMaster 22" is getting long in the tooth now.
21:33 +zer0her0: crilly: yea what simplicity- said
21:34 +crilly: Basically, I'm going to get a new monitor soon I think.
21:34  Fedayk1n: Mus2aktaS: USB VIDEO CARD
21:34 +zer0her0: that being said the USB GFX cards also support 2 monitors as one, i.e. you don't get 2 discrete wallpapers/resolution sets

21:37 +crilly: caseydavis: I assume you're RDPing into something, right?
21:37  caseydavis: yep, RDP'ing into some windows servers and the occasional XP or 7
21:37  HackeMate: is there a way to create an iso image from a dvd using built it program?
21:37  MrUnagi: use vnc or logmein
21:37  HackeMate: or i need download something
21:38  Fedayk1n: caseydavis: um..   yeah there's a good oss RDP app
21:38  Fedayk1n: hold on lemme remember the name
21:39  caseydavis: eh, I have to use remote desktop. I have vnc but I like being able to use various logins.
21:39  Fedayk1n: because yeah  the ms one is assy
21:39  Fedayk1n: CoRD
21:39  caseydavis: HackeMate: goto disk utility, find your volume and click burn.
21:39  caseydavis: oh yeah! I remember CoRD
21:39  Fedayk1n: apparently there's also TSclientX as wellas iRAPP
21:39  Fedayk1n: but I've only used CoRD
21:40 +crilly: That's it, CoRD
21:40  caseydavis: Awesome! I'm going to use CoRD.
21:40  Fedayk1n: TSclientX doesn't look too bad

22:01 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
22:08  neverblue: hi, I have an alias, on my desktop, which has the same name as a folder (both the alias and the folder access the same location, a shared drive on my Win7 station), I would like to delete the alias, but I am unable to (permission issue). To add to the oddity, I cannot view the alias, using ls in the terminal.
22:10 +crilly: neverblue: In a terminal, try 'unlick alias_name'
22:10 +crilly: unlick? ha!
22:10 +crilly: unlink sorry
22:10 +crilly: 'unlink alias_name'
22:10 +crilly: Try it with sudo access if that doesn't work.
22:11  simplicity-: :D
22:11  Fedayk1n: you should symlink that
22:11 +crilly: And if THAT doesn't work, burn the hard drive for it is the spawn of the red beast
22:12  neverblue: i cannot see it in terminal though
22:13  neverblue: the alias that is...
22:13 +crilly: Weird.
22:13  neverblue: truly
22:13  Fedayk1n: delete the folder in terminal via sudo
22:13 +crilly: 'ls -la'?
22:14  neverblue: crilly, correct its not listed using ls
22:14 +crilly: Set the hard drive on fire.
22:14 +crilly: It's evil.
22:14  neverblue: perhaps a bit more background info might be helpful
22:15  neverblue: i would like to access my shared drives (off my win7 box), in doing this System -> Users -> startup, I found that -each- share would be opened in Finder, when the user logins
22:15  neverblue: so I was directed to Automator
22:17  neverblue: i created a script that: mkdir /Users/user/Desktop/share_folder ::  mount_smbfs //server/share /Users/user/Desktop/share_folder
22:18  neverblue: when auto. runs, on user login, the mkdir runs first, then the mount_smbfs occurs
22:18  neverblue: visually, this looks like folder creation on the desktop, then the mount occurs, which creates a new -folder-
22:19  Fedayk1n: oh
22:19  Fedayk1n: its a mount point
22:19  neverblue: the icon looks different
22:19  Fedayk1n: yeah
22:19  Fedayk1n: unmount it
22:19  CPng|N: do I spy Fed?
22:19  neverblue: so I am asuming its a different -type-
22:19 * Fedayk1n ducks
22:19  Fedayk1n: um.. no :D
22:19  Fedayk1n: how goes CP
22:20  neverblue: just like, an alias and a folder
22:20  CPng|N: it goes
22:20  neverblue: they have different icons
22:20  Fedayk1n: neverblue: yeah,  one's not a folder
22:20  CPng|N: Drew?
22:21  Fedayk1n: yeah cp, same me :D
22:21  CPng|N: lol k
22:21  neverblue: so a folder is just an empty folder(visually) whereas a mount point, looks like ?
22:21  CPng|N: whatchu doin in here?
22:21  Fedayk1n: I forgot you joined the cult of the fruit
22:21  Fedayk1n: I'm a fruit culter helping out :D
22:21  CPng|N: ah
22:21  CPng|N: yeah I've been in here for a while on n off
22:21  Fedayk1n: since the hackintosh days
22:21  CPng|N: indeed
22:22  neverblue: anymore ideas crilly ?
22:22  CPng|N: Now my 68 year old mother might need a new computer but I can't convincer to drop 2 grand on a 15" MBP
22:22  Fedayk1n: hahahaha
22:22  CPng|N: so I have to *gasp* find a windows laptop to recommend to her
22:22  Fedayk1n: get the 13"
22:22  CPng|N: she looked at it. too small
22:22  Fedayk1n: neverblue: what do you want to delete
22:22  Fedayk1n: the mount point?
22:23  Fedayk1n: or the folder
22:23  neverblue: Fedayk1n, the alias, with the same name as the folder
22:23  TheNavyBear: I had to replace a fuse on my motherboard (laptop), its back up now
22:23  Fedayk1n: umount it
22:23  CPng|N: welp, bbiab. stick around eh
22:23  neverblue: Fedayk1n, whast does a mount point look like, as an icon ?
22:23  Fedayk1n: CPng|N: will do,  you still have my google talk
22:23  CPng|N: indeed
22:23  CPng|N: HNY btw
22:23  Fedayk1n: as I recall a folder with an arrow on it
22:23  Fedayk1n: same to you!
22:23  Fedayk1n: and on the engagement and kid
22:23  CPng|N: th
22:23  CPng|N: x
22:23  neverblue: Fedayk1n, there is only an alias on the desktop (as an icon), not in the terminal (aka: no file exists)
22:24  CPng|N: just brought him in for his 6 month check up and shots. 
22:24  Fedayk1n: neverblue: yes I know
22:24  neverblue: Fedayk1n, ok, sorry, what do you not know then ?
22:25  CPng|N: please list everything that you do NOT know
22:25  TheNavyBear: damn micro fuses
22:25  CPng|N: and... go!
22:25  Fedayk1n: a mount point is alive in fstab
22:25  neverblue: there seems to be confusion
22:25  Fedayk1n: yeah, you're confused :)
22:25  CPng|N: lol. what's he trying to figure out?
22:25  Fedayk1n: your folder will be listed in finder,  and since its been mounted it'll be in fstab as well
22:25  neverblue: im confused as to why this alias can appear, yet ls -la gives nothing
22:25  Fedayk1n: you must unmount the folder before you can delete it
22:26  neverblue: im not trying to delete a folder, nor a mount point
22:26  CPng|N: umount /Volumes/theThingYouMounted
22:26  neverblue: as I explained multiple times
22:26  Fedayk1n: because its not a real file
22:26  neverblue: well, thanks for your time
22:26  Fedayk1n: so it doesn't exist as a spot in teh filesystem
22:26  CPng|N: is it "net" or "home"?
22:26  Fedayk1n: net
22:26  CPng|N: ah
22:26  CPng|N: you need to disable "show hidden files"
22:27  CPng|N: I just had the same thing on my desktop. out of the blue.
22:27  neverblue: disable show hidden files ?
22:27  CPng|N: I was doign some filesystem stuff so I turned on hidden file visibility in Finder
22:27  CPng|N: and those appeared
22:27  CPng|N: they're on the root of the drive
22:28  neverblue: they, those... what do you mean exactly ?
22:28  CPng|N: but they're links to... I don't know.  Could not figure out why they're there yet point to nothing
22:28  Fedayk1n: neverblue: let me think how to describe this
22:28  CPng|N:  /net /home
22:28  neverblue: i can use the alias
22:28  CPng|N: and 1 or 2 others
22:28  Fedayk1n: because its not a "physical" file or pointer
22:28  CPng|N: it's a network mount
22:28  neverblue: i just dont have permission to move/delete it
22:28  Fedayk1n: right
22:28  CPng|N: even though you have likely never mounted it on purpose
22:28  Fedayk1n: you can't move or delete it
22:28  Fedayk1n: it must be unmounted
22:29  neverblue: it cannot be umounted
22:29  CPng|N: but. if you just disable hidden file visiblity for Finder, they go away
22:29  Fedayk1n: its not a file,  its basically a virtual hard drive
22:29  neverblue: CPng|N, temp fix
22:29  CPng|N: yeah couldn't not even unmount it
22:29  CPng|N: I google for hours
22:29  CPng|N: +d
22:29  neverblue: Fedayk1n, defined where ?
22:30  neverblue: fstab ?
22:30  CPng|N: <CH2OSX:cpn> 0 [2011-01-10 13:30:01] / 
22:30  CPng|N: $ rmdir net

22:30  mgl_2010: Hi! With respect to the updating of the macbook pro, anyone know how long it takes the announcement of the update until it appears on the equipment? This is for the rumors of a 2011 model macbook pro ... Should buy now or i just wait?!
22:30  CPng|N: $ umount net
22:30  CPng|N: umount: unmount(/net): Operation not permitted
22:30  Fedayk1n: cp, you can't get rid of net
22:31  Fedayk1n: and he's talking about a share point he created on his desktop via automator
22:31  CPng|N: oh. I thought he said it was "net"
22:31  CPng|N: the "net" and "home" which appear on the desktop are the above files in /
22:31  CPng|N: "files"
22:32  CPng|N: they are hidden and thus normally one does not see them
22:33  Fedayk1n: and yes neverblue they should be in fstab
22:33  CPng|N: where's fstab?
22:33  CPng|N: I see /etc/fstab.hd and it's essentially empty
22:33  Fedayk1n: well what ever os x uses for mtab / fstab
22:34  neverblue: right
22:34  neverblue: i found the same result, fstab.hd is empty (almost)
22:34  CPng|N: special non-linuxy magic
22:34  neverblue: just comments
22:34  neverblue: I just dont understand why its not listed in ls -la in terminal
22:34  CPng|N: they've moved several system level areas like fstab away from their old *nix roots
22:34  Fedayk1n: /etc/auto_master
22:34  neverblue: if its visible to the end user
22:35  CPng|N: because the desktop is not just /Users/user/Desktop
22:35  neverblue: so to resolve my issue entirely
22:35  neverblue: how -should- I mount my Win7 shared drive ?
22:35  CPng|N: it can also show other things. like in my case, it can show /net and /home from the root of the hard drive
22:35  Fedayk1n: neverblue: connect to the server via finder,  mount the share there, check make persistant
22:36  neverblue: CPng|N, which are visible to the user, but cannot be -viewed- in ls ?
22:36  neverblue: Fedayk1n, i don't believe that is a solution
22:36  neverblue: seems easy/obvious
22:36  CPng|N: I see them in ls. if I go do "ls -laF /"
22:36  neverblue: but there are -many- scripts online for attempting to keep the shares persistent
22:36  Fedayk1n: neverblue: are you trying to present network home shares to domain users?
22:37  Fedayk1n: or just auto mount a share on another box
22:37  neverblue: nope
22:37  neverblue: persisent mount of the win7 share
22:38  neverblue: -F --classify
22:38  neverblue: append indicator to entries
22:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
22:38  CPng|N: open up System Preferences, Accounts, (user), Login Items, click +, clcik the mount (after you've gone into it once is probably best)
22:38  neverblue: i don't see how that would make it visible
22:38 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
22:39  neverblue: CPng|N, that will open a Finder (window?), each time the user logs in for each mount
22:39  CPng|N: click the magic weird icon, hit cmd+option+i   and see what it shows for it's true location
22:39  neverblue: i was hoping to -not- have that happen, so I moved on to Automator
22:40  CPng|N: ah. yeah it opens a finder window. someone was trying to do this a few days ago, I don't know if we ever found a perfect solution, I forget
22:40  neverblue: perhaps it was me
22:40  neverblue: i have been working on this for over a week or two
22:40  CPng|N: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031022164821984  ?
22:41  neverblue: command-option-i 	multi-item Inspector for all selected files 
22:41  Fedayk1n: tell application "Finder"
22:41  Fedayk1n: 	mount volume "smb://WORKGROUP;username:password@machine_name/directory"
22:41  Fedayk1n: end tell
22:41  Fedayk1n: is how to do it via applscript
22:41  neverblue: is applescript used in Automator ?
22:42  CPng|N: oops, this is newer
22:42  CPng|N: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100203124656707
22:42  neverblue: because what I wrote looks closely to a bashscript
22:42  CPng|N: that looks like the linuxy mount way for Snow Leopard
22:42  neverblue: that last URL looks promising
22:42  CPng|N: try that
22:42  CPng|N: I think it's the new way of doing fstab
22:42  neverblue: i will
22:43  CPng|N: bbl, would like to hear if it works
22:43  CPng|N: ;)
22:43  neverblue: i wont be home for a few hours
22:43  neverblue: so ill give it a try
22:43  neverblue: and let the channel know
22:44  Fedayk1n: cp,  correct thats the new 10.6 way
22:44  Fedayk1n: with the autofs crap
22:45  Fedayk1n: (which is what I was looking for)
22:46  Fedayk1n: (autofs is new and strange)
22:46  Fedayk1n: I really need to buy lion for unix nerds when it comes out
22:49  LzrdKing: "lion for unix nerds"? is that a movie?
22:51  simplicity-: heh
22:52  Fedayk1n: is a book
22:52  Fedayk1n: for os x 10.7
22:54  simplicity-: Okay, by who? :-)
22:54  Fedayk1n: Oreilly usually
22:54  simplicity-: Cool.
22:55  Fedayk1n: sorry
22:55  Fedayk1n: Mac OS X for Unix Geeks (lion edition)
22:56  shadewind: how can I adjust the frame of a UILabel in IB to fit the content text?
22:56  Fedayk1n: move the bounding box?
22:56  simplicity-: I guess you could just make it fill the whole screen and choose the arrangement you want for you text?
22:57  shadewind: seems like I can only align left/right/center
22:57  shadewind: not top/bottom
22:58  simplicity-: maybe they'll be more at help in #iosdev or #macosxdev
22:58  shadewind: oh... wrong channel sorry
22:58  shadewind: I though I was in there...
22:59  simplicity-: heh ;)
23:13  Mob|away: crilly u around
23:13 +crilly: I am now.
23:13 +crilly: What's going down?
23:13  Mob|away: is ntop good to use
23:13 +crilly: ntop? As in the network equal of top?
23:13  Mob|away: or do u suggest something else for mac
23:14  Mob|away: yes
23:14  Mob|away: i want to look at all my traffic
23:14  Mob|away: on my network
23:14 +crilly: netstat?
23:14 +crilly: oh err
23:14 +crilly: Hmm.
23:14  Fedayk1n: use the network utility
23:14  Fedayk1n: unless you just want to watch packets travel
23:14  Mob|away: Fedayk1n will that do all on network
23:15 +crilly: On the entire network, including other hosts and switches/routers?
23:15  Fedayk1n: wait,  yeah what all do you want to monior
23:16  Mob|away: ok my mac is wireless so i want to use this to see all traffic on my network including my xbox ect....
23:18 +crilly: Are they wireless as well? If so, that won't be too difficult as everything on the wireless will be in a single broadcast/collision domain
23:18 +crilly: If you have wired entities as well, it will require something fancy like Cacti setup to SNMP the hosts for information.
23:19 +crilly: Mob|away: I'll VPN into my work's network and show you Cacti. Maybe this will illustrate what you want
23:19 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
23:20  Mob|away: crilly ok
23:21 +crilly: Mob|away: Like this? http://cl.ly/2E3i2h0x1g3x2y241l0L
23:22 +crilly: Or do you want to see actual data?
23:22  CPng|N: Wireshark
23:23  Fedayk1n: little snitch
23:23 +crilly: CPng|N: It can't see other devices (unless they're on the same Wireless network, then it might be able to pick those packets up too).
23:23  Fedayk1n: oh
23:23  Fedayk1n: you want mrtg for your router
23:24  Mob|away: crilly yea 
23:24 +crilly: That's what Cacti does, Fedayk1n 
23:24 +crilly: Mob|away: Yeah what?
23:24  Mob|away: crilly all i need is too see all my traffice on my mac xbox and ps3
23:24  CPng|N: sorry didn't read his specific need. hard to see other traffic on a switch. and no one uses hubs. and he said wireless anyway, so neither of those apply
23:24  Mob|away: yes its wireless
23:24  Fedayk1n: what kinda router you have?
23:25  Mob|away: all 3 are wireless
23:25  Fedayk1n: 3rd party hardware that shiz
23:25  CPng|N: you want that one hacker app. uhmm
23:25  Fedayk1n: er firmware
23:25 +crilly: Mob|away: I don't think you'll be able too on your Xbox and PS3. What router do you have? It might support SNMP and if so, you can likely poll it for stats on each interface (port) being used.
23:25  CPng|N: KisMAC?
23:25  Fedayk1n: yeah might have snmp traps, but then you'd need a babysitter app
23:25  Mob|away: i have a netgare
23:25  Mob|away: netgare
23:25 +crilly: Mob|away: Try Wireshark and see if it can see the entire wireless network's traffic.
23:25  Mob|away: so ntop is no good for this 
23:26  Fedayk1n: Mob|away: what kinda netgear
23:26  Mob|away: one sec
23:26  CPng|N: http://trac.kismac-ng.org/        Welcome to the KisMAC wiki! KisMAC is an open-source and free sniffer/scanner application for Mac OS X. It has an advantage over MacStumbler / iStumbler / NetStumbler in that it uses monitor mode and passive scanning.
23:26  Mob|away: i have to run downstairs and look
23:27  CPng|N: so there's 4 suggestions. Kismac, macstumbler, istumbler, netstumbler. obviously kismac sounds like the win

23:30  Mob|away: FriedBob wireless n
23:30  CPng|N: Mob|away:  scroll up 1 line
23:30  Mob|away: Fedayk1n
23:30  Fedayk1n: probably can't hack the firmware on it anyway
23:30  Fedayk1n: look into kismac
23:30  Fedayk1n: kismet was awesome
23:31  Fedayk1n: I'm sure the macport is great as well
23:31 +crilly: Mob|away: That's the wireless mode it is capable of. Get a model number.
23:31  Mob|away: wrn2000
23:31 +crilly: Well if it doesn't support SNMP natively, see if a dd-wrt install will (or whatever it's called).
23:32  Mob|away: i'm lost now
23:32  Mob|away: too many answers
23:32  Mob|away: :(
23:32  Mob|away: Fedayk1n u said to try kismac?
23:32 +crilly: Mob|away: OK basically use one of the tools suggested, or poll the router for the information via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
23:33  CPng|N: _I_ said to try kismac
23:33  salamandyr: anyone know if the adoption of Sandy Bridge cpus will allow larger amounts of max RAM in the MBPros?
23:33  Mob|away: CPng|N ok sorry
23:33  Fedayk1n: I agreed
23:33  CPng|N: or google "kismac wireless traffic"
23:33  Mob|away: looking for the link now
23:33  CPng|N: Fed backed me up tho. just look into it geez ;)
23:34  CPng|N: salamandyr:  Apple might know
23:34  CPng|N: regardless of what the CPU allows, it will largely depend on what Apple allows
23:34  salamandyr: heh
23:35  salamandyr: i just want a MPB with more than 8gb of RAM, is that too much to ask?  :)
23:35 +crilly: It's down to the EFI coding I think.
23:35 +crilly: Or some chip.
23:35 +crilly: MacBooks are identical to MacBook Pros except the latter can upgrade to 8GB of RAM because the Mac permits it.
23:36  Mob|away: thanks crilly CPng|N and Fedayk1n 
23:36  CPng|N: salamandyr:  currently? yes
23:36  CPng|N: good luck Mob
23:36  salamandyr: heh
23:36  salamandyr: i've got a 6gb limit on my current MBP.. sad.  
23:36  salamandyr: and i routinely use up all the 12gb installed in my imac, too
23:37  salamandyr: doesnt sandy bridge benefit from ram in triples?
23:38  salamandyr: if so.. seems apple would allow 3 x 4gb chips, w/o any new engineering
23:47 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
23:48  [Kevin]: yeah most high-end laptops allow up to 16gb ram, except for the current macbook pros
23:48  [Kevin]: I know a few allow 24gb
23:48  [Kevin]: but those are twice as thick as a macbook pro and get an hour of battery life
23:50 +crilly: lol
23:50  salamandyr: heh, definitel a point
23:50  salamandyr: still, a 3-slot RAM MBPro seems doable
23:51  CPng|N: something being doable, and expecting it in a future apple product, are 2 entirely different things
23:52  salamandyr: :)
23:52  salamandyr: gotta run guys - thanks for the commends.
