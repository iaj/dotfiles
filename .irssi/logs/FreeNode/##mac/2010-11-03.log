12:29  robgleeson:  hm, does anyone know how to group movies, that weren't downloaded from iTunes, into genres?
12:38  Brisk: robgleeson: hit cmd-i and add a genre to the movies, then sort?
12:41  robgleeson: Brisk: thanks, is there a genre view?
12:42  Brisk: if you're in the list view, then yes
12:42  Brisk: and if there isn't a genre heading in list view, then cmd-j will bring up the window that lets you enable it
12:43  robgleeson: hm okay, yeah I was hoping you could get a folder representing genres but no worries.
12:43  robgleeson: thanks
12:46  Brisk: actually
12:46  Brisk: if you do the third option, the double rows of square icons in the view chooser
12:46  Brisk: that might be what you're looking for, robgleeson 
12:46  Brisk: it sorts like it does for iTunes U, but by genre instead of course (i.e. one "Short Film" icon, that you click to list all the short films)
12:46  robgleeson: cool, but how do I do that? not entirely certain.
12:46  Brisk: robgleeson: http://i7.noahdj.ca/20101103074537.png like that
12:46  robgleeson: oh yeah :D
12:46  robgleeson: thanks!!
12:46  Brisk: :)
12:47  robgleeson: hrm, is it possible to set a picture for a genre too? right now it's a sneak peek of the videos inside.
12:50  Brisk: robgleeson: the artwork works like the events icons in iPhoto (i.e. as you move your mouse across the icon it shows the different videos inside)â€¦ you can set the default image/icon to the artwork of any of the videos, so you could work with that
12:50  Brisk: i.e. take whatever image you want and make it the artwork for one of the videos in the category, then set that as the default artwork for that genre
12:51  Brisk: iTunes has asome default artwork for genres as well
12:52  Brisk: you can find the genres with artwork if you look in the iTunes app package 
12:52  robgleeson: that'll work :)
12:52  robgleeson: cheers

14:54  Edogaa: Hey, why is it when I try to open an html file to view on the browser it shows the actual source
14:54  Edogaa: instead of how it would look?
14:55  Angostura: Edogaa: Can you link to the file somewhere (DropBox)
14:55  Edogaa: :/
14:56  Angostura: meaning?
14:56  Edogaa: Hold up...
14:56  Edogaa: i need to download dropbox?
14:56  Edogaa: okay then
14:57  zer0her0: Edogaa: are you sure it's a valid html file?
14:58  Edogaa: Pretty sure but i'll check again
14:59  Edogaa: http://pastebin.com/R14T0YLs
15:00  Edogaa: i might've put the inline css wrong though...
15:00  Edogaa: nope, its right
15:01  zer0her0: weird, what browsers?
15:01  Edogaa: safari
15:02  Edogaa: its even in plain text...
15:03  Edogaa: and all it shows when i click on it (with the .html extension) is just the source and on the browser o_O
15:03  zer0her0: what did you make it in?
15:03  Edogaa: textedit
15:03  zer0her0: Edogaa: are you sure you saved it as plaintext?
15:04  Edogaa: Yes
15:04  Edogaa: I opened preferences
15:04  Edogaa: and set it to plain text
15:04  Edogaa: instead of rich text
15:04  zer0her0: Edogaa: w/ the doc open in the format menu, does it say: make rich text or make plaint ext
15:04  zer0her0: s/ext/text
15:05  Edogaa: make plain...
15:05  Edogaa: :/
15:05 * Edogaa headdesk.
15:06  zer0her0: ;)
15:06  zer0her0: yea use textwrangler or something
15:06  zer0her0: textedit will make you want to kick things through the wall for code work'
15:06  Edogaa: lol
15:08  Edogaa: I;m mostly using the Macs since they;re the most stable machines available in this school in comparison to all the other window machines available in the courtyard. So I'm not exactly so used to this yet (keeps forgetting the preference bar is at the top of the screen instead of the window) :|
15:09  zer0her0: Edogaa: sounds like the reason my brother "switched"
15:09  Edogaa: yeah, i'm gonna use something else :|
15:09  Edogaa: this testedit is ticking me off
15:09  zer0her0: you can't install other software?
15:11  Edogaa: Oh, I can, i just nee to do so in the home directory
15:12  Edogaa: Not sure if its allowed but no one has told me off yet so I doubt they care lol...
15:13  zer0her0: Edogaa: i'd suggest looking at textwrangler it's free: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/
15:13  Edogaa: kk'
15:14  Edogaa: or users directory
15:16  Edogaa: Also, I didn't claim to switch. Although, I wouldn't mind getting a Mac next to a linux and windows machine now lol... :|
15:16  zer0her0: i didn't say you switched
15:16  zer0her0: i said my brother did
15:16  Edogaa: Ah, kk
15:17  torchie: my textwrangler broke
15:17  torchie: i am sad
15:17 * zer0her0 gives torchie a cookie
15:17  zer0her0: my linux machine broke
15:17  zer0her0: i am sad
15:17  zer0her0: though i'm replacing it next week, yea!
15:20  CEnTR4L: I was pretty damn excited & happy kicking off my weekend right now and minutes after coming home I feel incredibly depressed and disgusted.
15:20  CEnTR4L: WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!
15:23  torchie: it's wednesday

15:52  tonechef: Anyone here running linux on their macbook 5,1 without overheating problems?
15:52  Edogaa: there we go, thats better... albeit i'm not too used to emacs lol
15:52  zer0her0: vim!!!!
15:52  Edogaa: yes, I like vim better
15:52  zer0her0: tonechef: yea, it's called virtual box and/or ssh
15:52  zer0her0: ;)
15:53  tonechef: Ha
15:53  zer0her0: seriously running Linux on bare metal is not really the best route on mac hardware
15:54  Edogaa: why? D:
15:54  tonechef: I have since realized this.. I can't wait to get rid of this thing.. no offense to the macs I think they are built very nicely but they just aren't for me.. 
15:54  tonechef: Too bad because that new macbook air is sick
15:55  zer0her0: Edogaa: apple doesn't release all the docs on the power management, CPUs run at max voltage supposedly when running linux or other none supported OS, i.e. Mac OS X or Windows via bootcamp
15:55  ayaz: tonechef: What that a Fruedian slip, or did you really mean to say 'sick'?
15:55  Edogaa: Right.
15:56  tonechef: ayaz: I said sick.. oh my I did not use proper engrish
16:21  webPragmatist: guys guys
16:21  zer0her0: girls girls
16:23  Valley: transgenders? 
16:24  zer0her0: :)
16:44  eagles0513875: hey guys how can i tell if someone has hacked me?
16:45  Edogaa: >_> did you accept files from someone you don;t know? run random applications from the internet? Go to any questionable sites?
16:45  Edogaa: If no, you likely haven't been 'hacked' D:
16:46  Edogaa: Errr...
16:46  Edogaa: he left rather quickly
16:46  zer0her0: the hacker knew and disconnected him
16:46  Edogaa: XD
16:46 * zer0her0 hacks Edogaa next
16:46  Edogaa: lol
16:47  zer0her0: :)
16:49  Edogaa: wonder, how many not deprecated html tags are there
16:49  zer0her0: how many active html tags there are?
16:49  Edogaa: yes :| not sure why i'd need to know though
16:50 * Angostura still misses <blink>
16:50  Angostura: ... not really
16:50  Edogaa: what?
16:51 --- Guest63497 is now known as Bensawsome
16:51  zer0her0: Angostura: you shut your mouth, you shut it right now
16:51  zer0her0: :)
16:51  Edogaa: what the heck is the 'blink' tag?
16:51  Edogaa: a flash tag D:
16:52  zer0her0: Edogaa: you're a youngin huh?
16:52  Edogaa: depends, is 20 young? D:
16:52  zer0her0: i think blink was the FIRST despreciated tag
16:52  Edogaa: ah
16:52  zer0her0: it prob was gone before you were born ;)
16:52  Angostura: Very very deprecated
16:53  zer0her0: j/k
16:53  Angostura: so deprecated you could hear the cheering in  the street
16:53  hvgotcodes: sometimes when i unplug my MBP the screen flickers for a few seconds
16:53  hvgotcodes: is that normal?
16:53  Angostura: (apart from Geocities)
16:53  Millsie: I'm 20 and I know what a <blink> tag is...
16:53  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: the built in screen?
16:53  zer0her0: if so, no, that's not
16:53  Millsie: but it's okay because now I can HTML5 Pulse
16:53  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: yeah
16:53 * Millsie looks at the irony
16:54  zer0her0: oh reminds me i need to grab the geocities torrent
16:54  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: should i be worried?
16:54  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: is it under warranty?
16:54  hvgotcodes: yes
16:54  zer0her0: i'd bring it into an apple shop
16:54  zer0her0: that's not normal
16:54  hvgotcodes: i cant afford to have it out of commision for a long time
16:54  Millsie: What's the geocities torrent?
16:54  zer0her0: Millsie: http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/11/geocities-lives-on-as-massive-torrent-download/
16:55  zer0her0: i wonder if i have any content in that torrent, i think i had stuff on both geocities and angelfire
16:55  Millsie: I think I do...
16:56  Millsie: if only my VPS had 652GB HDD
16:56  Millsie: :sadface:
16:56  zer0her0: hehe yea, my linux box i'm building currently only has 500GB RAID in the spec
16:57  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: it might have something to do with the fact that i have 2 external displays, and when i go to meeting i just rip all the plugged in things out
16:57  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: ooohh
16:57  zer0her0: hehe
16:57  zer0her0: yea that's it just refreshing it's displays and settings then
16:57  zer0her0: no worries w/ that
16:57  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: its not the standard blue screen -- the screen flickers really fast
16:57  hvgotcodes: and it only happens sometimes
16:58  zer0her0: yea it still sounds like lcd refresh and monitor detection
16:58  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: ok
16:58  hvgotcodes: thanx
16:58  zer0her0: the blue screen is generally rez detection/resizing
16:58  hvgotcodes: right
17:20  webPragmatist: mac sucks ugh

17:21  Valley: k
17:21  webPragmatist: alot
17:22  Angostura: in what particular ways, oh disgruntled one
17:26  S_SubZero: the only thing that sucks about my MacBook Pro is how it has been functioning pretty much perfectly, and that makes it utterly boring. 8P
17:27  Angostura: S_SubZero: In the good old days you could have just installed a few Inits
17:33  iaj: lo there ive got a problem with pages - can I somehow disable the 'some warning occured message' upon startup?
17:39  eagles0513875: hey guys whats the name of the firewall log so i can check if anything is logged to it
17:40  eagles0513875: ahhh where can i find out the ip of somone who was possibly trying to hack me
17:41  eagles0513875: and also does an iphone app exist to where one can control volume and starting of applications on a laptop or other mac product
17:42  eagles0513875: anyone
17:44  eagles0513875: :(
17:44  Jarvis: aww shame, i was about to ask him what made him think somone was hacking him :p
17:48  remyo: Jarvis: If you walk down the street and say to any one person "I'm hacking into your computer", I bet you 8/10 people would buy it
17:55  Jarvis: remyo: quite possibly, but he was talking like he had evidence , i was interested to see what he had :P
17:56  Jarvis: Allthough somone telling you that somone from 127.0.0.1 was trying to hack him would be amusing :P
17:56  remyo: HA! :D 
17:59  spline: zOMG localhost!
18:02  zer0her0: haha he comes in asks the same questions then quits in 4 minutes
18:02  zer0her0: i'm going to ban him if i see him do this again
18:04  remyo: Is impatience grounds for banning someone?
18:05  remyo: Or do you think they're jerking everyones chain on purpose? 
18:05  zer0her0: no annoying ops is grounds for banning though
18:05  zer0her0: he's asked the question at least 4-5 times today when i've been at my desk, i always go to respond and he signs off
18:06  zer0her0: others have tried to help him w/ similiar prob
18:06  remyo: I see
