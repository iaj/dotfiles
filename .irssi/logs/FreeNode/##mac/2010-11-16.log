00:00  CPng|N: damn straight
00:02 @crilly: Juo: CPng|N is a know-it-all, so he can assit you.
00:02 @crilly: :P
00:02  CPng|N: :P
00:03  Juo: I just need to install Windows on a netbook, I only have Macs to do this with
00:03  Juo: it for a friend, I dont even use windows
00:03  torchie: nobody uses windows :D
00:03  torchie: windows isn't something you use, it's something you have
00:04  Juo: I installed Ubuntu on the netbook but the wifi drives dont work

00:09  CPng|N: but Ubuntu Just Worksâ„¢
00:09  CPng|N: lol
00:09 @crilly: hhaaa!
00:09 @crilly: OS X does.
00:09  CPng|N: thank you
00:09  CPng|N: heh
00:10 @crilly: We need an OS X theme for phpBB3.
00:10  CPng|N: so uh, I lost track
00:11  CPng|N: and I just realized that I also need to put a 10.6 install DVD onto a bootable USB stick 
00:14 @crilly: Is that legal?
00:14  S_SubZero: i dont think a Mac can even boot from USB without like rEFIt
00:14 @crilly: I thought Macs could boot from a USB drive and a Firewire drive?
00:15  S_SubZero: an optical drive perhaps
00:15 @crilly: They can definitely boot from a FW drive, fact.
00:15 @crilly: Not sure about USB though.
00:15  Juo: ive booted my Mac off an iPod over USB before
00:15  Juo: with mass storage enabled 
00:16  Juo: actually i formatted it, so basically USB hard disc
00:19  S_SubZero: the process seems to vary from "can't" to "hold down key" to "will automatically boot" depending on the site 
00:20 @crilly: :/
00:20 @crilly: This is why we need to start filling our forum (ircmac.com) with articles, papers and tutorials on doing stuff we know works.
00:21 @ChrisAM: That sounds a lot like work.
00:22 @crilly: ;p
00:23  CPng|N: how much does it pay? :\
00:25  S_SubZero: it pays in open source dollars (ie. a blank piece of paper you write any number on)
00:25 @crilly: It pays <3 once a month
00:26  bsdbandit: im thinking about picking up an extra job working at the apple store 
00:26  bsdbandit: is it worth it 
00:26  bsdbandit: right now im working as a unix engineer
00:26  CPng|N: seems like a step down
00:26 @crilly: if you're a unix engineer and you need extra work/cash, I would find more lucrative work.
00:26  bsdbandit: well this is going to be a part time job 
00:26  bsdbandit: on the weekends 
00:26  CPng|N: but seems like it'd at least be worth a shot if you need some extra mula
00:27  bsdbandit: oh ok 
00:27  bsdbandit: yeah i was thinking about it 
00:27  CPng|N: change of pace
00:27  bsdbandit: i enjoy working with mac
00:27  bsdbandit: s
00:27  CPng|N: I'd imagine you wouldn't want to do an extra 2 day of the same type of work. burn out
00:27  bsdbandit: yeah 
00:27  bsdbandit: it might be a burn out

01:35  Kasm279: hm
01:35  diffract|: i had an older macbook and it probably crashed once every 5-6 months
01:35  diffract|: i got this one about 40 days ago and i had lots of crashes
01:36  augi01: What do you mean by "crash"?
01:36  diffract|: like the whole system locks up
01:36  schmity: diffract|: Ive had 6 kernal panics within 6 days of each other :\

02:06  Hedonist: beatles tomrrow, mark my words
02:06 @ChrisAM: Hedonist ... your guess for the "big announcement" ?
02:07  Hedonist: yeah
02:08 @ChrisAM: that would be pretty lame.
02:08  Hedonist: , lol but seriously im not sure. I just read that and it sounded possible
02:08  Hedonist: I can't even imagine what they will release tomorrow
02:08  Tsavo: Something Magical no doubt
02:09  sontek: Whats the best way to get bootcamp setup? I tried using the bootcamp util but it couldn't repartiion/move the files it needed to
02:09  Hedonist: lol
02:09 @ChrisAM: I'm guessing the announcement is not going to be "iTunes is removing the extra crap and will use half as much RAM"
02:09  Hedonist: magical you say...? http://lh5.ggpht.com/_pFuueSeWrVs/TCn4K0NgKWI/AAAAAAAASZg/cBFlG8a4Ols/coolaideyes.png
02:09  sontek: Can I do a factory restory of osx and then try?  I don't know where the cd's that came with my macbook are
02:10  Tsavo: ah haha Hedonist. sontek I tried using the command line to do the Boot Camp partition thing, but it didn't work because I didn't have enough space left
02:10  Tsavo: Do you have at least 5GB left + the space you're tyring to partition? the 5gb as a buffer
02:11  sontek: I have like 200gb free
02:11  sontek: and was only trying to give it 25
02:12  sontek: it said it couldn't move some files
02:13  Tsavo: Because I'm on Tiger I followed these instructions:
02:13  Tsavo: http://www.ffnn.nl/pages/articles/apple-mac-os-x/nondestructive-partitioning.php
02:13  Tsavo: It's the same thing that Boot Camp does, with out the pretty interface and Progress bars
02:13  Tsavo: It may work for you rather than Boot Camp

02:15  Tsavo: Also sontek be careful of Electron Migration if you install Linux on your Mac
02:16  Tsavo: Linux doesn't know how to use the SMC to control the voltages within your computer which results in over-voltage in critical parts
02:16  sontek: Tsavo: Is there a way to handle that properly?
02:17  Tsavo: I've never been able to partition my mac either, so I haven't researched it 
02:18 @ChrisAM: Linux is best ssh'd to.
02:19  Hedonist: wat
02:19 @ChrisAM: heh
02:19  Hedonist: holy fck I didn't know that
02:19  Hedonist: I hope I get to remember that when I get a mac
02:20  Hedonist: if I ever get one :(

02:23  webPragmatist: quickbooks for mac is fail
02:23  sontek: I basically use osx as a VM host for linux
02:23  sontek: I just boot up and launch vmware
02:23  Tsavo: who is branes?
02:23  Kasm279: Tsavo: a person in here
02:23  thelostpatrol: he's the branes of the operation
02:24  Tsavo: har har
02:24  thelostpatrol: :)
02:24  Kasm279: he has no source for this info
02:24  Kasm279: it is not verifyable
02:24  Kasm279: all the google results lead back to him
02:26  sontek: bootcamp says Back up the disk and use Disk Utility to format it as a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) volume. Restore your information to the disk and try using Boot Camp Assistant again.
02:26  sontek: will that wipe osx?
02:26  Tsavo: Formatting erases the disk, so that's why you back it up
02:27  sontek: a backup will restore the OS as well?

02:33  sontek: think it'd be good enough to just back up all my large files and then repartition?
02:33  sontek: there isn't a defrag tool?
02:33 @ChrisAM: nope
02:34  vxla: sure there is, fsck
02:34 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 84 seconds
02:34  vxla: but it's a different filesystem structure, so it deals more with inodes than with the data itself
02:34 @ChrisAM: I wouldn't be comfortable mucking around unless I had both a good backup and an OS X disc.
02:36  lewellyn: poor larax
02:37  vxla: what happened?
02:39  sontek: i'm deleting everything, hopefully deleting + fsck will get bootcamp going
02:39  sontek: Whats the legality of torrenting osx? I obviously own a copy since I own a macbook
02:39  thelostpatrol: not legal
02:39 +Tomis: there is no legality in pirating the os
02:40  thelostpatrol: if you require a backup you need to call apple
02:40  sontek: They'll replace the disk?
02:40  thelostpatrol: yes, for a small charge
02:40 +Tomis: you can order replacement system DVDs from apple, or purchase the OS retail
02:40 +Tomis: retail won't have the hardware tests for your machine though
02:41  thelostpatrol: what version are you running sontek?
02:41  sontek: thelostpatrol: 10.6.4
02:42  thelostpatrol: then yeah, just get apple to send you another disc, it'll be about 10-12 bucks if i recall correctly
02:42  sontek: macbook pro core i5
02:42 +Tomis: how'd you manage to lose your system DVDs that quick
02:42  tntc: which disk?
02:43 +Tomis: i'd advise making backups of the DVDs as well
02:43  sontek: Tomis: I think they still might be in Atlanta, but I wont be going there for a couple more weeks
02:43  sontek: Tomis: I just moved but still have stuff at my old place

02:45  sontek: SL?
02:45  tntc: sontek: oh, I meant "which disk is missing"
02:45 +Tomis: Snow Leopard
02:45  sontek: ahh
02:45  sontek: yeah, I guess $30 is worth it
02:45 +Tomis: the $30 OS only disk doesn't inclue iLife and iWork though
02:45 @ChrisAM: true
02:46 +Tomis: if you just need to reformat so bootcamp will partition nice
02:46  sontek: what do those include?
02:46 @ChrisAM: call 1-800-SOS-APPL with your serial number and they can send you some new system discs
02:46 +Tomis: then all you need is a system DVD from another machine
02:46  sontek: I don't know if my default install from apple came with them 
02:46 +Tomis: it did sontek 
02:46 @ChrisAM: all new macs come with it
02:46  sontek: Is that for imovie and everything?
02:46 +Tomis: they include iLife with every mac
02:47 +Tomis: and a demo of iWork
02:47 +Tomis: http://www.apple.com/ilife/ and http://www.apple.com/iwork/
02:47  sontek: yeah, I definitely have ilife but not iwork
02:49 +Tomis: mm, new iLife '11 is $49
02:49 +Tomis: but iWork is still $79
02:49 +Tomis: i wonder when they'll update it
02:50  tntc: I was stoked because I just got a new mac like the month before.  They sold me iLife '11 for like $5
02:50 +Tomis: yea, the up-to-date program
02:50 +Tomis: i haven't been liking the changes in ilife the past couple years
02:51  thelostpatrol: i'm still using ilife 08
02:51  thelostpatrol: barely, though. i don't have much use for most of the programs actually.
02:51 +Tomis: i use garageband a lot
02:51 +Tomis: imovie is useless crap
02:51  thelostpatrol: or... any of them really.
02:51  thelostpatrol: iDVD is probably the most useless of them all
02:51 +Tomis: don't touch the rest of it
02:51 +Tomis: yea i played with the rest of the apps like once
02:52 +Tomis: iDVD should really be rolled into iMovie
02:52  thelostpatrol: i agree.
02:53 +Tomis: it's just like a minor sub-feature that no one uses, like book making in iPhoto
02:54  thelostpatrol: yep
02:55  thelostpatrol: i only used it once in university
02:57  Kasm279: i wish i could use iDVD on my iMac
02:57  Kasm279: needs moar G4
02:57 +Tomis: needs more intel
02:59 +Tomis: ok, i hate google image search, any suggestions for something better that doesn't take me to a damned click-through page?
03:01  Velociraptors: Folks, with RAM/CPU/HD/network not being oversubscribed, what would cause a Mac Pro (8GB/3TB/3GHz octocore) to turn into a bit of a slug with some horrid delays while app-switching, loading files in photoshop/textedit, slow web-browsing etc after around 30 desktop apps are running. 
03:02  sontek: Tomis: http://elzr.com/imagery
03:02  thelostpatrol: probably the 30 apps
03:03 +Tomis: how much free ram do you have at that point Velociraptors 
03:03  Velociraptors: aye - quitting a bunch and going down to 20 or so speeds it right back up again - so something's causing a slowdown
03:03  Velociraptors: Tomis:  2GB free, 1.5GB inactive
03:03 +Tomis: very odd
03:03  thelostpatrol: 8GB isn't a lot for 30 apps, i'd say
03:03  Velociraptors: CPU is between 10 an 80%
03:03 +Tomis: and what's the CPU idlenes
03:03  Velociraptors: out of 800%
03:04  Velociraptors: idle shows 85-98%
03:04 +Tomis: hmm
03:04  Velociraptors: in iStat menus
03:04 +Tomis: and what about the disk throuhput
03:04 +Tomis: if you have 30 apps all wanting the disk at once, it's going to thrash like mad
03:04  Velociraptors: activity monitor has the HDs being touched from time to time, 4-100KB/sec, usually 9
03:04  Velociraptors: usually 0, sorry
03:05  Velociraptors: surprisingly minimal!
03:05  Velociraptors: the sound of these relatively noisy HDs betrays when they're being used too, and they're quiet atm :)
03:05 +Tomis: thanks sontek , checking it out
03:07  Velociraptors: thelostpatrol:  photoshop and aperture are the big ones, behind that Opera and iTUnes, the rest are little utils like dictionary, addressbook, tweetie, textedit etc - all fits in under 6GB according to activity monitor!
03:07  thelostpatrol: ah. then it isn't so bad.
03:07  Velociraptors: this has popped up from time to time on this machine for ages, and it's never been a real *problem*. quitting a bunch of apps I haven't used for a few hours is a simple fix
03:07  Velociraptors: but now I'm *curious* :)
03:07  thelostpatrol: hehe i get ya
03:07  Velociraptors: is there a way to measure memory bandwidth use on OSX?
03:08  Kasm279: Velociraptors: that has more space than my iMac
03:08  Kasm279: more RAM than hard drive space
03:08  Kasm279: lol
03:08  Velociraptors: :)
03:08  thelostpatrol: i still have a windows mentality when it comes to app closing--i close them when i don't need to use them anymore for any foreseen amount of time
03:08  Velociraptors: like my IIsi!
03:08  Velociraptors: 40MB HD and 64MB RAM
03:08  thelostpatrol: the only apps i leave on are transmission, skype and mail usually
03:08  Kasm279: i always keep opera open and KVIrc
03:09  Velociraptors: yeah - I never used windows, so never got into that habit :)
03:09  Kasm279: iTune smost of the time
03:09  sontek: so do dual boot osx + linux, do I need refit?
03:09  Kasm279: only time i ever close iTunes and opera is when i go to play games
03:09  Kasm279: and even then i just mimimize iTunes
03:09  Kasm279: sontek: did you google? >.>
03:09  thelostpatrol: what games do you play in osx?
03:09  sontek: Kasm279: I've seen people recommend it, thats why I'm asking
03:10  Kasm279: thelostpatrol: well, this is windows im talking about
03:10  sontek: but I thought bootcamp would do everything I neede
03:10  Kasm279: sontek: then use it :P
03:10  Kasm279: and no
03:10  Kasm279: bootcamp won't
03:10  thelostpatrol: ah.
03:10  Kasm279: thelostpatrol: but i can play tremulous and warsow on OSX
03:10  Kasm279: if i had something faster than 400MHz ;)
03:10  Kasm279: or reay just a faster video card
03:11  thelostpatrol: i use windows 7 for games on this mbp
03:11  thelostpatrol: restart whenever i feel like playing anything
03:11  Kasm279: heh
03:11  Kasm279: the only game i really play is Tremulous
03:12  Kasm279: i don't play alot
03:12  Kasm279: but when i do pay i play for two or three hours straight
03:16  thelostpatrol: what's this warsow thing you speak of?
03:18  Kasm279: thedonvaughn: reay fast paced game
03:18  Kasm279: basically Q3 with cartoonish graphics, walkicks, and extreme speed
03:18  Kasm279: its great.. if you have good internet
03:19  thelostpatrol: cool
03:19  Kasm279: this is like
03:19  Kasm279: 1500 ups fast
03:20  luist: hey how can i run an .exe file that is on my mac inside my windows virtual box?
03:20  Kasm279: luist: get it into the VM
03:20  luist: Kasm279: o rly? :P
03:20 +Tomis: drop it into the VM
03:20  Kasm279: luist: yeah, depends on what VM you are using
03:20  Kasm279: :P
03:20 +Tomis: turn on file sharing, copy it over
03:20 +Tomis: drop it into the VM window
03:21 +Tomis: drop the file into a shared local folder
03:21 +Tomis: all depends on the VM being used and how you choose to set it up
03:24  sontek: I use vmware fusion and when I try to run a .exe in osx it automatically launches the VM
03:34  sontek: BAD SUPER BLOCK: MAGIC NUMBER WRONG
03:34  sontek: that sounds bad at least
03:37  sontek: This disk needs to be repaired. Start up your computer with another disk (such as your Mac OS X installation disc), and then use Disk Utility to repair this disk.
03:37  sontek: so I guess i'm going to need those disks lol
03:37 @ChrisAM: do you have another mac available?
03:37  sontek: there isn't a single user mode I can boot into and fix it?
03:38  sontek: I don't, this is my first one
03:39 @ChrisAM: even in single user mode, disks would still be mounted.
03:41  sontek: Do you think fsck could repair it?
03:41  sontek: I could boot into a linux livecd

03:50 @ChrisAM: ah
03:51  webPragmatist: is it possible to use a specific excel sheet to pull this data from for charts?
03:51 @ChrisAM: from word?
03:52 @ChrisAM: Why I usually do is create the chart in Excel, and then link the chart directly from Word.
03:52 @ChrisAM: so when the excel file changes, the chart in word gets updated automatically.

04:09  webPragmatist: ChrisAM: ah
04:10  webPragmatist: ChrisAM: where do you set which excel file?
04:10 @ChrisAM: Do you want to change it?
04:10 +LaraX: danl: I haven't forgotten what today was :) (if you're here...)
04:10 @ChrisAM: Click the Office Button (is that what it's called?) then go to Prepare, and there should be something about links to files
04:11  webPragmatist: well
04:11  webPragmatist: how do you link it to begin with?
04:12 @ChrisAM: Copy from Excel, go to word, and then Paste Special
04:12 @ChrisAM: then choose Link
04:13  webPragmatist: hrm
04:13 @ChrisAM: I don't have office at home... just going from memory from work.
04:14  webPragmatist: well
04:15  webPragmatist: ChrisAM: oh so you create the chart in excel and paste it in
04:16 @ChrisAM: if you just paste it, it will be static. If you paste it as a link, it will update itself as the excel sheet gets updated.
04:16  webPragmatist: well i know it's an object
04:16  webPragmatist: but my question is different
04:16  webPragmatist: so word has this built in chart creation shit
04:17  webPragmatist: and each chart you create it makes a new workbook
04:17  webPragmatist: the upside it is formatted perfectly
04:17  webPragmatist: the downside it's a new workbook everytime
04:17 @ChrisAM: webPragmatist ... this: http://www.addictivetips.com/microsoft-office/embed-data-sheet-from-excel-2010-to-word-document/
04:18 @ChrisAM: word charts are teh suck
04:18  webPragmatist: hrm
04:18 @ChrisAM: leave word to write words, and excel to do the numbers and mathy stuff.
04:21  webPragmatist: oh wait i  got it :)
04:24  webPragmatist: gdammit
04:30  webPragmatist: i broke excel
04:30  webPragmatist: it just sits here doing this shit http://screencast.com/t/GTQgrlGEK3
04:31  webPragmatist: piece of crap
04:32  webPragmatist: ChrisAM: ah here we goâ€¦ want to know the tricky way to do this heh
04:32  webPragmatist: make it in wordâ€¦ then paste the chart in to excelâ€¦ then save the excel..
04:32  webPragmatist: wa fucking la
04:32 @ChrisAM: meh
04:44  webPragmatist: bleg
04:45  webPragmatist: buggy as shit this office 2011
04:45  webPragmatist: I have a stupid tooltip that is stuck open
05:03  thelostpatrol: every time i run my torrents, my browser stops loading pages. wtf?
05:04  diffract|: your internet must suck
05:05  diffract|: try to limit the speed of your torrent client
05:10 +Tomis: but i want to torrent the whole world through my fat pipe!
05:18  derp: Hmm
05:18  derp: is Airtunes worth getting?
05:20 +Tomis: airtunes is just apple's proprietary media streaming protocol
05:21 +Tomis: the question you have to ask is, is the price of the few products that support it, worth the cost
05:23 @ChrisAM: I had an airport express anyway... I really like airtunes.
05:23  falcom: what's a great book mark manager/syncer?
05:23 +Tomis: i like the idea of it, but now how they've let it linger
05:24 +Tomis: airtunes should be a systemwide audio output device , with support built into the audio framework for audio latency and video syncing
05:25 @ChrisAM: you can get Airfoil for that
05:25 +Tomis: i shouldn't have to
05:25  diffract|: how do i disable ctrl+option for moving windows? i can't see it in the keyboard shortcuts preferences panel
05:26 +Tomis: disable control-option for doing what?
05:26  diffract|: for moving windows
05:26 +Tomis: huh?
05:26  diffract|: when i keep them pressed, it moves the window in focus
05:26 +Tomis: no
05:26 +Tomis: that sounds like some 3rd party software you have installed
05:26  diffract|: that's what it does here
05:27  diffract|: hmm, maybe it's hyperDock
05:27  sontek: so I got into a linux livecd, ran hfsck on it, it told me it wasn't an HFS+ partition, I'm able to mount it and everything, but it wont fsck i
05:27  diffract|: yup that's it
05:27  diffract|: thanks
05:27  sontek: but now osx wont boot up either
05:27  sontek: it sits on a grey screen for along time then says missing operating system
05:27 +Tomis: reformat with mac os x sontek 
05:28  sontek: Tomis: I would like to but my cds are either lost or in Atlanta, which is 6hrs away :p
05:28  sontek: and the closest apple store is 4hrs
05:28 +Tomis: well yer in a pickle then
05:29 @ChrisAM: a wise man once said: [11/15/2010 20:34:52] ChrisAM: I wouldn't be comfortable mucking around unless I had both a good backup and an OS X disc.
05:29 +Tomis: heh
05:29 +Tomis: a wise man once quoted himself
05:30  derp: How do i import my playlists from iTunes from Windows to my new iTunes on my mac
05:30  sontek: ChrisAM: haha, I wasn't comfortable doing i, but had no choice! :P
05:30 +Tomis: i'd just copy the music library folder over derp
05:30  derp: ah ok
05:30 +Tomis: you can also do an export/import of the library file
05:31 +Tomis: and move over the files sepperately i guess
05:31 @ChrisAM: iTunes has an export/import playlist function
05:32 * derp will check
05:32  derp: I know it has export/import
05:32  derp: I use it often
05:39  sontek: So if I find someone with restore disks/os disk is there a way to have them work for my macbook? I have a couple friends who have macbooks
05:41 +Tomis: they probably won't instal
05:41 +Tomis: but you could use disk utility from them
05:48  webPragmatist: ChrisAM: man this shit didn't work at all lol
05:48  webPragmatist: sorry for the french
05:48  webPragmatist: so okay i made all my charts in excelâ€¦ when try to paste them into word it says i'm a retard
05:48  webPragmatist: what gives?
05:48  webPragmatist: heh
05:50  sontek: Tomis: my buddy says he has a snow leopard disk, is that all I need to get disk util?
05:50  webPragmatist: it says my excel is already opened
05:50  webPragmatist: http://screencast.com/t/WRAsvtN0h0k6
05:50  webPragmatist: sontek: yes
05:52  webPragmatist: man thats a weird one
05:53  webPragmatist: lkjadsfkljdslfkjasdlkfjd 
05:53  webPragmatist: http://screencast.com/t/piEsOomlI6BU
05:53 +Tomis: yea just boot it from that disk sontek 
05:53  webPragmatist: i'm just trying to drag the dam think below in word
05:53 +Tomis: then you can try to repair the disk, maybe image it
05:53  webPragmatist: wtmf
06:02  bonez2046: are Mac to ubuntu printing questions fair game here? 
06:03  thelostpatrol: sure, though i don't know the answer :P
06:06 +Tomis: answer: something to do with CUPS
06:06  bonez2046: thelostpatrol: well, here's my question.. so you'll have an answer to work up.. I have an ubuntu box.. 10.04, to which my laserjet iiip is attached.. it's served me well nearly 20 years now.. I want to share it with my home lan.. to which my wife MacBook is connected wirelessly.. I 'see' my ubuntu server, when I attempt to add an ipp printer.. 
06:06  beterraba: how to initiate Java Run Environment?
06:06  bonez2046: yet.. no print jobs every make it.. always get response that the printer is busy or some other such errors.. 
06:07  bonez2046: Tomis: I have CUPS running.. Apples 'own's CUPS now.. so this should work but does not
06:11  thelostpatrol: i'm afraid i can't help, i don't know ubuntu very well

07:29  thelostpatrol: but in a way where most of it still functions properly

14:17  paul_uk: hey all, i've recently got a mac mini and i upgraded it from 512mb to 2gb of ram.  i now notice that no soundcard comes up as being recognised.  what could i have unplugged for this to happen?
14:18  DoFoT9: hmm nothing really paul_uk 
14:18  DoFoT9: when you say no soundcard.. how do you mean?
14:18  DoFoT9: through system prefs->sound?
14:18  paul_uk: yeah no soundcard is recognised and no chime happens when i restart the unit
14:19  DoFoT9: is the unit on mute?
14:19  paul_uk: no
14:19  paul_uk: have you ever taken apart a mac mini before?
14:19  DoFoT9: unfortunately not
14:20  paul_uk: i dont think you can help then...  i've obviously unplugged a cable from the motherboard without realising it
14:20  DoFoT9: but to my knowledge there is nowhere to unplug the sound
14:20  DoFoT9: its straight on the motherboard
14:21  DoFoT9: nowhere to disconnect it
14:21  paul_uk: then maybe i have given it a static shock and blown it :P
14:21  DoFoT9: possibility
14:23  paul_uk: no, i now know what happens.  I broke off the ribbon socket that is on the back of the interconnect controller card that the CD and the hard drive connect to
14:23  paul_uk: it just popped out stupid thing and i put it back but no sound
14:23  DoFoT9: :o
14:24  paul_uk: yeah check here for more pics: http://forum.hardmac.com/index.php?showtopic=6535
14:25  paul_uk: anyone here taken apart a mac mini ?
14:26  DoFoT9: might have to use a USB sound card then
14:26  DoFoT9: they are super cheap on ebay :D
14:27  paul_uk: i have no need for sound, as its going to be a dev machine for my iphone app
14:27  DoFoT9: oohhh
14:27  DoFoT9: i see
14:27  paul_uk: but i wanted to know if anyone else was in the same situation and resolved it or not

16:03  Marctraider: stock is 500/790/1100
16:03  Marctraider: ;)
16:07  Marctraider: DarkStar1: thats not completely right ;) My harddisk is presumably one of the slowest components but in-game it hardly touches the drive since most is precached :p So it will in fact be quite fast
16:10  DarkStar1: Marctraider: You're quite right. But your RAM is still slower than your processor.
