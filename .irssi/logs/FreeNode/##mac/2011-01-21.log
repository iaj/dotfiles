19:15  CPng|N: adamfield:  it's a handy place if you set a corner to show the desktop
19:15 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 98 seconds
19:16  CPng|N: grab file in finder, hook your mouse into the corner to show desktop, drop there or in a folder
19:16  CPng|N: problem is, people leave crap there. and in their downloads folder
19:16  Tomis: or hit the expose key
19:17  CPng|N: I just cleaned out a ton of crap myself. unfiled documents, mp3s, 
19:19  Nina: What do u think about a MBA 13" 1,8Ghz, 2GB RAM, SSD for web and smartphones development ?
19:19  Tomis: i think, get a real computer
19:20  Tomis: but that's just me
19:21  Nina: What would u do with "just" 1400 euros ?
19:21  Tomis: get a macbook pro
19:21  S_SubZero: at least a white macbook
19:22  Tomis: oh god no, might as well get the air then
19:22  Nina: Tomis: mbp 13" is better ?
19:22  Tomis: if you're doing dev work, you want as much ram and CPU as you can get, who wants to be waiting around while stuff compiles?
19:23  Tomis: no, anything less than the 15" MBP is a complete joke IMO
19:23  S_SubZero: I'm no dev but I can't see an iPhone app taking "waiting around" time to compile.
19:23  sanguisleft: Tomis: shes doing web dev most of that is interpreted init?
19:23  Tomis: if you were asking for a machine to just do the usual web/email/youtube, then a macbook would be more than enough
19:23  Tomis: "and smartphones"
19:24  Tomis: this is just my opinion mind you, i'm sure there are other people who use the air for dev work and find it acceptable
19:24  sanguisleft: yo/me sits down and shuts up
19:24  Nina: (web & android and maybe iphone for the futurs)
19:24  Tomis: i think for the money you might as well get the most machine you can though
19:28  Nina: Tomis: Some test shows the macbook air 13" 1,8Ghz 2GB is better than the macbook pro 13" 2,4GHz 4GB RAM. And just for load application, I saw in a store that is true. But for a compilation it's certainly different
19:28  Tomis: that's just because of the SSD
19:28  Nina: Yes
19:28  Tomis: if you put an SSD in both machines, it's a different situation
19:29  Tomis: you can change the HD in the macbook pro aftermarket, or order it with an SSD
19:29  Tomis: not sure how the price comparison changes at that point
19:29  Nina: gimme the money :(
19:30  Tomis: personally i'm waiting for the hybrid drives to reach maturity
19:30  Tomis: then i'll stick one in this 15" MBP
19:31  Nina: And the refurb is a good solution ?
19:31  Tomis: yes
19:32  Tomis: it comes with a full warranty etc.
19:32  Tomis: unfortunately it's not that great of a savings for me because apple has to charge sales tax in my state
19:32  Tomis: and amazon etc. don't
19:32  Tomis: so it was cheeper to buy a new one with a rebate elsewhere
19:33  Nina: where do u leave Tomis ?
19:33  Tomis: i'm in california
19:36  Nina: Tomis: A MBP 13" 2,4Ghz, 4GB RAM and a 128go SSD = 1376euros
19:36  Tomis: so that's less than the air?
19:38  Nina: Tomis: the air with 4GB is at 1306euros
19:38  Nina: (1300€ ~= 1800$ US)
19:38  Tomis: oh bummer
19:38  Tomis: of course, this is apple's prices
19:38  Tomis: if you get that SSD after-market it'll be much less
19:40  Nina: Tomis: 300€ for the SSD
19:40  Tomis: apple wants $350 for 128GB SSD on the 13" MBP
19:41  Tomis: going on newegg.com i'm seeing prices from $149 to $339 for the same capacity SSD
19:42  S_SubZero: when I got my MBP in 2009 I got it with the base hard drive, then ordered a 500GB 7200RPM model.  It cost less than if I just got the MBP with it, took 15 minutes to put in, reloaded the OS and now I have a spare 5400rpm hard drive.
19:42  Nina: Tomis: i'm not a handyman
19:43  Tomis: well i found it very easy to change the HD on my MBP
19:43  Tomis: yup, same here S_SubZero 
19:43  Tomis: the manual that comes with the machine even tells you how to change the HD
19:44  Nina: hd to ssd ?
19:44  Tomis: i ordered my MBP and 7200rpm 500GB at the same time, much less than ordering it from apple, and now i have a spare
19:44  Tomis: nah, just normal platter drive
19:44  Nina: ok
19:44  Tomis: the SSD drives are in the same form factor though
19:45  Nina: i don't think
19:45  Tomis: i'm waiting for the hybrid drives to mature though, much better cost/performance ratio
19:45  Nina: sre
19:45  Nina: sure
19:45  simplicity-: SSDs are the same form factor?
19:45  Tomis: yes, you can get SSD in the same 2.5" form factor
19:45  Nina: oh ok
19:45  Tomis: the SSD in the air use a new "stick" form
19:46  Tomis: which really makes more sense for SSD
19:46  sanguisleft: Umm I need to use wget on my mac but all I can find is people telling me to compile it my self, I have no problem with that but I dont know what software to use for compelling , I am a linux user stuck with a mac at work
19:46  Nina: So Tomis 
19:46  Tomis: instal Xcode sanguisleft 
19:46  Nina: Tomis: What I buy =P ?
19:47  Tomis: there's also curl sanguisleft 
19:47  Tomis: tha'ts up to you Nina 
19:47  Never_gonna_give: can someone convert an iwork document to word for me?
19:47  Tomis: personally, i would have gone with the 13" MBP, but it's an udnerpowered outdated machine right now
19:48 --- Never_gonna_give is now known as rcmaehl
19:48  Tomis: why not ask them to send it to you in the format you need rcmaehl 
19:48  rcmaehl: no
19:48  S_SubZero: iWork can save as Word documents.
19:48  rcmaehl: yes
19:49  rcmaehl: but I/WE don't have access to Iwork anymroe
19:49  Tomis: do you needto edit it, or jsut view it
19:49  Tomis: if you only need to view it, just ask for it in PDF format
19:49  rcmaehl: how do I get that
19:50  Tomis: ask them to send it to you in PDF format
19:50  Tomis: they can export it to PDF
19:50  rcmaehl: I can't
19:50  rcmaehl: we don't have access to iword anymore
19:50  rcmaehl: as in the sender
19:50  rcmaehl: too
19:50  Nina: Tomis: for u, the problem with the MBA is when i'll compile ?
19:51  Tomis: it doesn't have enoguh performance for the money IMO Nina 
19:51  S_SubZero: The Air is about being wedge shaped and portable.  To get that thin it had to use a lower-end processor.
19:51  Tomis: the only feature the air has is that it's lightweight, if that isn't a selling point for you, then i'd suggest looking at the other machines paired with an after-market SSD
19:52  MrUnagi: can rsync re arrange dir structure if the file already exists on the destination?
19:52  Nina: Tomis: Like a MBP 13" at the refurb :p ?
19:53  MrUnagi: i e source: /path/to/file       dest:/path/file       becomes dest:/path/to/file without transferring?
19:53  Tomis: yea Nina 
19:53  Tomis: you'll save some money that way
19:53  Tomis: then get an SSD after market
19:54  rcmaehl: nvm It  opens as an archive
19:54  rcmaehl: and I copyed the text from the pdf inside the archive
19:55  rcmaehl: who knew?
19:55  rcmaehl: well thanks anywa
19:55  rcmaehl: y
19:55  Nina_: Oops Tomis 
19:55  Nina_: :D
19:55  webPragmatist: is there a software for mac to view the contents of a zip instead of just extracting the whole thing somewhere?
19:55  Nina_: I said : As a MBP on the refurb ? with a ":p" :)
19:55  Tomis: yes webPragmatist , there are quicklook plugins for that
19:56  Tomis: google "qlArchive" or something like that
19:56  Tomis: you'll find it
19:56  Tomis: try searching macupdate.com and the like as well
19:56 +FriedBob: Or 7zip
19:56  webPragmatist: ya i don't want a quicklook plugin
19:56  webPragmatist: half the time these are attachments in outlook
19:57  Tomis: um, why not a quicklook plugin?
19:57  Tomis: you'd still need to deal with the actual file on disk if you wanted to open them in something else anyway
19:58  webPragmatist: Tomis: what? if you double click on an attachment it should open the zips contents
19:58  Tomis: eh?
19:59  Tomis: you double-click, it extracts the contents
19:59  webPragmatist: no thanks
19:59  Tomis: oh.. you want to change the default app
19:59  Tomis: and extract individual files and crap like that
19:59  Tomis: just like winzip on the PC
19:59  webPragmatist: right
19:59  webPragmatist: or 7zip
19:59  Tomis: yea, i've seen apps that do that
19:59  Tomis: don't remember the names off the top of my head
19:59  Tomis: search macupdate.com
20:02 * TheNavyBear stabs the MTA repeatedly
20:03  Tomis: MTA?
20:03  TheNavyBear: Metro Transit Authority (NYC Transit)
20:03  S_SubZero: mail transfer agent
20:04  Tomis: uh oh, don't let them find out you said that about them
20:04  Tomis: you'll be labeled a terrorist pretty quick
20:04  TheNavyBear: I have no train to get to work now
20:04  webPragmatist: FriedBob: is 7zip compiled for mac?
20:04  Tomis: rudy gulianni will pesonally show up at your houseand tazer you
20:04  webPragmatist: all i found was a command line one
20:05  MrUnagi: anyone use rsync
20:05  TheNavyBear: rudy g is not mayor anymore, and bloomberg wouldn't come here, he doesn't go near gays because he fears he can catch the gay by being around them
20:06  Tomis: isn't that how you catch fish, by being around them?
20:06  TheNavyBear: lol
20:06  Tomis: so it stands to reason, if you want to catch a gay, you have to be around them
20:06  TheNavyBear: not catch a gay, catch THE GAY
20:07  webPragmatist: i have a sore throat am i catching the gay?
20:07  TheNavyBear: lol
20:08  MrUnagi: RSYNC!
20:08  TheNavyBear: it can notb be caught
20:08  Tomis: maybe it's sore from all that running you've been doing *trying* to catch it
20:08  webPragmatist: MrUnagi: rsync -ahv --progress is all you need
20:09  MrUnagi: hmmmm no special flag is needed?
20:09  webPragmatist: what are you trying to do?
20:10  MrUnagi: can rsync re arrange dir structure if the file already exists on the destination?i e source: /path/to/file      dest:/path/file      becomes dest:/path/to/file without transferring?
20:10  webPragmatist: no?
20:10  webPragmatist: you can delete non-existing files on the remote end
20:10  MrUnagi: well that sucks
20:10  webPragmatist: that's the only way that would occur
20:11  webPragmatist: i use something call lsyncd for linux and i have the same problem
20:11  MrUnagi: i guess i just need to organize before i rsync
20:11  webPragmatist: it basically will sync dirs based on file operationss
20:11  webPragmatist: but all it does is see a mv and run rsync
20:12  MrUnagi: maybe i could write a script to do it
20:12  webPragmatist: the issue is, from a file operation standpoint, there's no such thing as "mv"
20:12  webPragmatist: it's just "copy then rm"
20:13  MrUnagi: like.......compare a dry run of rsync with the directory structure locally, then do a for loop for each line, finding the location of the file locally, and remotely making the directory structure
20:13  MrUnagi: that would be awesome
20:17  MrUnagi: no?
20:42  andy5635353: i am looking for a way to 'load' a paste list into the right click of the mouse so i can paste one after another of a list of id's to go through id's in a web admin system . does such a thing exist???
20:46  Angostura: andy5635353: Explain again?
20:46  andy5635353: i have a list of ids, say 1,2,3,4,5
20:46  andy5635353: i want to be able to paste them into an admin sys one after another 
20:47  andy5635353: instead of cutting and pasting from the list into the admin
20:47  andy5635353: imagine i 'arm' the  click and then can paste one after another into the admin system like a 'clip' of bullets
20:48  andy5635353: i doubt this exists actually
20:48 --- mikeplus64 is now known as mikeplus32
20:48  andy5635353: it is for a browser based admin system for the web
20:54  adamfield: andy
20:54  adamfield: look into clipmenu
20:54  adamfield: :D
20:55  adamfield: you cant map it to right click, but you can map it to cmd+shift+v

21:08  geekie: hai, does anyone know how I can run a shell script which says "permission denied?"
21:08  geekie: I'm trying to do the normal ./make.sh
21:08  geekie: but it says permission denied and I changed every single file to 777 and it still doesn't work
21:08  geekie: (running mac os x 10.6)
21:11  neverblue: well
21:11  neverblue: changing to 777 should do it
21:11  geekie: It didn't. :]
21:12  neverblue: it would depend on what users/groups were assigned 777
21:12  neverblue: perhaps you could use sudo ?
21:12  neverblue: also, since its a make file, I dont believe that is the correct syntax
21:12 --- mikeplus64 is now known as mikeplus32
21:13  geekie: That's the syntax the website is giving :p
21:13  geekie: weird :/
21:15  geekie: solved it :)
21:15  geekie: "chmod a+x make.sh" worked :D
21:19  GodIsAnAstronaut: Hi, I want to make a duplicate of an audio cd so I booted Disk Utility, but when I select the disk, I can't choose "New Image", very annoying, any reasons why I can't turn the CD into an image?
21:20  Tomis: i thought you could image audio CDs
21:20  Tomis: if not, then just rip & burn using itunes
21:20  adamfield: you want a nice little program called "burn"
21:20  adamfield: LD
21:20  adamfield: :D
21:20  Tomis: burn can image audio disks?
21:20  adamfield: it can
21:20  adamfield: http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html
21:20  GodIsAnAstronaut: why can't Disk Utility do that?
21:21 * adamfield shrugs
21:21  Tomis: i thought it was only for burning CDs
21:21  adamfield: why image an adio cd?
21:21  Tomis: not imaging them
21:21  adamfield: disk utility is more for managing partitions and filesystems
21:21  GodIsAnAstronaut: ok
21:21  Tomis: i was talking about that burn app
21:21  GodIsAnAstronaut: well it did fine for data CDs
21:21  GodIsAnAstronaut: I'm downloading the burn app
21:21  adamfield: i make images of all sorts of crap with burn
21:22  Tomis: yea i don't understand why DU can't ISO an audio CD
21:22  adamfield: why do you need an image?
21:22  GodIsAnAstronaut: adamfield: Heh, family tech support, she wants a copy of her english lessons :)
21:22  Tomis: what, she doesn't have an ipod?!
21:22  Tomis: blasphemy
21:22  adamfield: so just rip to mp3 and burn
21:23  adamfield: imaging is kind of pointless
21:23  GodIsAnAstronaut: she's nearly 50
21:23  GodIsAnAstronaut: no she doesn't have an ipod heh
21:23  Tomis: get her one!
21:23  adamfield: yeah
21:23  adamfield: ipod touch ftw
21:23  Tomis: i got my mom an ipod
21:23  Tomis: that she barely uses, heh
21:23  GodIsAnAstronaut: heh, that's what I'd expect
21:23  Tomis: her car doesn't have aux in
21:24  GodIsAnAstronaut: she could really use an ipad though, but I'm not gonna buy her one hah
21:24  Tomis: and the fm transmitters are a bitch, completely useless
21:24  GodIsAnAstronaut: I use spotify for all my music, it's awesome :)
21:25  GodIsAnAstronaut: but the premium is quite pricey, 10 euros per month.. but well, you can listen to absolutely anything for that, so I guess, in the end, it's cheap.
21:26  GodIsAnAstronaut: but I'm not paying 10 euros per month.
21:26  GodIsAnAstronaut: Burn could use an icon designer
21:27  GodIsAnAstronaut: ah it works, thanks!
21:30  pfein: ugh, HD in my Air is failing
21:30  GodIsAnAstronaut: aw
21:30  GodIsAnAstronaut: is it old?
21:30  pfein: about 3 years
21:31  pfein: usually, I would just replace it myself, but...
21:31  GodIsAnAstronaut: hmm
21:32  GodIsAnAstronaut: but?
21:32  pfein: but it's a fucking Air. ;-(
21:32  pfein: like, not exactly very user-servicable.
21:32  GodIsAnAstronaut: it's gonna get expensive to fix that?
21:32  pfein: I would expect so. ;-(
21:33  GodIsAnAstronaut: when I go to university and I compare my battery time to a friend with a macbook, with both a full battery, his remaining time is min. 4 hours, and mine is about 2 hours..
21:33  GodIsAnAstronaut: but the system info says my battery health is fine
21:33  pfein: anybody cracked the case on Air before?
21:35  GodIsAnAstronaut: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m062C4rLiE4
21:35  GodIsAnAstronaut: you just take the screws out?
21:35  GodIsAnAstronaut: I think I should do that too with my MBP, to take the dust out?
21:37  GodIsAnAstronaut: "they say" the new Airs are better than the MBP, that's odd :s
21:39  adamfield: my buddy has an i5 pro
21:39  adamfield: his wife has a 13 air
21:39  adamfield: the air is actually snappier
21:39  simplicity-: Sure is.
21:39  simplicity-: SSD does that. But try compiling something, that Air will be slow.
21:39  adamfield: of course, it flounders on big shit like VMs etc, but - in general performance, its faster
21:39  simplicity-: or Flash Drive, as it is.
21:39  adamfield: simplicity-: glad im not a dev
21:39  adamfield: ill happily take a new air over my pro
21:40  simplicity-: heh
21:40  adamfield: all i need is terminal + ssh
21:40  simplicity-: Yeah i love my Pro with SSD ;)
21:40  adamfield: and commuting? my 08 pro is heavy
21:40  adamfield: simplicity-: same
21:40  adamfield: early 08 with ssd + 6GB ram
21:40  adamfield: 3 years old and still a monster
21:40  simplicity-: :P
21:41  adamfield: only downside
21:41  adamfield: early 08 pro on new battery ~4h battery
21:41  adamfield: 13" air? 8h battery
21:42  adamfield: you can imagine where im siding on my next purchase
21:42  simplicity-: 13" is only 7h
21:42  simplicity-: 13" MBP is 10h..
21:42  Tomis: yea i get around 8 to 10 on my MBP if i really push it
21:42  adamfield: unibody yeah?
21:42  Tomis: drop the backlight on the screen and keyboard
21:42  simplicity-: I love my 13", it's a good combination with size and power. But if i had an iMac at home i would easily go for a 13" Air.
21:43  Tomis: yea unibody
21:43  adamfield: my 15" pro will become an imac
21:43  Tomis: the air is useless to me
21:43  simplicity-: Well, no.
21:43  adamfield: when im at hoem it docks with a 27" monitor
21:43  Tomis: might as well get an ipad
21:43  simplicity-: Doesn't make it an iMac, adamfield.. :D
21:43  adamfield: same diff
21:43  Tomis: it' a portable imac
21:43  simplicity-: Still not the power of an i7 27"..
21:43  adamfield: no. but i dont need power
21:43  adamfield: all i do is open terminals and 2 VMs
21:43  simplicity-: I dock mine to a power adapter.
21:43  adamfield: 256MB ram each
21:43  simplicity-: lol, power adapter, wrong.
21:44  simplicity-: display or whatever.
21:44  Tomis: the apple display has a power adapter included
21:44  simplicity-: yeah, but i'm not that rich :(
21:44  simplicity-: Just have an 23" Dell IPS monitor :(
21:44  Tomis: get it on refurb
21:45  simplicity-: Not available in my country.
21:45  Tomis: punch 'em
21:47  simplicity-: :)
21:52  pfein: just take the scews out, heh, you ever seen an Air? ;-)

22:47  Tomis: don't use a DMG to distribute your app, just zip it up and throw it on your site
22:47  Tomis: i *hate* DMGs for app distribution, *hate* them
22:48  simplicity-: I don't get why they we're ever introduced? Did apple do it?
22:48  Tomis: the concept of a virtual disk does serve a purpose
22:48  Fenhl: who needs zips
22:48  Tomis: and for some insane reason people started using it to distribute apps
22:49  Tomis: but since apple added zip functionality to the finder, there's no need for it
22:49  Fenhl: it's because you can put a link to the Applications folder in them
22:49  Tomis: no, DMGs are more work and more confusing than anything
22:49  Fenhl: I agree
22:50  Fenhl: still, I think that's why they are used that much
22:50  Tomis: i think it's just herd mentality
22:50  Fenhl: that too
22:50  Tomis: that's how everyone else does it, i guess that's how i'm supposed to do it
22:51  Tomis: the proper way IMO would be to just zip the app, on first run the app checks if it's in the applications folder, asks if you want to move it there, and that's that
22:51  Fenhl: good thing the App Store has a straightforward way of installing apps
22:52  Tomis: except that it makes it convoluted if you already have apps from outside the store
22:52  Tomis: there's no way to easily transition people
22:52  Fenhl: indeed
22:52  Tomis: and it detects installed apps and won't let people purchase them from the store
22:53  Fenhl: for me Coda shows up as "installed" but it doesn't auto-update via the App Store
22:53 * Fenhl is ninja'd
22:53  Tomis: which means angry users wondering why they're not getting updates for your app via the app store
22:53  Tomis: yea, it's retarded, they need to fix it
22:53  Tomis: 10.6.7 is coming soon
22:53  neverblue: anyone want to discuss sharing iTunes libraries between multiple users ?
22:54  Tomis: turn on library sharing in itunes neverblue 
22:54  neverblue: my current setup is, my iMAc, which is connected wirelessly to my LAN, contains all my mp3s
22:54  Tomis: leave itunes running on one computer, other machines can access that library
22:54  neverblue: i have this, so I can update my iphone, etc...
22:55  neverblue: i have home sharing enabled, so when I add new music, it will be visible to all users
22:55  Tomis: if you want to take the approach of accessing the library directly via file sharing, i'd advise not doing so
22:55  Tomis: itunes isn't designed to have multiple instances accessing the same library on disk
22:55  neverblue: Tomis, i actually import my music into a shared location
22:55  neverblue: but nothing else references it
22:55  neverblue: i think this isn't 100%, but the best fix I can come up with
22:56  Tomis: yea, you're using itunes home sharing, then you're done
22:56  neverblue: with that said, ill discuss my issue with it
22:56  neverblue: my user isn't always the first to login, upon reboot
22:56  Tomis: you can sync the changes across machines if you want to keep all the libraries the same
22:56  neverblue: across machines ?
22:56  Tomis: that's one of the features of home sharing, syncing the itunes libraries
22:57  neverblue: right, I see what you mean, after I re-read
22:57  neverblue: but you understand my dilema ?
22:58  Tomis: yea, it's crap no matter what you do
22:58  neverblue: well, i wonder if there is a work around
22:58  neverblue: can I start iTunes, before login?
22:58  Tomis: there isnt' really, all the solutions have their caveots
22:58  neverblue: right, as I have found
22:58  Tomis: itunes isn't designed for a network environment, and they haven't seen fit to add a faceless itunes server
22:59  Tomis: set up a machine to auto login and start itunes at login
22:59  Tomis: that's your best bet
22:59  Tomis: when it's booted up, the other machines will see it
22:59  neverblue: my second option, was to move my library to my Server, which is -almost- always on
23:00  neverblue: but I wonder how that would effect my iphone sync
23:00  Tomis: move the whole library over there
23:00  Tomis: it'll be fine
23:00  neverblue: login, run itunes, logout, all before a user can boot, thats what I was hoping
23:00  Tomis: huh?
23:00  neverblue: s/boot/login/
23:01  neverblue: sorry, I saw what you wrote
23:01  Tomis: if you logout then itunes quits, because you've logout
23:01  neverblue: ah
23:01  neverblue: try
23:01  Tomis: you can't run itunes faceless
23:01  neverblue: so open a login prompt
23:01  neverblue: could automator do such a thing?
23:01  neverblue: applescript ?
23:01  Tomis: huh?
23:02  neverblue: login as my user, open iTunes, open login screen
23:02  Tomis: you'd still need to run itunes under a user account that's logged in
23:02  neverblue: right, which is the 'open iTunes' part
23:02  Tomis: hmm
23:03  Tomis: i'm not sure if it kills the home sharing when you fast user switch
23:03  neverblue: it doesnt
23:03  neverblue: im new to Macs, not computers
23:03  neverblue: i was looking at an option to access my shared drives
23:03  Tomis: well that's pretty crap, lol, why isn't it pausing those user's processes when i switch!
23:03  Tomis: waste of bloody resources
23:03  neverblue: which gave me the chance to use Automator, which didnt end up working
23:04  neverblue: Applescript was the fix
23:04  neverblue: so I don't know the difference between the two, yet
23:04  Tomis: automator is applescript for idiots, essentially
23:04  neverblue: Tomis, same with VMware VMs
23:04  neverblue: they will run
23:04  Tomis: well that's anoying
23:04  neverblue: Tomic the code contained in both, are the same ?
23:04  Tomis: it should pause all those processes
23:05  neverblue: Tomis, I would prefer it to not pause those processes
23:05  Tomis: they both serve essentialy the same purpose
23:05  neverblue: im referring to the syntax
23:05  Tomis: automator is just graphical, instead of having to write a script out
23:05  Tomis: there is no syntax in automator
23:05  neverblue: i used a mount command in Automator
23:06  Tomis: it's a sepperate system than applescript, serving essentially the same purpose
23:06  Tomis: to automate/script things
23:06  neverblue: ok, lets leave it at that
23:06  neverblue: so could it be coded to do this ?
23:06  Wizard: does somebody have xcode installed?
23:06  neverblue: login as user X, run iTunes as user X, login prompt (fast-user switching)
23:07  Wizard: i wonder if latest xcode is still universal
23:07  Tomis: well you'd just be using automator or applescript to run a shell command to switch to the login window somehow
23:07  neverblue: i was more worried about running a script at the time I would like
23:07  Tomis: 3.2.5 is universal, yes Wizard 
23:08  neverblue: finding the commands to run in Terminal might not be that difficult
23:08  Tomis: i'm not messing with xcode 4 until it's out of beta, so no idea there
23:11  Wizard: Tomis: thanks!
23:18  Wizard: hmm, another question
23:19  Wizard: is it possible to use unix server as a storage for time mashine?
23:20  Wizard: i have CentOS workstation, it could backup my mac's home :>
23:25  Tomis: it needs an AFP or NFS server if i remember correctly
23:31  Wizard: Tomis2: i've found pretty detailed tutorial
23:31  Wizard: cool
23:40  superjoe: hey I just got my first mac. How do I fix the mouse acceleration?
23:40  superjoe: the curve feels really unnatural and there doesn't appear to be an option for it in preferences
23:47  ahihi: you'll need a third-party driver
23:47  ahihi: http://www.tidbits.com/article/8893
23:47  mikemac11: changing tracking speed could also help
23:48  superjoe: weak sauce
23:48  ahihi: that doesn't really affect the curve
23:48  superjoe: I looked at MouseFix. it doesn't work for newer OS's
23:48  ahihi: personally I use ControllerMate for this (among a myriad of other things)
23:48  superjoe: that's pretty retarded that you have to pay for 3rd party software to get a mouse that doesn't suck
23:49  ahihi: well, it's entirely subjective
23:49  superjoe: I disagree
23:49  ahihi: plenty of people have no issue with it
23:49  superjoe: all they need is a slider to adjust 1 acceleration parameter
23:49  superjoe: makes a world of difference
23:52 --- ELBeavers is now known as beelers
23:52 --- beelers is now known as ELBeavers
23:52  ahihi: it still wouldn't please everyone :p
23:52  ahihi: you need a 2D editor for total control
23:52  Tomis: why not a curve editor
23:52  Tomis: make all dem nerdz happy
23:52  ahihi: that's what CM provides
23:53  Tomis: maybe i want it to jump from slow as molasis full throttle!
23:53  superjoe: maybe you just need to be able to mess with that ONE parameter, just like windows and linux lets you do
23:55  mikemac11: operating systems are about compromise... you chose os x so prepare to have third party solutions
23:55  Tomis: this is mac os x
23:55  superjoe: I suppose I did choose OS X. In fact my operating system of choice is Ubuntu, but I want my applications to be cross-platform. that means supporting mac os x as well
23:55  Tomis: you are given one option, the perfect option, you will like it
23:56  superjoe: lol
23:56  Tomis: anything else is blasphemy
23:57  ahihi: besides, a few dozen additional bucks don't mean a lot when you consider how much you pay for the actual computer
23:57  superjoe: ahihi, that line of thinking is silly.
23:59  ahihi: it's pragmatic
23:59  superjoe: I see what you did there
