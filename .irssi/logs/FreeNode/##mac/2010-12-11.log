02:33  alexlea: oh ok then..
02:33  LordDragon: Swian, congrats. there should be an update waiting for you to upgrade to 10.6.5 (the latest)
02:33  LordDragon: alexlea, whatcha up to?

02:35  Swian: yeah, downloading now
02:35  LordDragon: alexlea, sounds yummy. cheese?
02:35  Swian: bummer, I can't get a newer version of iTunes on my G4

02:38  Swian: no no, on my G4
02:39  Swian: the mini is my wife's I took her old iMac G4 when she got the mini
02:39  alexlea: hahaha
02:39  alexlea: i like to see that, the woman getting teh NEWer mac :D
02:39  Swian: but it looks like I can download iTunes 10, but its not in software update
02:39  Swian: that's how its always worked here
02:39  alexlea: Swian: thats how it works in my house too
02:39  Swian: my wife gets newere macs
02:39  Swian: but I build my own pcs
02:40  alexlea: these other men here, they give their women the "old "stuff :( bad men, BAD...
02:40  Swian: nope
02:40  Swian: my wife always gets the new mac
02:40  Swian: she just got her iPad too
02:40  Swian: so she's happy
02:41  LordDragon: alexlea, looool. hey you had a new ipod touch for a short time and the bf didnt :P
02:41  alexlea: when it comes to computers, i will always have the better one between me and my bf
02:42  alexlea: he's not into computers annyway
02:47  LordDragon: ah
02:47  LordDragon: thats good
02:48  LordDragon: i could be happy in a jail cell if i could be surround by batteries and computers with internet connectivity :P
02:49  alexlea: i dunno if i could or not
02:49  Swian: nope, too confining
02:52  alexlea: LordDragon: why batteries, wouldnt an outlet be better
02:53  LordDragon: alexlea, cuz i'm obsessed with battries. can never have too many
02:53  alexlea: batteries fr what? 
02:53  LordDragon: alexlea, batteries ALWAYS work. even when the outlet doesnt work
02:53  LordDragon: alexlea, well any type of batteries. i have many varieties here
02:54  LordDragon: for computers, the best batterys are 12volt leadacid so they can power inverters 
02:55  alexlea: but then you have to power the battery...guess you could get a solar panel, and hope to be jailed in southern california with a huge window
02:55  alexlea: lol
02:58  LordDragon: alexlea, well sure. ideally its best to have grid power AND batteries. :)
02:59 * alexlea is reading about rainbow tables
03:00  LordDragon: whats a rainbow table?
03:00  alexlea: not 100% sure, it's something to do with wpa cracking
03:00  LordDragon: ah
03:00  alexlea: but i am not fully understanding how they work
03:00  LordDragon: wpa2?
03:00  LordDragon: or wpa?
03:01  alexlea: not sure about that either, but so far the one i am looking at is wpa only
03:02  LordDragon: wpa2 is more secure
03:02  LordDragon: i use that :)
03:02  LordDragon: and i dare someone to try and crack it :)
03:02  alexlea: if i was in range i would try
03:03  LordDragon: well next time your in new england, let me know and i'll let you try :)
03:04  alexlea: :)
03:04  alexlea: have you ever tried to crck yur netwotk? its fun
03:05  LordDragon: nope. in fact i didnt even know wpa2 was crackable
03:05  alexlea: depends...PSK is
03:05  richardcavell: It's crackable through brute force isn't it?
03:05  alexlea: enterprise wpa2 not so much
03:05  richardcavell: Though it will take time
03:06  alexlea: if PSK is not used, then to just run through every option would take FOREVER
03:06  LordDragon: richardcavell, my key is HUGE. theyd be parked outside my house for months
03:07  alexlea: LordDragon: do you use a passphrase
03:07  LordDragon: alexlea, nope. random generated characters
03:07  richardcavell: Well they could collect the data stream and then process it for months
03:07  alexlea: LordDragon: and they dont have to stay, they just have to capture a handshake...and then can crack it at home
03:08  richardcavell: This is why I'm amazed with WikiLeaks.  Foreign offices spend millions of dollars trying to stop foreign intelligence services from reading *one* message.  Now Julian posts 250,000 of them online
03:08  LordDragon: ok, even if they did that. then theyd have to get by my mac address filtering
03:08  alexlea: LordDragon: with the right equipment, someone can spoof your mac, and interceppt somehow and crck it in less than 20 minutes...
03:09  alexlea: LordDragon: mac address filtering is EASY t get arund
03:09  alexlea: EASY
03:09  alexlea: LordDragon: if  run kismac, it will show me the client mac addies, and i can spoof it within seconds
03:09  alexlea: the ONLY fool proof security is hard wired
03:10  LordDragon: i swear i cant be on IRC without ppl bragging they can hack me EASILY at least once per day :P but none of succeeded yet
03:11  alexlea: LordDragon: i didnt say i could hack you, i said i would "try". the othe rinfo is just facts...mac spoofing is simple
03:11  alexlea: i cant spoof your mac adress cause its 3000 miles away frome me :P
03:11  richardcavell: hard wired with some type of shield
03:11  richardcavell: optic fibre is a good idea
03:12  alexlea: wpa can be cracked, and so can wpa2...more facts. 
03:12  LordDragon: alexlea, i dont mean you. i just mean every day i get ppl telling me how insecure my network is and how they could hack me EASILY if they wanted to
03:12  LordDragon: wpa2 is not easy to crack
03:12  h1ll37: what about that windows 7?
03:12  alexlea: LordDragon: the easites way to hack you would be to break in your house hook up to your router and see the key LOL
03:13  Savior: Hello all, i want a phone that cant play flash, cant make phonecalls, cant multitask and is too big to fit in my pocket, any suggestions?
03:13  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah but then my alarm would go off and id arm myself :P
03:13  richardcavell: you're being silly Savior
03:13  Savior: richardcavell: howso?
03:13  h1ll37: savior: I'd so the iphone probably
03:14  alexlea: LordDragon: the thing is WHO would wanna crack yoru network
03:14  LordDragon: Savior, obvious troll is obvious
03:14  LordDragon: alexlea, i have many enemies
03:14  alexlea: LordDragon: at least your neighbors i mean...maybe enemies on irc would want to, but like, i doubt any know where you live
03:14  h1ll37: LordDragon: obvious troll, using the obvious troll line, is obvious
03:14  Savior: h1ll37: i was thinking i would get the new iboard, it looks revolutionary how they put in 3 usb ports and a serial port!
03:15  LordDragon: unskilled troll is unskilled
03:15  alexlea: LEMONS
03:15  Savior: what is a troll?
03:15  h1ll37: Savior: Yes the iBoard is just what I want. I touch myself when i look at it's picture
03:15  alexlea: LordDragon: i can see why you have many enemeies ;)
03:16  h1ll37: alexlea: Yes he is very rude about accusing people of looking like trolls
03:16  alexlea: Savior: a fisherman...troll=fisherman
03:16  Savior: i got the iphone 6g, it has over 9000 seconds of battery life! u jelly?
03:16  alexlea: h1ll37: he's real nice ince you pass the troll test though :)
03:16  LordDragon: alexlea, yes. standing up against bullies and ppl that are rude does indeed make enemies. many ppl just go with the flow and keep their mouths shut. but not me :D
03:16  richardcavell: I bought a mobile phone that makes phone calls, so that I can make phone calls, and all it does is make phone calls
03:17  richardcavell: It has no camera, no web browser, no Java, no games
03:17  alexlea: LordDragon: you have called me a troll every time i have used a new nick 
03:17  alexlea: LOL
03:17  Savior: i was at the starbucks and this girl walked up to me and asked me to take her home... needless to say it was the phone that got me lucky that night!
03:17  h1ll37: alexlea: What does this test consist of? burning at the stake?
03:18  LordDragon: alexlea, not true! i have suspected your new nicks might be imposters, and so i took precautions for your protection. theres a difference :P better to be viligant!
03:18  alexlea: LordDragon: lol, that was funnt the other day
03:18  h1ll37: Yeah one time i had a droid and i didn't get laid, i blame the droid naturally
03:18  Savior: Hey have you guys heard of the beatles? they are so hip, its awesome that i can get their music from itunes too!
03:18  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah i was watching you like a hawk waiting for you to slip up so i could POUNCE! :P :P
03:18  alexlea: LordDragon: but no i was talking about like a year ago, i was using a different nick....and you called me a troll...i was being kinda obnoxious tho
03:18  LordDragon: h1ll37, dont feed the troll
03:19  Swian: the beatles? I've heard of the Ruttles
03:19  Savior: Steve jerbs really knows how to make revolutionary things like itunes
03:19  h1ll37: My favorite features about iTunes, are not only that it crashes all the time, but it also only allows you to have your ipod on one computer!!! it's the best.
03:19  alexlea: h1ll37: see, you already the lesser evil
03:19  h1ll37: LordDragon: Don't feed the dragon.
03:19  LordDragon: alexlea, well if you were acting like a troll, i was just observing the behavoir pattern
03:20  alexlea: LordDragon: i often get accused of being a troll actually :( whenever i go to new channels
03:20  LordDragon: alexlea, im think h1ll37 is either a troll too, or hes working with Savior.. *ponders*
03:20  LordDragon: er, think = thinking
03:20  Swian: pondering
03:20  Swian: I'm pondering something to eat
03:21  Savior: so can i install Gentoo on the ipad? or do i have to buy something to do it?
03:21  h1ll37: LordDragon: Conspiracy!!! Must burn the dragon at the stake
03:21  Savior: im sure steve will come up with something in time
03:21  h1ll37: Savior: You have to pay $40 everytime you change your wallpaper... can barely imagine the price to change the OS!

03:29  Swian: never an op around when you need one eh?
03:30  Savior: Why would you need ops? you cant take care of a "fail troll" yourself?

03:30  h1ll37: Why does my Mac keep getting the Blue Screen of death?
03:30  LordDragon: Swian, indeed. or perhaps the ops are around, but find the obvious trolls amusing. some ops are like that
03:30  Savior: h1ll37: cause thats what steve wants
03:30  alexlea: LordDragon: this isnt #macosx, they have always been a little stricter in here
03:30  h1ll37: Savior: WHY IS STEVE SO MEAN :O /cry
03:31  alexlea: which is why i never used to like it here
03:31  LordDragon: alexlea, i think i really upset the troll with my "obvious troll insult". hes been going on about it for like 2 hours now :P

03:33  Swian: feels better already
03:33  LordDragon: ChrisAM, lol
03:33  alexlea: DarkStar1: when, after the installation? or before
03:33  DarkStar1: at start
03:34  Swian: virtualbox has been less than stable since sun took over
03:34  Swian: or oracle
03:34  DarkStar1: I get a coutdown to skip or enter startup.nsh
03:34  Swian: sorry
03:34  alexlea: DarkStar1: um...not sure when you are referring to, 1. mount iso or cd drive with ubuntu 2. make vm machine 3. boot it 4 install 5 reboot...where is it messing up
03:35  LordDragon: DarkStar1, how ar eyou installing ubuntu? did you use their .iso? 10.10?
03:35  DarkStar1: yeah downloaded 10.10 32 bit
03:35 @ChrisAM: I'm not really paying attention right now, but if there's more trouble, just highlight my nick
03:35  alexlea: DarkStar1: if you have already installed, and its booting , but all you have is a black screen try typing start
03:35  alexlea: startx *
03:36  LordDragon: alexlea, with modern ubuntu you shouldnt have to do that. its supposed to go into the window manager automatically
03:36  alexlea: LordDragon: right when all goes well...
03:36  alexlea: but like i use backtrack, and i have to type fixvesa and startx every time
03:37  alexlea: DarkStar1: http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox its for windows, but shoudl work the same way
03:37  LordDragon: DarkStar1, did you set the iso to be your cdrom boot drive?
03:38  DarkStar1: Yeah I did
03:38  DarkStar1: I get an EFI shell screen instead of installation screen
03:38  alexlea: ???
03:39  DarkStar1: what's the screen capture sequence of keys so that  i can show you?
03:39  alexlea: shift command 3 
03:39  LordDragon: DarkStar1, COMMAND SHIFT 3
03:39  LordDragon: alexlea, wrong! :P command shift!
03:39  alexlea: LordDragon: i hold them all down at onc
03:40  LordDragon: alexlea, i know. im just being silly

03:42  DarkStar1: http://imgur.com/afqXR
03:42  Swian: mine did too
03:42  LordDragon: DarkStar1, ok it looks from the screenshot like vbox isnt booting off your ubuntu iso
03:43  alexlea: weirdness
03:43  alexlea: DarkStar1: have you even booted the cd at all?
03:43  DarkStar1: nope. Guessing I need an EFI enabled ubuntu version?
03:43  alexlea: DarkStar1: no, you dont
03:43  alexlea: DarkStar1: ok so your issue is in creating the machine, etc
03:43  DarkStar1: I tried of a 64bit ubuntu the other day and got nowhere
03:44  alexlea: DarkStar1:  you need to create a new vm, vbox has a wizard,
03:44  alexlea: DarkStar1: then, you need to attach the ubuntu iso to the vm
03:46  DarkStar1: that seems to have done it... thanks
03:48  alexlea: yw
03:49  Swian: wish I had some wine
03:49  alexlea: buy some
03:49  Swian: I will tomorrow
03:49  Swian: but I have crackers and cheese now
03:49  alexlea: i prefer pot
03:50  Swian: I used to back when
03:50  alexlea: not a big fan of alcohol
03:50  Swian: things change
03:50  Swian: I felt the same when I was in my 20s
03:50  alexlea: alcohol makes me feel horrible and it makes me sick
03:51  alexlea: pot doesn't... i only do it a few times a year...
03:52  alexlea: when i was in my 20's i hated pot...lol
03:52  Swian: when I was my 20's I smoked a lot of pot
03:52  alexlea: i only do one-2 hits when i do it
03:53  alexlea: ijust like to be slightly buzzed..
03:53  Swian: how often do you do that?
03:53  alexlea: um, about a month ago i did that about  5 times over the course of 2 weeks...and thats the only time i have smoked this calndar year
03:53  Swian: restraint
03:54  Swian: I used to smoke about an 1/8 a day
03:54  alexlea: i wouldnt call it restraint, because i dont have to make myself hold back...i do it as much as i want...i just rarely want it..and when i do, i want very little
03:54  alexlea: alcohol though, is bad...i take 1 sip and i pretty much will dirnk til i pass out...its like i cant hlp myself once i start
03:55  Swian: I can maintain
03:55  Swian: don't need to get blasted

03:55  alexlea: i always think i can...but inevitibly, i get carried away, etc...I am that person who dances on teh table with teh lampshade
03:55  osxdude: Swian: Colloquy.
04:00  DarkStar1: same
04:00  DarkStar1: But there's one thing about it I hate
04:01  DarkStar1: once you auto join a room you can't remove that room from auto join ever again
04:02  DarkStar1: Well at least with Colloquy on the OSX that is
04:05  alexlea: DarkStar1: yes you can, click server properties, and uncheck it or remove it fom list
04:05  Swian: I prefer XChat
04:05  Swian: but to each his/her own
04:06  alexlea: lately i prefer limechat
04:07  alexlea: http://cl.ly/350N3a2n2z2v0s350m2K
04:07  alexlea: screenshot of my limechat, with my theme that i made myself
04:08  Swian: looks fairly close to xchat
04:09  alexlea: only complaint i have about xchat is you cant theme the sidebars
04:09  DarkStar1: alexlea:  What version of colloquy are you using because I can't find that option on mine
04:10  alexlea: DarkStar1: i'm using limechat not colloquy
04:10  DarkStar1: alexlea: well that option you mentioned doesn't exist with colloquy?
04:10  Swian: I don't really need a theme, the colors can be changed a bit
04:11  alexlea: DarkStar1: oh you mean the autojoin, that is on colloquy...
04:11  DarkStar1: alexlea:  Yeah..
04:11  alexlea: DarkStar1: um, you click something in the menu that brings down the server list, then you ctrl click the server, and it lets you change properties
04:12  DarkStar1: alexlea: No such thing..
04:12  alexlea: DarkStar1: yes there is...one sec, i will figure out how to explain it to you
04:12  alexlea: i used to use colloquy all the time
04:13  DarkStar1: alexlea:  I can see the server list and the auto join list isn't anywhere to be seen
04:13  alexlea: i am dl-ing colloquy so i can guuide you, one sex
04:13  alexlea: sec*
04:14  DoFoT9: mmmnnnnn sex
04:14 --- LaraCroft is now known as LaraX
04:16  alexlea: DarkStar1: ok, click window on the colloqy menu bar
04:16  alexlea: then click connections
04:16  alexlea: then right click or cntrol click the server, ie irc.freenode.net
04:17  alexlea: and choose get info
04:17  alexlea: then click the tab that says automatic
04:17  DarkStar1: alexlea: thanks.. I gave up months ago... Talk about well buried
04:18  alexlea: in that get info tab, i always checked open console on launch, cause back when i used it, my irc window would never coe up on its own
04:18  alexlea: thats when i stumbled on that automatic tab, etc
04:26  its-me-again: hi all 
04:26  DarkStar1: OSX has the equivalent of workspaces right??
04:26  its-me-again: do all macbookair computers nolonger come with cd/dvd drives 
04:26  DarkStar1: they never did
04:26  its-me-again: DarkStar1: yes its unix baised 
04:27  its-me-again: DarkStar1: um i seem one that did 
04:27  DarkStar1: you always had to buy them so far as I know
04:28  DarkStar1: I've never seen one sporting an optical drive.. unless it's ne of those chinese copies :P
04:30  its-me-again: DarkStar1: ok but macbook air are more environmentally frendly in construction, adn parts than macbook or macbook pro.  macbook air could easily have a cd rom and stillbe just as slim and light 
04:30  its-me-again: how do you update macbook air computers then. i never dseen new software apps etc come on usb stick. 
04:31  DarkStar1: I agree with you.. In fact I'd probably have one since I've only tried to use my optical drive once since I bought this mbp (my 1st mac)
04:31  DarkStar1: however... I've always found them lacking in grunt
04:32  DarkStar1: I bought the mbp because it came with 4GB RAM and had a decent GPU for a 13" laptop
04:32  alexlea: its-me-again: they never had optical drives. 2 you use an external optical drive, or you you use the optical drive of another mac, and hook them together some weird way, or you copy the software onto usb with another computer, or oyu just direct dl your software

06:35  Blink7: I currently own a 24" cinema display which is just perfect, but I need another one for in the office
06:35  leplacs: dell
06:36  Blink7: the handy plug that comes with a cinema display and works great together with a macbook, how would that work with another brand? do they come with a similar plug?
06:38  leplacs: minidisplay port?
06:38  leplacs: i think it's on my 27" dell
06:38  leplacs: ill check
06:43  Blink7: leplacs: which Dell are you using?
06:43  leplacs: u2711
06:45  Kasm279: Blink7: most non-appl emonitors don't have the mini displayport
06:45  Blink7: Kasm279: is there a converter or something?
06:45  Kasm279: but you should have gotten an adaptor to DVI in the box
06:45  Kasm279: i think
06:45  Kasm279: yeah
06:45  Kasm279: the mini displayport outputs DVI and VGA
06:45  Blink7: okay
06:45  Kasm279: some Macs also do component and svideo thoguh the port iirc
06:47  Blink7: Kasm279: leplacs: hmm the Dell u2711 is not really cheaper than the Cinema Display
06:48  Blink7: is it better or why didn't you buy a Cinema Display, leplacs ?
06:48  leplacs: there is a cheap 24"
06:48  leplacs: this has a higher pixel depth
06:48  leplacs: like the macbook pro
06:48  leplacs: and it is HDCP-compliant ;)
06:48  leplacs: for the playback of bluray movies
06:49  leplacs: you can get very cheap 24" dells
06:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v marienz]
06:52  Blink7: okay, thanks leplacs
06:52  leplacs: np
06:55  leplacs: oh i didn't buy the cinema display because it has a smaller screen and it has less inputs
06:56  leplacs: my dell has display port, hdmi, 2 x dvi, component
06:56  leplacs: and a usb hub
06:56  leplacs: and i don't know about the cinema display but this one has sRGB and Adobe RGB calibration built in
06:58 +Branes: Blink7: The reason why the Cinema and the closest Dell monitors are almost identical in price, is that they use the same expensive, high-precision LCD technology, S-IPS.
06:59  Blink7: Branes: thanks, i always thought that Dell was a very cheap brand, didn't know that they also made good stuff hehe
06:59  leplacs: u2711 doesn't have led though
07:00  Blink7: okay
07:00  Blink7: i'm looking for something that's almost identical to the 24" cinema display that I currently own, just cheaper
07:01  Blink7: what about a Samsung Syncmaster?
07:01  Velociraptors: Blink7:  identical as in case look, or just a same size similar quality screen?
07:02  Blink7: Velociraptors: similar quality of the screen, so switching between the cinema display that I have at home and the one at the office won't be too much of a difference, preferably exactly the same types of screen, the way it looks does not really matter
07:03 +Branes: Blink, there are three types of LCD technology -- TN Film (cheap, inaccurate), MVA, which is what Samsung use (accurate colour, slightly blurry, slow, average price) and IPS (expensive, fast, true colour)
07:04  mrapple: anyone who's awesome at css here? :D
07:04 +Branes: Dell Ultrasharp monitors represent excellent value against the Cinemas, they sport the same displays, and have a wider range of plugs
07:04  Blink7: mrapple: I code lots of CSS, might be able to help you
07:04  mrapple: Any idea why the text is cut off in the #right? -> http://projects.bzextreme.com/projects/
07:05  Blink7: Branes: thanks, so adding IPS as a criteria will lead me to something that's very similar to the Cinema Display 24"
07:05  Blink7: what about LED?
07:05  Kasm279: LED is the backlighting technology
07:05 +Branes: Yes Blink
07:06  Blink7: thanks Branes, Kasm279
07:06 +Branes: LED backlighting is brighter than the older CCFL backlights. That can be annoying for some people.
07:06  Blink7: mrapple, why aren't you using floats?
07:06  mrapple: because i dont need to
07:06  leplacs: LED is instant-on
07:07  mrapple: don't worry Blink7 it looks reallly ugly right now. just working on the layout ;)
07:08  Blink7: mrapple: but what are you trying to do? the right is currently set at 100%
07:08  mrapple: im trying to get it to be 100%, minus 200pixles
07:08  mrapple: pixels
07:09  Blink7: ah
07:09  mrapple: :D
07:09  Blink7: the easiest way would be to give left a width of 20% and right a width of 80%
07:09  mrapple: that's how i had it...
07:09  Blink7: the second way would be what you're doing right now with the z-index, but just set a padding/margin to the left on #right
07:10  mrapple: but i want left static width
07:10  Blink7: okay
07:10  Blink7: uhms put a container in you're #right
07:10  Blink7: so another <div id="inner">Text</div>
07:10  mrapple: what will that do?
07:10  Blink7: give it a padding-left:210px;
07:11  mrapple: that seems like cheating ;)
07:11  Blink7: why?
07:11  Blink7: you're right is set to 100%; you won't be able to add a margin/padding there
07:13 * mrapple uses 20%, 80%
07:13  mrapple: night ;)
07:13  mrapple: thanks for your help
07:14  Blink7: mrapple: no problem
07:24  Colloguy: I need a calendar app that is free, cross-platform (i.e. not iCal), private (i.e. not google calendar), and doesn't need to be running to show alerts (i.e. not Sunbird, Lightning). Any recommendations? :P

15:19  rubydiamond: is is possible to get unlocked iphone 4 
15:19  rubydiamond: in US
15:19  rubydiamond: someway
15:20  deever: rubydiamond: i think so, yes
15:20  rubydiamond: deever: hmm
15:20  rubydiamond: where ?
15:20  rubydiamond: deever: do you have some link
15:20 * deever shrugs
15:20  rubydiamond: deever: hmm
15:21  deever: dunno...i'm not in the US...;)
15:21  rubydiamond: Anybody from US here ?
15:30  rubydiamond: Anybody know whether unlocked iPhone 4 is available in US
15:30  rubydiamond: or not
15:37  Swian: I'm in the us, but don't have an iPhone
15:48  FriedBob: Given that AT&T still has an exclusive contract, they won't unlock it, so unless you can unlock it by jailbreaking it - I doubt it
15:49 +Tomis: there are no unlocked iphone sold in the US yet rubydiamond 
15:49 +Tomis: you'd have to get one imported, or go on a little holiday
15:49  rubydiamond: Tomis: Some ppl here in India unofficially / illegally bring those from US to Inda
15:49  rubydiamond: India*
15:49  rubydiamond: Tomis: I just confirmed with one of the shop owner here
15:49 +Tomis: unlocked iphones aren't sol in the US
15:49  rubydiamond: he said he has one around $900
15:49  rubydiamond: Tomis: yeah
15:49 +Tomis: flat out, not sold
15:50 +Tomis: so they'd have to be from some other market
15:50  rubydiamond: Tomis: but somehow ppl might be getting those to US from UK
15:50  rubydiamond: or some another country
15:50 +Tomis: up
15:50 +Tomis: err, yup
15:50  rubydiamond: Tomis: if I buy such factory unlocked iPhone 4
15:50  rubydiamond: what is my loss
15:50 +Tomis: a factory unlocked one? no issues
15:51  rubydiamond: Tomis: I am getting one in India around $900
15:51  rubydiamond: for 16GB
15:51 +Tomis: an after-market hacked one? could be bricked or relocked with any osftware update
15:51  rubydiamond: Tomis: box packed
15:51  rubydiamond: should I go ahead and buy it
15:51  rubydiamond: price is little hight
15:51  rubydiamond: high*
15:51 +Tomis: if they're saying it's unlocked and from the US, i wouldn't
15:51  rubydiamond: I heard it's for $650 elsewhere
15:51  rubydiamond: Tomis: I will confirm that
15:52  rubydiamond: Tomis: they say it's box packed
15:52  rubydiamond: and they will open in front of me

15:52  rubydiamond: Tomis: they also tell that it's from US :(
15:52 +Tomis: yea forget that, there aren't unlocked iphones sold in the US
15:53  rubydiamond: Tomis: right
15:53  rubydiamond: Tomis: how to confirm phone is made in which country
15:53  rubydiamond: I can check that on box right ?
15:53 +Tomis: good question
15:53  rubydiamond: is there anything that I should verify
15:53 +Tomis: i've no idea, a bit of googling may reveal something that would break down info based on the serial number
15:53  FriedBob: Aren't they all made in China, just made for sale in different countries/regions?
15:54 +Tomis: yes FriedBob 
15:54  rubydiamond: FriedBob: yeah

16:42  b0o-yeah: it also doesn't help that my campus has a new block of IPs and the library never bothered adding them to the access list
16:43 +Tomis: what?
16:43 +Tomis: how could the wifi be handing out IPs not on its access list
16:43 +Tomis: very silly
16:44  b0o-yeah: not really ... the library manually tells the journals what IPs are allowed
16:44  b0o-yeah: the library and IT don't always work together
16:44  cryptic0: it's ridiculous
16:44  b0o-yeah: well yes it is that

22:34  S_SubZero: hi
22:36  Miles: in firmware i see two cpus but osx sees one, what could cause that?
22:38  S_SubZero: what Mac do you have?
22:38  Miles: power g5
22:39  Miles: i think maybe the wrong firmware is installed. searching for the version says "uniprocessor"
22:39  Miles: but it won't let me install a different version, says it's up to date.
22:39  S_SubZero: the older macs are outside my knowledge
22:39  Miles: but i see cpu0, cpu1 in the open firmware terminal so idk
22:39  Miles: ah
22:47  iaj: Someone in here using irssi and can tell me a nice script that enables growl notifying?
22:47  torchie_pre: is that possible?
22:48 --- Brisk` is now known as Brisk
22:49  iaj: I think so
22:50  iaj: Theres even a growl_notify.sh script for Mac OSX -- hence I could get trigger.pl and create something.. but I'd be interested if someone could lend me a hand
22:59  Swian: ordered myself a mac mini for Xmas, I've been good this year
23:00  MultiFinder: :D
23:00  MultiFinder: Mac mini!
23:01  Swian: older one, but good for me
23:01 * MultiFinder pets his that he got the day after the first Nvidia ones came out
23:05 @crilly: Swian: Nice :)
23:07  MultiFinder: Swian: What're the specs?
23:07  Miles: yeah it looks like the wrong firmware has been flashed \:
23:07  Miles: and it does not allow an older version to be restored..
23:07  Miles: that kinda sucks
23:15 --- thespider is now known as rustymyers
23:32  Miles: maybe there's a way of fooling it into thinking the old firmware is newer than the installed version..
23:49  SuspectZero: hey there, quick question, hopefully you guys can help me out. i have an ipod 5.5g 80gb video. i would like to downgrade the firmware to an older firmware but i dont know where to get the older firmware installer. does anyone have a quick link possibly?
