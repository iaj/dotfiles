01:09  ichdertom: joekv: depends what that something is
01:10  joekv: I just moved a video in a browser to the external and when I go full screen it comes back to the macbook display
01:10  ichdertom: quicktime has a setting
01:10  ichdertom: that it stays fullscreen
01:11  joekv: this is in a browser tho
01:11  ichdertom: well i'm afraid that won't work
01:11  joekv: k

01:14  joekv: http://veetle.com/index.php/channel/view#4c58536d41cfb
01:14  joekv: it makes you install their player

02:20  ivo_: by a new laptop
02:20  ivo_: the mbp is probably broken
02:20  remyo: nownot: http://www.google.com/search?q=speed+up+firefox+os+x
02:20  ivo_: :D
02:20  remyo: nownot: What version of Firefox are you running?
02:21  nownot: 3.6.10
02:21  ivo_: 3.6.10 is running fine here
02:22  ivo_: so your mbp must be broken
02:22  nownot: ivo_: please stop being uselss, thanks
02:22  remyo: nownot: Do you have any addons? Have you tweaked any settings? Or is it a raw installation? 
02:23  nownot: disabled all add ons but 1passwd and adbock+
02:23  remyo: Try disabling adblock
02:23  nownot: like techcrunch takes days to load
02:23  remyo: The way a lot of them work is check against a list which slows things down a lot
02:24  Branes: Try using a browser that is *not* Firepig.
02:25  remyo: I kind of agree with Branes though 
02:25  ivo_: so wht use Suxfari
02:25  ivo_: :D
02:25  nownot: thats seems to make it alot better 
02:25  remyo: nownot: Disabling adblock?
02:25  nownot: ya
02:25  remyo: I knew it
02:26  nownot: damn it
02:26  remyo: nownot: What are the alternatives to adblock?
02:26  nownot: no pron websites?
02:29  remyo: Branes: Speaking of browsers. What do you run on your older Macs?
02:29  remyo: The pre-Safari ones
02:29  Branes: I don't.
02:30  Psy: does anyone know an application that allows you to redirect the sound output of an app ?
02:30  remyo: Branes: You just browse on one?
02:30  Branes: There's Classilla, and an older Wamcom mozilla, and iCab ... but I do all my internetting from the headless G4.
02:31  remyo: Psy: SoundSource? http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/
02:31  Branes: Psy: There's a few, actually. jackosx, SoundFlower, AudioHijack
02:32  Psy: remyo: doesn't seem I can chose per application
02:32  remyo: I'm not sure if you're just trying to redirect it or capture it, Psy 
02:32  Branes: remyo: I like the idea of being able to hide one window and have *all* of my internet stuff out of distraction's way :)
02:32  remyo: Ahhh.
02:32  Psy: Branes: audio hijack allows me to record the sound of an ap
02:32  remyo: Branes: Good idea
02:32  Psy: I want to redirect it
02:33  Psy: for example I want safari to output in my screen speakers and itunes in my headphones
02:34  Branes: I don't believe you can use more than one physical output at once.
02:34  Psy: so why can I chose different outputs in iChat and Skype ?
02:34  Psy: (and different inputs as well)
02:35  Branes: The headphone output and the speakers are a single device. It's a different story if you're using USB-based headphones.
02:35  Psy: I'm in the different story
02:35  Branes: Have a look at jackosx, it may be useful to you.
02:35  Psy: ok thanks
03:17  fleebailey33: Branes: whats different from that and soundflower?
03:18  Branes: jackosx is both crossplatform and much more powerful
03:18  fleebailey33: cool
03:18  fleebailey33: hmm

04:56  floydfanx6: ?
04:56  EdLin: floydfanx6: you can always convert flacs to Apple Lossless, and play them on your iPod.
04:56  Kasm279: floydfanx6: no
04:56  floydfanx6: lolllllll
04:56  floydfanx6: its not the same
04:56  Kasm279: my device uses a microSD card
04:56  floydfanx6: u loose quality
04:57  Kasm279: (nintendo DS lite)
04:57  floydfanx6: i am into wave lengths and music quality
04:57  EdLin: floydfanx6: apple lossless is the same as flac as far as quailty goes.
04:57  floydfanx6: im not here for that
04:57  floydfanx6: no its not
04:57  floydfanx6: im sorry to say

04:57  floydfanx6: no my freind
04:57  floydfanx6: im telling u...
04:57  floydfanx6: i thought the same as u
04:58  rottenrecords: you don't understand what lossless means then
04:58  floydfanx6: until someone told me i was wrong and i experimented
04:58  floydfanx6: i do
04:58  floydfanx6: its lossless when ripped to the flac
04:58  rottenrecords: then you have a faulty apple lossless decoderf
04:58  floydfanx6: correct
04:58  floydfanx6: btu then when u convert to mp3
04:58  floydfanx6: u are losing stuff
04:58  rottenrecords: mp3 isn't lossless
04:58  floydfanx6: sorry to tell u
04:58  EdLin: mp3 != Apple Lossless.
04:58  rottenrecords: you're an idiot
04:59  Kasm279: learn to spell floydfanx6
04:59  floydfanx6: when u listen to a flac directly it always sounds better then a flac converted to the 320 format
04:59  EdLin: floydfanx6: what does that have to do with Apple Lossless?
04:59  floydfanx6: i dont know much about apple lossless
04:59  floydfanx6: to be honest
04:59  EdLin: that's clear

05:04  Tomis: it's always been this way
05:04  Tomis: you can have as many ipods synced to a machine as you want
05:04  floydfanx6: so yr sayin it should work
05:04  floydfanx6: ty tomis
05:04  floydfanx6: very much
05:04  Tomis: the new ipod may require a new version of itunes though
05:04  floydfanx6: and rotten
05:04  Tomis: so you may have no choice there
05:04  Tomis: upgrade itunes
05:04  floydfanx6: i cant
05:04  Tomis: or use it with your own machine instead of hers
05:04  floydfanx6: all the good music is on her machine
05:04  floydfanx6: i put on
05:04  floydfanx6: lol
05:04  rottenrecords: that's sharing
05:04  S_SubZero: rottenrecords: why did they use Windows for the screenshots? o.O
05:04  Tomis: so put it on your machine?
05:05  rottenrecords: that is illegal
05:05  rottenrecords: because I'm on windows
05:05  rottenrecords: and the website knows
05:05  floydfanx6: anywaysy ty
05:05  rottenrecords: i have an OS X skin though
05:05  rottenrecords: i guess that didn't fool apple's website
05:05  EdLin: floydfanx6: take a small hard drive, or flash drive if the collection is small enough, and copy it over.
05:05  EdLin: floydfanx6: then import it into your machine
05:06  Tomis: or just connect the ipod to the machine and sync it
05:06  Tomis: if it doesn't work, get the newest version
05:06  rottenrecords: won't that delete all your current music?
05:07  Tomis: he said it's a new ipod
05:07  rottenrecords: oh, right
05:07  Tomis: so it doesn't matter if it wipes it anyway
05:07  floydfanx6: how do i import it into my machine
05:07  floydfanx6: ?
05:07  floydfanx6: i can make a folder
05:08  ldiamond: I have a time capsule with a printer connect to it through USB. There is an option to share it to WAN. Is there a way to do this with a password protection?
05:08  floydfanx6: how can i import that to the ipod nano
05:08  floydfanx6: without itunes
05:08  floydfanx6: ?
05:08  Tomis: you need itunes floydfanx6 
05:08  floydfanx6: i know
05:08  floydfanx6: but
05:08  Tomis: then use itunes
05:08  floydfanx6: my girlfreind doesnt wanna upgrade
05:08  Tomis: tough
05:08  floydfanx6: because shes uses floola
05:08  floydfanx6: and they dont have a newer version of floolla for the newer itunes
05:09  floydfanx6: i think

05:09  Tomis: because you need to use itunes
05:09  floydfanx6: no u dont
05:09  floydfanx6: u can use floola
05:09  Tomis: yes, you do

05:11  ldiamond: Tomis, I see that, but when I check the Share printer over WAN option, there's no password setting...
05:11  Tomis: then there isn't one
05:12  Tomis: you could set up a VPNi guess

05:49  jedivulcan: Don't expect anything to run on a MacBook without at least a 9400m
05:50  key: I got the 2GB ram model
05:53  jedivulcan: If you're on a 2008 unibody MacBook... yeah, I have a mid-2009 13" MacBook Pro... so it's roughly the same; cept firewire and SD... but I know Steam games run decently on mine.
05:53  jedivulcan: Nothing fantastic. 
05:53  jedivulcan: Source games I mean.
05:55  key: I don't know if I have the unibody
05:55  key: I got it summer of 2008
05:55  key: It was latest at the time. It's the all white plastic
05:55  key: 2.4 Ghz core 2 duo
05:55  key: 2gb of ram
05:56  key: I have under graphics listed: Intel GMA X3100
05:56  key: VRAM (total) says 144
05:57  jedivulcan: Nah, you don't have the unibody. Those are the aluminum ones. 
05:58  key: Oh
05:58  key: So what will this Macbook run?
05:58  jedivulcan: As far as Steam games go... probably nothing... maybe Portal.
05:58  jedivulcan: Anything that isn't Nvidia or ATI are unsupported.
05:59  key: What about AoE 2?
06:01  jedivulcan: No clue. It should run it if the game is older than your MacBook.
06:01  jedivulcan: I just meant newer stuff... probably couldn't get Half Life 2 or anything like that running without some hassle.
06:01  jedivulcan: and if it 's on Steam, it might stop you before you can run it.
06:02 --- Cam is now known as Guest62017
06:02  key: I wonder if my Macbook could run AOE3 then? Since it's odler than the Macbook
06:02  key: It seems to be from 2006
06:04  jedivulcan: Likely... you meet minimum specs.
06:06  Ballresin: Test....
06:12  key: Whoa, Age of Empires Online looks awesome!
06:12  key: I wish it was out
06:15  Kasm279: key: Age Of Empires 2 ftw :P
06:15  Ballresin: Irc channel to find jobs?
06:15  key: Kasm279: Why do you say?
06:15  Kasm279: key: Age Of Empires 2 ftw :P
06:15  key: I just started downloading AOE3
06:15  key: Yes, WHY do you say
06:15  Kasm279: oh
06:15  Kasm279: all three of them are epic
06:16  Kasm279: i like AoE 2 the best though
06:16  key: Why do you like 2 over 3?
06:16  Kasm279: i dunno
06:16  Kasm279: i haven't really played 3 as mugh though so
06:17  Kasm279: i should install FSX
06:17  Kasm279: see how it handles on this machine
06:18  key: FSX?
06:22  Ballresin: Any ios devs in here?
06:23  Ballresin: Real Q... Anyone played with iPad on ios 4?
06:23  key: I dev iOS
06:23  Ballresin: Under NDA?
06:24  key: No
06:24  key: Why would you even ask me that
06:24  Ballresin: Many devs are. I used to be.
06:25  Bensawsome: osxdude_ >_>
06:25  Bensawsome: lol nda
06:25  Tomis: isn't iOS 4 for iPad already out?
06:25  Ballresin: Nope.
06:25  Jarvis: not yet
06:25  Tomis: well then why buy one
06:26  Tomis: that's silly
06:26  Ballresin: Just got my iPad yesterday.
06:26  Tomis: the ipad can't even mutlitask right now?
06:26  Ballresin: No.
06:26  Tomis: pointless, it'll never sell
06:26  Ballresin: Ha
06:26  Tomis: apple's clearly doomed
06:26  jedivulcan: iOS 4 makes iPad useful.
06:27  jedivulcan: Even if it's a limited form of multitasking... have an always accessible, fast switch bar helps a lot.
06:27  jedivulcan: I've used my iPad A LOT more on 4.2 than on 3.2
06:27  Ballresin: I can't wait. I'd like to leave irc open and open safari...
06:27  Ballresin: Wish I still had my dev account paid up.
06:27  jedivulcan: There's a 10 minute rule for IRC like Colloquy mobile
06:28  Ballresin: What about bouncer? Push keep it alive?
06:29  Ballresin: Wow, just noticed the bumps on the F and J keys on the iPad keyboard. Why, Steve, why?
06:29  osxdude_: o_o Bensawsome 
06:29  osxdude_: Bensawsome: not yet
06:29  osxdude_: hahaha

06:30  Bensawsome: osxdude upload faster!!!!!
06:30  Bensawsome: lol
06:31  key: Bumps on a virtual keyboard? what's the point
06:31  Ballresin: Xactly.
06:32  osxdude: Bensawsome: lol
06:32  osxdude: key: none
06:32  osxdude: lol
06:32  Ballresin: Learning floaty fingers is a bit challenging, but can type pretty quickly on it...
06:33  Branes: its a visual navigating aid.
06:33  Ballresin: Oh, hi Branes. Yes, i suppose.
06:35  Branes: For touch typists -- who more often than not look at the keyboard to position their hands over it before typing -- it triggers the reticular activation system of the brain that's already learned the visual cue meaning "hands go *here*".
06:35  osxdude: o.o
06:39  Ballresin: In the time it takes my iPad to go from 20% battery to 15, my Droid can nearly shed it's entire charge.
06:40  EdLin: Ballresin: your iPad is a 3g or wifi iPad?
06:40  Ballresin: I will be exceedingly happy if VZW gets iPhone 4.
06:40  Ballresin: Wifi.
06:40  EdLin: Ballresin: well, 3g radios are a big battery drain, so it's not really a fair comparison.
06:41  Ballresin: That Drooiiiid noise might be too... Piece of junk.
06:41  EdLin: Ballresin: put that droid on wifi only, it'll last nearly as long. ;-)
06:42  Ballresin: And still be less than a quarter as useful.
06:42  EdLin: Ballresin: well, yes, that's because it's a phone.
06:42  EdLin: Ballresin: an iPhone needs a nightly charge too.
06:42 --- Guest62017 is now known as Cam
06:42  Cam: Ballresin?
06:42  Cam: Fantastic name.
06:42  Ballresin: I've had a very poor experience with Android overall.
06:43  Ballresin: Thx
06:43  jeremyw: My Droid is money.  Lasts forever.
06:43  jeremyw: I mean, I throttled some of the auto refresh settings for apps, knowing that would have an impact and all.
06:43  jeremyw: Common sense really.
06:43  S_SubZero: My Droid Incredible and iPhone 3GS have similar battery life.
06:43  Bensawsome: ima get me a droid x
06:44  jeremyw: See...Apple doesn't want you to have to think, nor does it give you the option to, while the Droid doesn't make you think but depending on what you install and how you configure it, you might need to.
06:44  Ballresin: I think exchange push hurts it badly.
06:44  jeremyw: Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
06:44  EdLin: I have an HTC HD2, it lasts pretty well. 24 hours easily, though only 9 when I run Android on it. 
06:44  EdLin: but it wasn't meant to run Android.... :)
06:45  Ballresin: Dual boot to win ce?
06:45  EdLin: yep
06:45  jeremyw: My Droid and 3GS have similar batary times too S_SubZero.
06:45  EdLin: I had a cliq XT before it, it had mediocre battery life.
06:45  EdLin: it was a pure Android phone
06:45  Ballresin: My iPhone 2g has better battery life than my droid.
06:45  EdLin: well, as pure as Motoblur was.
06:46  EdLin: Ballresin: your non-3g iPhone doesn't have a 3g radio.
06:46  Ballresin: Oh............
06:46  EdLin: EDGE connections use less battery.
06:46  Ballresin: Thx
06:47  jeremyw: And I'm sure your Droid has N number of apps updating quite frequently.
06:47  Ballresin: Imagine... 50% more G costs us dearly.
06:47  EdLin: the iPhone 4 does have good battery life though, not as good as Galaxy S, but I'm not a big fan of SuperAMOLED.
06:47  Ballresin: I killed all my apps on my droid so it will survive a day on standby, so long as it doesn't get used,
06:48  thedonvaughn: the 3GS, after iOS 4, has horrible battery life.  And yes I make sure to stop background apps
06:48  EdLin: a Galaxy S android phone only needs to be charged every 48 hours, which is pretty awesome for a smartphone.
06:48  Ballresin: Suck... I've got mail, but can't check it without killing irc...
06:48  EdLin: only thing that does better is Blackberry, but Blackberrys aren't very good at web or media.
06:49  EdLin: Ballresin: what IRC program are you using? I use Andchat, works fine in the background.
06:49  EdLin: or are you on the iPad?
06:49  Ballresin: I'm on iPad
06:49  key: Hey guys, http://sillysoft.net/vox/ is actually a pretty good turn-based RTS
06:49  EdLin: oh. :)
06:50  EdLin: I'd really like to get an iPad, but I just can't justify it.
06:50  Ballresin: Looking for a good IDE for iPad...
06:50  EdLin: Ballresin: someone at #macosx, jer I think, is working on a programming environment for iPad.
06:50  Ballresin: I kinda need it for dev, but it has been great for lots of things for 24 hours.
06:51  EdLin: Ballresin: the only way to program an iPad now is with Xcode and the iPhone SDK.
06:51  Ballresin: Need to get a keyboard if thats the case.
06:51  Ballresin: No, php dev
06:51  EdLin: you're going to write PHP using an iPad?!
06:51  Ballresin: Maybe. If it doesn't
06:51  Ballresin: Suck
06:52  EdLin: you'll need to get a real keyboard. I don't know if it has any decent text editors for programming on it.
06:52  Ballresin: Yeah, real keyboard is a must.
06:52  key: edlin, have any URLs for the iPad IDE jer is working on?
06:52  Tomis: just plug it into the USB port in your mind
06:52  EdLin: key: it's in closed alpha, on jer's machine. :)
06:52  Tomis: then you can code without moving a muscle
06:53  key: EdLin: Is it just like, write up some source, and compile on the iPad? Or something new 
06:53  Ballresin: They gave those mind control machines out at vmworld... Crazy things.
06:53  EdLin: Tomis: someone made a neuro interface for the Nokia N900.
06:53  EdLin: key: he didn't give many details, sounds like that though, yes.
06:53  neuro: you're saying i'm an interface?
06:54  EdLin: neuro: in your face. You misread it. I said in your face. ;-)
06:54  Branes: The keyboard isn't an interface, it's an in-your-face :)
06:54  Ballresin: I just want a text editor with syntax highlighting and GIT integration.
06:54  Branes: Get *out* o' mah head, Ed! :D
06:54  neuro: a nokia n900 was in my face? man, that phone's got some stones
06:54  EdLin: Branes: we're on the same wavelength.

07:49  salamandyr: anyone who has one - how are the stereo speakers in the 27" imacs?
07:53  Tomis: i'm pleased with the speakers on my 15" MBP, i'd expect the imac speakers would be even better
07:53  ChrisAM: I've got external speakers hooked up to the imac here... been a while since I used the internal ones.
07:54  ChrisAM: I've never been impressed with any apple built-in speakers.
07:54  salamandyr: ya, i like my mpb ones
07:54  salamandyr: but not sufficient for movie viewing, etc
07:55  Tomis: yea you're not going to get bass out of tiny speakers
07:56  Tomis: too bad you can't run the internal/external at once
07:56  Tomis: just plug in a subwoofer when you want good bass
07:57  ChrisAM: probably a hack for that somewhere... it's not a physical cutover when you plug something in.
07:58  Tomis: yea there's a noticable delay actually
07:58  salamandyr: ya, that'd be great, actually, to just add a woofer tube :)
07:59  Kasm279: ChrisAM: what about the TL iMac G3s?
07:59  Kasm279: err
07:59  Kasm279: SL, not TL
08:00  ChrisAM: What about them?
08:00  Kasm279: the harman kardon ones
08:00  Kasm279: also Tomis
08:00  Kasm279: USB subwoofer
08:01  Tomis: still can't drive both at once can you Kasm279 
08:01  Kasm279: yeah you can
08:02  Kasm279: the iSub did
08:25  Tomis: bah, where's my 1/8th female-female adapter
08:26  Tomis: i want google for real life
08:26  Kasm279: lmao
08:26  Tomis: or even better, a stereo system with bluetooth input
08:27  Kasm279: you can get little adaptors for that Tomis
08:28  Kasm279: they work well
08:28  Tomis: hmm, this is absurd but it will suffice
08:28  Tomis: a female 1/8th to male RCA connected to a female RCA to female 1/8th
08:29  Kasm279: lmao
08:29  Tomis: this is why i try to keep all my audio connector addapters connected to each other when not in use, so i don't lose them

08:33  Tomis: mmm teleport is awesome
08:34  Tomis: my macbook pro is now the most expensive wireless keyboard evar!!!
08:35  torchie_pre: yeah
08:35  torchie_pre: I had it for a while now
08:35  salamandyr: tomis - is there an easy way to get machines on a home or private network to tell teleport what their ip's are?
08:36  Tomis: it uses bonjour
08:36  londonmet050: any one got macbook air
08:36  londonmet050: is it painful slow
08:36  londonmet050: or ok
08:36  Tomis: i'd expect it runs about as well as a base model macbook
08:36  salamandyr: depends what you are doing with it
08:37  salamandyr: no need for photoshop, final cut, etc., and you'll be fine.
08:37  londonmet050: I wanna code a bit python
08:37  salamandyr: still fine
08:37  londonmet050: read some books
08:37  londonmet050: run some times vm
08:37  londonmet050: like bt4 or win xp
08:37  salamandyr: the ram is probably a bigger limit on those than the cpu
08:37  Tomis: it's the worst value in the lineup IMO
08:37  torchie_pre: what ever the case
08:37  salamandyr: ah.  that will be a problem
08:37  torchie_pre: get 8GB ram
08:38  salamandyr: you cannot, in a macbook air
08:38  Tomis: the price/performance is the worst in the whole mac line
08:38  londonmet050: I am getting seconds
08:38  salamandyr: ya, better to get a macbook
08:38  londonmet050: ok
08:38  torchie_pre: tomis what would you say is the best
08:38  londonmet050: how light is air
08:38  Tomis: desktops are always the best for price/performance
08:38  torchie_pre: I have a major chubby for the 13" pro
08:38  londonmet050: compared to macbook
08:38  torchie_pre: it's like
08:38  salamandyr: air's only have 2gb ram - never giong to run virtual machines really well
08:38  Tomis: the 15" is the base of the pro laptop lineup IMO
08:39  torchie_pre: one pound lighter
08:39  Tomis: the 13" is a joke
08:39  torchie_pre: whaaaat
08:39  salamandyr: the 13" does support 8gb ram at least
08:39  Tomis: it's a macbook in a spiffy case, nothing more
08:39  torchie_pre: I've had a hard time finding a comparable 13"
08:40  Tomis: crap speakers, crap GPU, etc etc
08:40  torchie_pre: non ULV processor + discrete-only graphics + optical drive + that weight
08:40  salamandyr: if you are performance oriented, it's not worth getting anything less than an i5 nowadays
08:40  salamandyr: but if you just need word processing, websurfing, and occasional VM, then a macbook with 4 gb will be ok
08:40  Tomis: heck, the 13" is *still* shipping with an outdated Core 2 CPU
08:41  salamandyr: right
08:41  torchie_pre: better than a ULV i3
08:41  salamandyr: you can get i5 ones pretty cheap
08:41  salamandyr: and since the macbook pros are prob getting an update in about a month, the current ones will drop in price by $50-$100 then, to clear invenotry
08:42  torchie_pre: do the 15s have good speakers, gpu?
08:42  Tomis: the 13" sorely needs an update
08:42  Tomis: yes torchie_pre 
08:42  salamandyr: i've got an older mpb
08:42  Tomis: comparative to the 13" at least
08:42  torchie_pre: I feel like the envy 14 would own the mbp 15
08:42  salamandyr: 2.8 c2d, 7200 rpm, 6gb, xpress slot - and it's perfect except for the ram limit
08:42  londonmet050: salamandyr: they get update in a month?
08:43  salamandyr: ya, probably
08:43  londonmet050: I bought like month ago
08:43  londonmet050: damn
08:43  remyo: Weren't you getting an envy torchie_pre 
08:43  torchie_pre: nope I was just doing a comparison
08:43  salamandyr: will be a bump in the cpu speed only, probably
08:43  Tomis: google "mac buyers guide" before any mac pruchase londonmet050 
08:43  torchie_pre: for my next machine
08:43  torchie_pre: I may get another mac
08:43  torchie_pre: or a thinkpad
08:44  torchie_pre: but the problem is a thinkpad isn't a mac
08:44  Tomis: apple's gonna sell off their mac division
08:44  Tomis: they're going all iToys
08:44  torchie_pre: yeah
08:44  Tomis: better get the thinkpad instead
08:44  salamandyr: i'm getting an i7 imac next. wanna figure out how to use ipad/mbp to vnc back to it at home. 
08:44  torchie_pre: ipad will wreck all the shit
08:45  londonmet050: Well i5 is not that bad
08:45  salamandyr: not at all
08:45  torchie_pre: well if there's ever xcode for ipad, to what extent would I need to stick with dumpy old macintosh
08:45  londonmet050: but the price compared to other i5's is horrid
08:45  salamandyr: which machine?
08:45  londonmet050: MBP 15
08:45  torchie_pre: with its buttons and its windowing system
08:45  salamandyr: iz nice
08:45  Tomis: be a few years until ipad is self-managing yet
08:46  londonmet050: They should make i7 as standard
08:46  Tomis: but then how would they upsell you londonmet050 
08:46  salamandyr: happens in a month, i bet ;)
08:46  londonmet050: I will sell mine next week
08:46  salamandyr: 2.8 burstable to 3.2 (single) or something, i7s in the top model standard
08:46  londonmet050: before lossing any money
08:46  londonmet050: and wait
08:46  Tomis: heh
08:47  londonmet050: then again I got a good deal 
08:47  Tomis: well i got mine new for 1599
08:47  londonmet050: in UK base mbp 15 is costing 1499£
08:47  londonmet050: I got for 1100£
08:47  torchie_pre: so expensive
08:47  londonmet050: yah
08:47  Tomis: 1100?! that's like 2 million USD!
08:48  londonmet050: I might sell after like few months for least 900-1000
08:48  Tomis: or 5milion canadian!
08:48  torchie_pre: how bad is the gpu in the 13" compared to 15" really
08:48  salamandyr: unless you game like mad, you'll never notice
08:48  Tomis: it's integrated instead of discrete
08:48  londonmet050: yah
08:48  torchie_pre: what
08:48  salamandyr: or watch a lot of really huge HD video files
08:48  Tomis: so it's eating system memory
08:48  torchie_pre: I thought 13" was discrete
08:48  salamandyr: does mean you should max the system memory
08:48  londonmet050: well even 9400m plays hd without a hitch
08:49  salamandyr: yup
08:49  torchie_pre: geforce 320M
08:49  salamandyr: i'm running on my integrated one on the 15" mbp 99% of the time, and often drive a 21.5 external w/o problems
08:49  Tomis: yup, it's integrated torchie_pre 
08:49  Tomis: 330 is he discrete one
08:50  torchie_pre: huh.
08:50  londonmet050: yah me too
08:50  torchie_pre: didn't know there were nvidia integrateds
08:50  londonmet050: most of the time I run integrated
08:51  Tomis: how can you even tell londonmet050 
08:51  torchie_pre: "the 330M can run as much as twice as fast as the 320M"
08:51  londonmet050: ?
08:51  londonmet050: I got an app
08:51  londonmet050: which can show 
08:51  londonmet050: gfx card status
08:58  londonmet050: why the room gone so cold like that
08:58  Tomis: because we forgot to pay the heating bill
08:59  Tomis: what's this app called?
09:01  londonmet050: lol
09:01  londonmet050: londonmet050: gfx card status
09:03  Tomis: ah, nifty
09:05  Tomis: oooo and it can let you manualyl select which one ot use
09:05  Tomis: niiice
09:08  londonmet050: is it a good idea to buy g4 powerbook
09:08  londonmet050: can it run flash and hd?
09:13  Tomis: no londonmet050 
09:14  Tomis: PPC machines are rather anemic at modern tasks, and rapidly becoming incompatible as more software drops PPC
09:15  richardcavell: yeah
09:15  richardcavell: strange that they didn't continue the architecture
09:15  richardcavell: what's the real reason for that?
09:15  richardcavell: I mean, with Apple computers using them they should have had enough demand
09:15  richardcavell: Apple were always complaining about low supply
09:15  londonmet050: well
09:15  torchie_pre: not enough jiggawatts
09:15  londonmet050: I was thinking to get some second laptop
09:16  londonmet050: just to browse and code 
09:16  londonmet050: and run may be one vm
09:16  salamandyr: the "cpu speed myth" ceased to be a myth with all the market pressure behind intel architecture..  less pressure on ppc, slower advancement.
09:16  londonmet050: or will g4 just stuck
09:16  richardcavell: well PPC should have served it up to Intel
09:16  richardcavell: No reason why PPC couldn't go as fast
09:16  londonmet050: I did like PPC
09:16  londonmet050: shame they dropped it
09:17  salamandyr: we might see a return of apple designed / produced chips pretty soon
09:17  salamandyr: beyond the A4 in use in the phone/pad
09:17  torchie_pre: I'm thinking
09:18  torchie_pre: ipad replaces macintosh
09:18  torchie_pre: A7 kicks major ass
09:18  torchie_pre: mice and keyboards die
09:19  londonmet050: g4 is really horrid comparing to core duo
09:19  londonmet050: or core2 duo
09:19  Tomis: this macbook pro is at like 90% idle most of the time
09:20  Tomis: it's got 4 cores available, and it pulls around 8 hours on a charge
09:20 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
09:20  torchie_pre: 8 hours doing what?
09:20  salamandyr: i'm sure i could keep it cranking
09:20  salamandyr: :)
09:20  londonmet050: what 4 cores
09:21  salamandyr: just give it 100gb of EEG data to do math on.. haven't found a machine yet i cannot use 95% of :)
09:21  Tomis: 2 physical, 4 virtual londonmet050 
09:21  richardcavell: You mean electroencephalography?
09:22  salamandyr: ya
09:23  londonmet050: which one
09:23  londonmet050: i7?
09:25  Tomis: MBP 15" i5
09:25  londonmet050: ?
09:25  londonmet050: I thought it wont have 4 virtual cores
09:25  londonmet050: so what is the difference between core i5 and i7
09:25  Tomis: 2 more i's?
09:26  rootusr: clock speed, l2 cache
09:26  londonmet050: thats it?
09:26  rootusr: pretty much
09:26  londonmet050: i got one before with i7
09:26  Tomis: L2 cache is 256k per core on my machine
09:26  londonmet050: it was fun
09:26  londonmet050: not bad
09:27  torchie_pre: waiting for the Apple A7

09:40  rootusr: londonmet050: w510 won't play well with osx
09:40  londonmet050: yah sure
09:40  londonmet050: that is the reason i m stuck with mbp
09:41  rootusr: and the battery life, weight, size...
09:41  londonmet050: I got hold back
09:41  londonmet050: as the plastic put me off
09:42  londonmet050: I am used to this unibody
09:42  londonmet050: and everything else looks bit fragile
09:42  Tomis: can't wait for apple to have a dual-drive option
09:42  rootusr: i think thinkpads are pretty durable machines
09:43  rootusr: compare to others
09:43  londonmet050: yah
09:43  londonmet050: but they remved roll cage
09:43  londonmet050: and the gpu is not that cool
09:43  Tomis: imagine dual SSD RAID'd for double performance
09:44  rootusr: yeah, mbp should totally get rid of the optical drive and add second hd
09:44  rootusr: at least as an option
09:44  Tomis: or if they used the optical drive space for an extra battery, mwaa ha ha
09:44  Tomis: now that would be a wicked BTO
09:44  salamandyr: there are kits for this 
09:45  Tomis: yea, there are, but they void the warranty AFAIK
09:45  salamandyr: thinking about doing it to my mpb.  the optical drive doesn't work that well anyway
09:45  rootusr: salamandyr: remove optical drive on new mbps void ur warranty 
09:45  londonmet050: yah it sucks
09:46  salamandyr: ya, mine is 2 years old
09:46  rootusr: i may get the kit and use it later when i got the spare $$
09:47  rootusr: have to wait and see if this machine is problem free
09:47  torchie_pre: that'd be a heck of a thing to do in the macbook air refresh
09:47  torchie_pre: like just don't make it ridiculously thinner-and-lighter
09:48  torchie_pre: remove optical
09:48  rootusr: mba wont have the space to fit in 2 ssd
09:48  salamandyr: ya.. doubt that a 2nd drive'd fit in a mba
09:48  torchie_pre: replace with cool stuff
09:48  salamandyr: no optical to start with
09:48  torchie_pre: well I mean
09:48  rootusr: especially if they gonna do the 11'6 inch
09:48  torchie_pre: I was thinking
09:48  torchie_pre: make the air a mbp 15"
09:48  torchie_pre: but without optical
09:49  torchie_pre: or something.
09:49  torchie_pre: then again
09:49  rootusr: probably a mba pro...
09:49  torchie_pre: if they put a battery in that space it'd be heavier
09:49  salamandyr: 15" air doesn't make sense for thin/superlight, handle-able
09:49  torchie_pre: 13" sans optical?
09:49  Tomis: but think of how much extra battert life it could get
09:50  Tomis: 20 hours on a charge!
09:50  Tomis: ok, maybe more like 15
09:50  Tomis: but still
09:50  salamandyr: if SSD only, then sure
09:50  torchie_pre: god I want a 24 hour laptop
09:50  torchie_pre: would be so hot
09:50  salamandyr: the ipad runs for days
09:50  rootusr: ipad could kill mba if apple dont be careful
09:50  Tomis: how would that be a problem rootusr 
09:51  torchie_pre: 10 hours is not a day
09:51  Tomis: they're making money either way
09:51  salamandyr: the ipad does run for days - not 10 hours
09:51  torchie_pre: yeah the mba is kind of a problem child anyway
09:51  rootusr: Tomis: i dont care, lol but it seems that steve loves mba
09:51  Tomis: the MBA is the laptop version of the Mac Cube imo
09:52  torchie_pre: ?
09:52  rootusr: it's a piece of art in design, but useless
09:52  Tomis: a great idea, with a crap price tag
09:52  Tomis: yup
09:52  Tomis: they need to reboot the air with a mac mini price tag
09:52  Tomis: $799 MBA, $999 MB, $1199 MBP
09:53  rootusr: i say boost up ipad to $1000 and make it more useful with osx and real cpus
09:53  Tomis: lol
09:53  Tomis: no
09:53  Branes: Won't happen
09:53  rootusr: if they decide to kill mba
09:53  Tomis: a touch screen device needs an iOS UI
09:54  torchie_pre: A4 is the real cpu
09:54  rootusr: no it's not
09:54  Branes: The life of Intel in Macs: 18-24 months.
09:54  salamandyr: maybe move the 2.8 c2d to the mba, the mb all i3, and the mbp i5 and i7
09:54  rootusr: back to risc?
09:54  Branes: ARM
09:54  torchie_pre: part of the reason the ipad succeeds at all is becase it's running ARM
09:55  rootusr: Branes: apple need to give up lots of market share if they decide to go that way
09:55  torchie_pre: most of the reason, even
09:55  Branes: I had my allegations of Apple switching to ARM confirmed by an ex senior Apple engineer earlier today.
09:55  rootusr: especially after sl just ditched ppc
09:56  torchie_pre: ARM apple computers with 24 hour battery would be sweet
09:56  Branes: Multicore ARMs at that. And iOS Desktop to replace Mac OS X.
09:56  Tomis: lol
09:56  rootusr: i can see mba or mb to go with a4, but that's pretty much it
09:56  rootusr: for now
09:57  Tomis: iOS desktop to replace OS X
09:57  Tomis: yea..
09:57  Branes: rootusr: One of the worms I have in 1IL has been working with a multicore ARM prototype for the last three weeks.
09:57  rootusr: ya, and ios wont be able to fit with a real os needs
09:57  Tomis: iOS will keep growing
09:57  Tomis: no need for a spin-off
09:58  Branes: Not iOS as it currently stands. iOS will have all of the toys & tweaks OSX currently has available.
09:58  Tomis: we're only 3 years in to iOS
09:58  Tomis: where was the mac os  3 years in?
09:58  rootusr: Branes: the thing is, is apple willing to give up osx?
09:59  Tomis: of course not rootusr 
09:59  Tomis: it's a transition to a new platform
09:59  Branes: Springboard will replace Finder, which will be relegated to /Utilities. No terminal or BSD userspace installed by default; you'll get them back if you install iCode.
10:00  Branes: rootusr: iOS shares the same heart as OSX. It'll be OSX in a new (psychedelic dayglo) lounge suit :)
10:00  rootusr: ok then the next mac i'll ever get would be an xserver or mac pro
10:00  Tomis: lol
10:00  Branes: Thay'll have ARMs in them too :)
10:00  Tomis: i doubt that
10:00  rootusr: right
10:00  Branes: I know so.
10:00  rootusr: not in next 12-24 month
10:00  Tomis: you can't just slap 50 cores in there and get the same performance
10:01  rootusr: 5 years, maybe
10:01  Branes: Apple's own multicore ARM based chips, across the board.
10:01  Tomis: not everything benifits from multi-threading
10:01  rootusr: apple should buy arm and adobe then they are problem free to switch back to risc
10:01  Branes: rootusr: Apple already *own* ARM.
10:02  Branes: Well, 65% controlling stock, anyway.
10:02  Tomis: why would they switch back to a crappy custom CPU?
10:02  rootusr: Branes: they dont, they still pay the license
10:02  rootusr: right
10:02  torchie_pre: didn't that crappy custom cpu just wreck everyone's junk in sales
10:02  Branes: No they don't. Apple were one of the founding companies that set up ARM Holdings in 1990.
10:02  rootusr: ok im reading the wiki
10:02  Branes: 40% founding stake, increased to 55% in April, 65% in May.
10:03  rootusr: lol
10:03  Savior: LOL mac
10:04  ivo_: It is just a prototype
10:04  Branes: G'day, hows things in Texas?
10:04  ivo_: perhaps it wont workout
10:05  Branes: It already has, ivo - the A4 is a brilliant piece of silicon engineering.
10:05  rootusr: yeah, i doubt apple could actually "own" arm
10:05  ivo_: and sandy bridge will be great
10:05  torchie_pre: man I want an ipad
10:05  rootusr: i dont, not this gen
10:05  Savior: mac > win > linux
10:05  ivo_: why do you want it?
10:05  rootusr: lol
10:05  Branes: You forget who's in charge over there, rootusr - the world's biggest control freak. What Steve wants, Steve gets.
10:06  Tomis: he's also a businessman Branes 
10:06  Branes: A smart one. 
10:06  rootusr: Savior: in which world ur talkin' about?
10:06  Savior: whoops wrong way: mac < windows < linux
10:06  Tomis: i don't see what business sense switching the mac to ARM would make
10:06  torchie_pre: ivo_: it revolutionizes it
10:06  rootusr: Savior: that's about right
10:06  Tomis: would it save them money? would it provide extremely big performance increases?
10:06  Savior: rootusr: yes :D
10:07  ivo_: torchie_pre ??
10:07  ivo_: what do you mean
10:07  rootusr: Branes: sjobs wants to get what he wants
10:07  Branes: I do, Tomis. Differentiation, flexibility (the ARM can still run Windows apps), HUGE increase in battery life and lower power consumption.
10:07  torchie_pre: depending on your definition of performance
10:07  torchie_pre: ivo_: it changes it
10:07  EdLin: ARM can't run Windows apps.
10:07  Tomis: one of the big selling points of the mac currently are the fact that it has an intel chip
10:07  rootusr: of course risc is better than cisc
10:07  Branes: Tomis: Remember, the only thing that matters to Apple is the OS.
10:07  rootusr: that's proven in theory 
10:08  Branes: The whole Intel thing is shaping up to be the world's biggest bait-and-switch campaign ever :)
10:08  rootusr: no only thing matters to apple is their hardware
10:08  Branes: Nuh-uh.
10:08  Tomis: so switching to an uncommon chip once again, there would have to be huge gains for them to do that
10:08  Branes: Stop thinking like a geek.
10:08  Savior: no u
10:08  rootusr: apple is a hardware company, not software
10:08  Savior: Branes: how should we think?
10:08  Branes: Yes; it means they are beholden to no-one but themselves.
10:08  Tomis: and?
10:09  Branes: Apple don't sell hardware. They sell solutions.
10:09  EdLin: rootusr: Apple is a solutions company.
10:09  rootusr: that's why they give away their os free but not sell it to other hw manufactures 
10:09  Tomis: it's not like intel has them in a corner like IBM did
10:09  EdLin: Branes: stop stealing my words.
10:09  Branes: ED! OUTA MA HEAD, BIATCH! :)
10:09  richardcavell: Branes: Let me throw an additional element into this: Jobs is a cancer survivor with a liver transplant and doesn't have long to live
10:09  torchie_pre: lol
10:09  Savior: so who in this channel be mad if i pirated osx?
10:09  Savior: +9
10:09  torchie_pre: man
10:09  Tomis: they went with ARM for the iOS devices because it beat intel's offerings in the low-power space
10:09  torchie_pre: what are we gonna do when my homedawg jobs is gone
10:09  rootusr: Savior: i pirated it too, dont worry
10:09  Tomis: sell your stock immediately torchie_pre 
10:09  Tomis: that's what
10:10  Branes: Everyone, savior. I suggest you ask mommy to change your nappy, but this time put it on the right end because you're dribbling shit again.
10:10  Savior: rootusr, you cool guy
10:10  rootusr: lol
10:10  richardcavell: Why would you pirate OS X?  It only cost like 30 bucks
10:10  rootusr: calm down guys...
10:10  Savior: Branes: so buying something from Apple is the right thing to do?
10:11  Savior: even though jobs couldnt give less of a f*ck about you?
10:11  Branes: Savior: If you want OSX, yes. 
10:11  Savior: makes total sense yo
10:11  Tomis: because he's trying desperately to troll richardcavell 
10:11  rootusr: i just dont understand since when apple stop selling hw but solutions...
10:11  Tomis: they don't sell PCs rootusr 
10:11  Savior: Tomis: why do people call others trolls when they dont have the same opinion as them?
10:11  Branes: rootusr: They've never sold hardware, even back in the Apple II days.
10:11  Tomis: they sell the whole widget
10:11  rootusr: Tomis: they still sell tones of hardwares
10:11  rootusr: dont they?
10:12  Tomis: mac's run os x, the OS and the hardware are tweaked for each other
10:12  torchie_pre: you see
10:12  Savior: Tomis: and super duper expensive
10:12  Tomis: iToys need iTunes, etc.
10:12  torchie_pre: the hardware and software
10:12  torchie_pre: together
10:12  torchie_pre: make a machine
10:12  rootusr: but they still make money with their hardwares, not software
10:12  Branes: Apple do everything backwards to every other IT company on the planet, that's how they managed to catch the competition out, grab so many people by the short-n-curlies, and become the second largest company in the world.
10:12  Tomis: it's a complete top-to-bottom widget
10:12  ivo_: the only think appl users need
10:12  Tomis: they're not selling comodity peices
10:12  ivo_: is itunes
10:12  ivo_: :D
10:12  Tomis: they selling it all in one package
10:12  Savior: Branes: SECOND largest :)
10:13  Branes: Apple sell solutions, and every solution is MacOS in one form or another ... but for the price, the include the electronics to run the solution.
10:13  crunchy135711: 2nd after who?
10:13  Branes: Yes, Savior, behind Exxon-Mobil.
