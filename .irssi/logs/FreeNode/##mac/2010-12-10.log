00:12 * LordDragon runs away from alexlea 
00:12  alexlea: LordDragon: i want to be homeless again!
00:12  LordDragon: DONT HIT ME!
00:12  alexlea: lol
00:12  alexlea: LordDragon: you should start your own mac store, but you would prolly never sell anything
00:12  LordDragon: haha
00:12  alexlea: you would hoard all hte stock
00:12  LordDragon: your prolly right alexlea :p
00:12  alexlea: the*

00:14  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  haha - http://www.shopbot.com.au/pp-intel-xeon-x5365-price-81952.html
00:14  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  perhaps not such a sane upgrade ;)
00:14  LordDragon: Velociraptors, omg. and thats for just ONE
00:15  LordDragon: macpros dont seem overpriced when you take in to account the cost of those server cpus, eh Velociraptors ?
00:16  Velociraptors: :)
00:17  LordDragon: what this one Velociraptors ? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116308&cm_re=xeon_lga_771-_-19-116-308-_-Product
00:17  LordDragon: er what about
00:18  Dink: Why wouldn't I be able to ping another mac on my network ? Firewall is turned of.
00:18  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  not sure - I can't remember just which CPUs were usable on ours. 
00:18  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i thought any lga 771 should work no? 
00:25  barathron: Anyone else think Safari 5.0.3 sucks worse than any previous version? 
00:25  alexlea: whendid that come out?
00:25  alexlea: i am always behind....argh
00:26  LordDragon: whatever the current version of safari is, there is an annoying bug with video playback. sometimes i have to quit and reload the browswer because the video starts getting choppy
00:26  alexlea: i am never able to watch video
00:26  alexlea: well, w/o something going wrong i mean
00:26  alexlea: i usually dl vids
00:26  LordDragon: alexlea, why not?
00:27  LordDragon: alexlea, you cant stream youtube vids ?
00:27  alexlea: youtube ALWAYS freezes on me, i used to think it was only a connection deal, but it does it even after its 100% done (red line all teh way across)
00:27  alexlea: LordDragon: i can, but it sux
00:27  LordDragon: alexlea, wow. hmm. what about in html5 mode? maybe its a flash problem
00:28  alexlea: LordDragon: this is my first hearing og html5 mode
00:28  alexlea: is that in safari settings?
00:28  LordDragon: alexlea, there is a way you can set youtube to give you the html5 version of playing videos that doesnt use flash
00:28  alexlea: or is that a youtube setting
00:29  LordDragon: alexlea, http://www.youtube.com/html5
00:29  LordDragon: alexlea, i saw this there
00:29  LordDragon: Additional Restrictions (we are working on these!)
00:29  LordDragon: Videos with ads are not supported (they will play in the Flash player)
00:30  alexlea: ok
00:30  LordDragon: which as far as i know is 95% of all youtube videos. so i dont know how much html5 mode will help you. but u can try it
00:30  LordDragon: alexlea, another option is click2flash. heard of that?
00:30  alexlea: no, i wil google it
00:31  alexlea: usually i use keepvid, and dl the vids
00:31  alexlea: i used to just curl -o the vids, but they split them up into a million pieces now
00:32  LordDragon: alexlea, the link is here: http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/
00:32  LordDragon: clicktoflash basically uses quicktime plugin to play the youtube video instead of flash
00:32  LordDragon: so it uses alot less cpu and u can avoid the ads
00:33  alexlea: i am gonan install that and try it out then
00:33  alexlea: http://clicktoflash.com/ <--gonna use thatone instead...
00:33  alexlea: dont feel like dealing with git today
00:34  LordDragon: alexlea, oh i didnt even notice. i thought they had binaries there
00:34  alexlea: they might...but i found my link before yours...actually yours hasnt loaded yet
00:35  alexlea: i miss LA
00:36  LordDragon: alexlea, were you serious earlier about wishing you were homeless again?
00:36  alexlea: LordDragon: yes/no  no, because homeless is the wrong word, cause when i was traveling and living in a vehicle, i might have been techincally homeless, but i reallywasnt
00:37  alexlea: LordDragon: do i want to go back to that lifestyle? yes
00:37  alexlea: i am bored as hell now...and i see the same stuff everyday, its like being in a cage
00:37  LordDragon: alexlea, wow. i thought the other day u were just telling me how you wish u could have a place to stay put
00:37  alexlea: just sitting here waiting to die basically
00:38  LordDragon: alexlea, i think your previous lifestyle has become engrained in to you, so that not always being on the open road feels wrong to you
00:38  alexlea: yeah
00:38  alexlea: i NEED to be a truck driver...then i would get paid have stability AND get to travel
00:39  LordDragon: alexlea, we all die sooner or later. being on the road doesnt change that right?
00:40  alexlea: being on the road gives me something to do...it lets me live
00:40  alexlea: i am just existing right now...and doing nothing
00:41  alexlea: i'm not unhappy or anything...each ways have pros and cons...i think a big part of it is i dont like Phoenix
00:41  alexlea: LA is my home
00:41  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah but. your on the road. driving. what is that accomplishing more than hanging out at an apartment?
00:42  alexlea: LordDragon: objectively, nothing. But, I enjoy travelling, so for me personally it accomplishes my happiness
00:47  alexlea: click2flash is giving me worse results, instead of choppy video no video
00:48 --- Dink_ is now known as Dink
00:51  LordDragon: alexlea, hmm really? maybe cuz your in html5 mode?
01:00  alexlea: maybe, i dunno
01:11  Ambeer: Hi guys, whats the best alternative to Wine?
01:11  Ambeer: i need to run an .exe
01:12  MultiFinder: A VM.
01:13  Kasm279: Ambeer: with Wine i assume you mean Darwine?
01:13  LordDragon: Ambeer, crossover does a better job than wine. though for the best compatibilty, a VM works
01:13  Ambeer: hrm
01:14  Ambeer: For crossover do i need to set it up using the terminal?
01:14  LordDragon: Ambeer, nope. its basically wine, but made easy to use. its all graphical. though its not free
01:14  Ambeer: ugh
01:14  Ambeer: I need a free one
01:15  LordDragon: Ambeer, there really isnt a free way to do it. you could download virtualbox and make a vm, but then youd still need a copy of windows to install on it
01:15  Ambeer: I'll just use Wine then
01:18  mrapple: Ambeer: i have an extra license of crossover lying around
01:19  mrapple: i got a bunch when they had the "free crossover" promotion
01:19  Ambeer: You would give it to a stranger?
01:19  mrapple: i dont need 10 of them ;)
01:20  Ambeer: Thank you!
01:20  Ambeer: You can PM me it
01:21  LordDragon: <mrapple> Ambeer: i have an extra license of crossover lying around  <--- AKA he has a keygen :P
01:21  mrapple: LordDragon: i have an email from them, about 10 of them
01:21  LordDragon: mrapple, ithought it was one per customer
01:22  mrapple: well, oops ;)
01:22  LordDragon: thats pretty dishonest. no more honorable ppl on the internet i guess :(
01:22  mrapple: nope
01:26  Swian: I tried crossover office, for the money it should work better
01:31  diffract|: so did it work better?
02:03  LordDragon: Swian, agreed. i got crossover games and every single game ive thrown at it has failed to work properly
02:04  Ambeer: Bootcamp works the best
02:04  Ambeer: :)
02:04  LordDragon: yes it does, but it requires me to reboot each time
02:04  Ambeer: oh no!
02:05  LordDragon: surf the web and check email, boot into osx, want to play a game, boot into windows, want to listen to my itunes library, boot back into osx, etc etc
02:05  LordDragon: its a pain in the ass
02:06  Ambeer: if you want to listen to your music library
02:06  Ambeer: can tyou browse to the folder that holds the mp3 and run it in windows?
02:07  LordDragon: Ambeer, hmm i cant tell if your trolling or not. but i didnt buy a macpro so that i can find ways to run everything in windows
02:07  Ambeer: Im not trolling....
02:07  LordDragon: sure
02:07  LordDragon: i could install software
02:07  LordDragon: an email client
02:07  LordDragon: itunes
02:07  LordDragon: video player
02:07  LordDragon: all in windows
02:07  Ambeer: In OSX, all your music files are stored in a folder
02:07  Ambeer: correct?
02:08  LordDragon: and then... id be.. doing everything in windows. whats the point of a mac then?
02:08  Ambeer: or did you buy music from itunes?
02:08  Ambeer: if so, then lol
02:10  LordDragon: Ambeer, ah i see. so your advice is to use windows for everything and to pirate music. thanks for your input (/ignore) 
02:11  alexlea: LordDragon: um, you have like a million computers...why not make one a game puter? :P
02:11  Ambeer: I never said that...
02:11  LordDragon: ADT alexlea 
02:11  alexlea: adt, yay
02:11  LordDragon: alexlea, you have an excellent point. and there is a reason. 1 monitor :(
02:12  alexlea: LordDragon: ??? um, well, the macbook pro had its own monitor
02:12  Ambeer: and multiple moniters plug into multiple computers
02:12 +Branes: http://regmedia.co.uk/2010/11/25/ventblockers_smoker_01.jpg <- What happens when you smoke next to a MacBook
02:12  alexlea: has*
02:12  alexlea: Branes: LIES
02:12  alexlea: :D
02:13  alexlea: Branes: i chain smoke, and the inside of my mac does not look like that...
02:13  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah but i dont think id be comfy playing a FPS or MMORPG on a 15in macbook screen. but it is possible im sure. though id be a bit nervous about driving the gpu too hard on a lappy
02:13  alexlea: LordDragon: then make the pro the gaming puter, and the macbook pro your surfing puter?
02:13  alexlea: i dunno
02:14  alexlea: LordDragon: or buy another monitor...lmfao
02:14  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah there are ways i suppose. i wish this desk didnt have one of those erm.. shelves thingies. otherwise i could do a dual monitor setup. but the way my desk is built, theres only room for one
02:14  alexlea: LordDragon: buy a new desk
02:15  LordDragon: alexlea, lol stop giving me a hard time! :D
02:15  alexlea: LordDragon: i'm not...i have embraced your habbit, and am giving advice accordingly
02:15  alexlea: LordDragon: a new desk is less than 100
02:15  LordDragon: alexlea, haha. thanks. 
02:15  alexlea: LordDragon: in the scheme of things, it makes sense...a desk is very important imo, so it shoudl work the way you wnat it
02:16  alexlea: LordDragon: *if* i were you, i would want a HUGE desk taht accomodated all my toys; my last desk was 8 feet wide, and 3 feet deep
02:16  LordDragon: alexlea, well, as you saw from my pic, all those shelves are full of things. so id need to come up with a plan where to fit all my other gear. but it is possible im sure
02:16  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah. this desk is super old too. im prob due for a new one
02:17  LordDragon: when i first bought this desk, i spent a night putting it together with my ex gf
02:17  LordDragon: this desk is a beast. it has a million pieces
02:18  alexlea: LordDragon: i personally am a big fan of  milkcrates and a $20 piece of plywood
02:18  alexlea: 6 milkcreates*
02:18  alexlea: actually, um, i like those cafeteria tables
02:18  LordDragon: alexlea, lol. i suppose that technically would work
02:18  alexlea: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31to99O09DL.jpg
02:19  alexlea: thats what i had, except bigger
02:19  alexlea: i am guessing on dimensions, i think it was prolly 6 feet wide, not 8
02:19  alexlea: and like 2 and half 2o 3 feet deep
02:19  alexlea: 3 people would have fit side by side, at least
02:20  alexlea: 4 actually
02:20  alexlea: i like lots of space
02:21  LordDragon: alexlea, ive thought of just removing the shelves part of this desk. but the way the desk was designed, it needs those pieces for stability
02:21  alexlea: theres always a way to compensate
02:21  alexlea: like if you like the desk other than the shelves
02:22  alexlea: i dont like "desks", i like tables, because i ahte shelves and drawers
02:22  alexlea: i hate closets too
02:22  alexlea: i like to see everything
02:23 * alexlea was Japanese in a former life
02:23  LordDragon: alexlea, hehe. simple is nice too. ive seen some very simple looking desks that were nice and big but had style too
02:24  alexlea: i dont like style
02:24  alexlea: :)
02:24  LordDragon: alexlea, sure you do. you like to personalize/stylize your mac desktop
02:25  alexlea: lies
02:25  LordDragon: alexlea, i have seen proof with these 2 eyes! :P
02:25  alexlea: wasnt me, your mistaken
02:25  alexlea: lol
02:25  LordDragon: haha
02:25  LordDragon: perhaps, perhaps ;)
02:25  LordDragon: but i dnot think so
02:26  alexlea: what i mean is when it comes to furniture, i like as simple as possible, i like rectangles, and squares...dont like embellished stylish things
02:26  alexlea: i dont like furniture really though
02:26  alexlea: i like sleeping on the floor

14:58  Dink: Hello, is there a way to route traffic through my normal gateway and not through a juniper vpn? Right now all my traffic is going through the juniper vpn. 
14:58 +Tomis: turn the VPN off Dink ?
14:58  Dink: Without turning it off. I remember there use to be a way to have both. 
14:59 +Tomis: there are settings in system prefs to route all traffic through the VPN
14:59 +Tomis: turn that off and make the VPN lower in the service order, then it won't get automatically chosen
14:59 +Branes_: web_knows: Bones is right, the multiple drives would have to live inside a single enclosure with its own onboard smarts to make them all appear as a single logical volume to the Mac.
15:00 +Tomis: DU says you can make a concated RAID Branes_ 
15:00  Dink: Tomis: the juniper vpn is .jnlp app that runs and tweaks your settings. 
15:00 +Tomis: so it doesn't show up as a network interface in system prefs?
15:00  Dink: It doesn't show up in the network preferences
15:00 +Tomis: well that's anoying
15:01  web_knows: Branes_, that's what I was thinking of: a single logical volume.
15:01 +Tomis: using concated disks for backup seams like a bad plan though
15:01  Dink: Tomis:  yeah it is. I do however see it in netstat -nr
15:01 +Tomis: one of those disks goes down, there goes your whole backup
15:01 +Branes_: Pretty much.
15:01 +Tomis: and if it's in software...
15:01 +Branes_: s-l-o-w
15:01 +Tomis: then good luck taking that raid to another machine
15:03  web_knows: ok
15:04  web_knows: I'm taking that back then : )
15:04 +Tomis: mirror raid would be bestfor backups, you get data redundancy
15:04  web_knows: it's just I bought another external drive with enclosure
15:04  web_knows: (it was a great deal)
15:04  web_knows: and I'm trying to find an use to it :)
15:05  web_knows: so now I got 2 external drives w/ enclosure
15:05  web_knows: each one of 500gb
15:05 +Tomis: same size? mirror raid
15:05  Dink: So is there a way to move my non vpn interface higher via cli  or edit the route table so it is higher than the vpn ?
15:07  web_knows: Tomis, well, that is the point though.. I feel like I'm throwing 500gb away with mirror raid :/
15:07  web_knows: maaybe it's just a mistaken idea
15:07  web_knows: until the day one of the drives die :)
15:07 +Tomis: well yea
15:08 +Tomis: how big is the drive you're backing up?
15:08  web_knows: it is a 320gb drive
15:08  web_knows: but i've made a partition of 250gb
15:08  web_knows: to use as macintosh hd
15:08 +Tomis: bootcamp?
15:08  web_knows: nope
15:09  web_knows: unallocated space laying around
15:09 +Tomis: why
15:09  web_knows: to work better with my time machine backups
15:09 +Tomis: that doesn't make sense
15:09  web_knows: my time machine hard drive is 500gb
15:09 +Tomis: you want your time machine drive to be 1.5 to 2x bigger than the drive you're backing up, yea
15:09  web_knows: well, apple's recommendation is to have a drive for time machine doubled the size of the drive you are backing up
15:09 +Tomis: but it's not a strict requirement
15:10 +Tomis: the more space on the backup drive, the more detailed backups you get
15:10  web_knows: right
15:10 +Tomis: ie, the more revisions of each file
15:10 +Branes_: web_knows: Two ideas. Use one as midlinbe storage for all your big, ungainly movies & the like, and only plug it in when you want to add something to it, or get something from it -- the rest of the time it lives on a shelf. Second idea is to do a full carboncopycloner (or DU image) of your internal to one of the externals, and again leave it on the shelf til you need it.
15:10 +Tomis: you're just wasting space by making a smaller partition
15:11 +Branes_: "Data that is not backed up -- at least twice, preferably with an offsite backup -- is data you do not want." :)
15:11  web_knows: Branes_, i like the second idea, i used to do that with a 2.5" drive, a clone bootable backup
15:12  web_knows: Tomis, well, yeah
15:12 +Branes_: Tis what I do. Just did my monthly clone, actually.
15:12  web_knows: Branes_, the 1st idea, I don't feel like it is too.. practical?
15:12  web_knows: pluging stuff in and out
15:13  Angostura: Branes. In your seminal quote above, could you comment on the 'at least twice' element
15:13 +Branes_: Mid-line storage, it's called. It's *very* practical.
15:13  web_knows: I like "plug-it-and-forget it" the most
15:13  Angostura: Apart from the house burning down, thieves taking the lot - what is wrong with a TM backup as sole backup strategy?
15:13 +Branes_: What're you going to do, have a hard drive spinning away, chewing power, just because you *might* want to watch something? ;)
15:14 +Branes_: TM backups can become corrupted.
15:14 +Tomis: huh? the drives sleep after an idle period
15:14 +Branes_: Not always, Tomis. Some drive enclosures don't do that.
15:14  web_knows: right
15:14 +Tomis: then buy a better one
15:14 +Tomis: lol
15:14 +Branes_: Others do it at really annoying times and you can't change their behaviour :)
15:15 +Tomis: then buy a better one again
15:15 +Branes_: Or just yank the drives out of the enclosures, donate the enclosures to some underprivileged (ie Windows) kid, and put the drives in a Drobo.
15:16 +Branes_: (or something of similar ilk)
15:17 +Branes_: web_knows: Another idea. If there's more than one internet/network user at your house, get an Addonics USB-to-NAS adaptor ($60-ish) and plug the other drive into your broadband router.
15:17 +Tomis: is that usable for time machine Branes?
15:18 +Branes_: If you do the defaults write hack, yes, but then the backup has a *really* high chance of getting corrupt.
15:18 +Tomis: meh
15:19  web_knows: Branes_, I have a page opened in my browser for a couple of days now
15:19 +Branes_: If you use something with similar features -- such as the paid-up version of SuperDuper! -- you can do almost the same thing as TM to any remote volume, without the fear of it getting corrupted and having the entire archive become un-usable.
15:19  web_knows: this page is a online store for a NAS solution
15:19  web_knows: just like your above idea :)
15:20  Angostura: I use a combination of TM and Mozy, FWIW
15:20 +Branes_: Time Machine can _reliably_ back up to a USB/FW drive, or a remote Mac, or a Time Capsule. Anything else is a hack, and not trustworthy because of the stupid, overly-complex manner in which TM stores its files.
15:30  Kasm279|Away: Branes_: what about eSATA drive? :P
15:44  web_knows: Tomis, increasing my macintosh hd partition :)
15:58  web_knows: this is
15:59  web_knows: insane
15:59  web_knows: my system is freezing again
15:59  web_knows: and I bet when I go check kernel.log, I'll see I/O errors
15:59 +Tomis: check low ram?
15:59  web_knows: 4 GB
15:59  web_knows: only 2 small apps opened
16:00 +Tomis: doens't mean you're not using it all
16:00  web_knows: doesn't look like it is a low ram issue, at all
16:02  web_knows: I even can't log into the laptop via SSH
16:03  web_knows: it's been frozen for 4 minutes now... beach ball spinning
16:03  web_knows: ssh timing out
16:03  web_knows: geez
16:03 * web_knows is pissed off
16:10 +Branes_: web_knows: this is sounding more and more like the logicboard's SATA controller is playing up, or you have a RAM issue.
16:12  web_knows: Branes_, would both had been missed on extended AHT testing?
16:14  zer0her0: Branes_: is there a way to test an old G4 Saw tooth's power button/front board?
16:14  zer0her0: or turn on the machine w/ a failing one?
16:18 +Branes_: Not easily - does it light when you press it, but then go off?
16:19 +Branes_: The usual culprit is the PSU in those
16:19  zer0her0: yea that's what i was afraid of
16:19  zer0her0: i'm getting nothing at all
16:20  zer0her0: It was running we turned it off to move it and swap some equipment around and plug a new monitor into it
16:20  zer0her0: now it won't boot.
16:21  web_knows:  
16:21 +Branes_: Which model of G4?
16:22  zer0her0: sawtooth
16:23 +Branes_: yeah, highly likely its the PSU then.
16:23 +Branes_: The rest of the machine is very robust
16:24  zer0her0: Branes_: that's what i figured as i literally have a pile of other G4s w/ dead PSUs
16:24  web_knows: wow
16:24  web_knows: sweet moly
16:24  zer0her0: ?
16:24  web_knows: i guess the culprit is transmission.app
16:25  web_knows: Branes_, Tomis 
16:25  web_knows: i was analyzing kernel.log
16:25  web_knows: and found: kernel kev_msg_pst returns 55
16:25 +Tomis: one user-space app being able to take down a whole system, is a system wide problem
16:25  web_knows: googled for it and found : http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=6662260
16:25  web_knows: all people on that thread are using transmission.app, which I'm loading up at login time
16:26  web_knows: that kernel kev_msg_pst returns 55 message started appearing on kernel.log today around the time the system got frozen
16:26  web_knows: no I/O errors this time though
16:28  web_knows: zer0her0, sorry, that was not for you
16:29 * zer0her0 cries
16:29  zer0her0: no one lovesme
16:29  web_knows: lol
16:31 +Branes_: Might pay to check you have the latest version - otherwise, see if someone in #transmissionx (I think that's the channel here) has any ideas
16:33  web_knows: nope
16:34  web_knows: nobody there
16:36  web_knows: #transmission
16:40  Myx0x3: hey guys, how does "Automatically Detect Proxy" work under settings? (sorry bad translation)
16:41  Myx0x3: i just made an dynamic tunnel to my server, but the i have to set up proxy every time in settnings under OS X
16:45  zer0her0: web_knows: there's an X there
16:52  17SAALS1C: hello

17:03  ayaz: After a year and a half of use, the keyboard on this MacBook is no longer conducive to proper touch typing.
17:08  RichardLynch: Why can I sudo mkdir /dev/shm and then sudo mkdir /dev/shm/cache, but sudo touch /dev/shm/cache/foo is "Operation not supported"?  I just want a fake /dev/shm for unit tests to work...
17:11  DarkStar1: Does anyone virtualise on their mbp?
17:12 @crilly|work: I have done.
17:27  DarkStar1: I'm having problem with virtualbox and installing ubuntu server edition
17:29  jeremyw: Feel free to elaborate.
17:29  DarkStar1: do I need a special version of ubuntu that can handle EFI?
17:32 @crilly|work: No.
17:32 @crilly|work: Just Ubuntu Server will do the job.
17:45  seivan: Ehm my mac sorta vibrates when it's plugged
17:45  seivan: I got a macbook air
17:46  seivan: When I drag my fingers across it's chassi elsewhere then the touchpadd
17:46  seivan: it sorta vibrates...
17:46  seivan: even if it's turned off
17:47  RichardLynch: Maybe they accidentally put that iPhone thinigie where it spins the monitor in it?
17:47  seivan: eh?
17:47  seivan: it has this weird buzzing feel
17:47  seivan: I fear it might be ground issues
17:47  seivan: anyone else experienced the same=
17:47  RichardLynch: that was a joke, sorry...
17:47  ahihi: that's normal if it's plugged into an ungrounded outlet
17:47  seivan: ahihi: well I changed outlet and it doesn't
17:47  seivan: The thing is
17:47  seivan: I got two macbook airs
17:48  seivan: One is going back to Apple, and the other one is replacing the one going back to Apple
17:48  seivan: The first one has that screen issue where it flickers once every time
17:48  Tu13es: seivan: are you using the 2-in or 3-pin plug on the magsafe?
17:48  seivan: and that one (connected to the same outlet) doesn't have that buzzing feel
17:48  Tu13es: for the one that feels liek grounding issues
17:48  seivan: Tu13es: 2 in
17:48  seivan: Tu13es: Swedish
17:48  seivan: THE THING is
17:48  seivan: I got two macbook airs
17:48  seivan: both using the same or different magsafes
17:48  seivan: so it isn't the outlet or the magsafes
17:49  seivan: because on the of the macbook airs doesn't do that
17:49  seivan: both 13 inches, 2010
17:49  Tu13es: weird
17:49  seivan: Should I be worried?
17:49  seivan: I've already sending one back, should I call again and have them replace the replacement?
17:49  Tu13es: anywho, i had an older MBP that had the grounding thing, I called apple and they said it was normal
17:49  ahihi: I've experienced it on all of my aluminium 'Books
17:49  Tu13es: we tested the voltage/amps across the chassis and it was negligible
17:49  RichardLynch: If I had to pick between screen flicker and grounding issue when you plug it into an ungrounded outlet, I'd send the flicker back, and not plug it into ungrounded outlets...  But that's just me.
17:49  Tu13es: i just started using the grounded plug and that solved it for me
17:49  zer0her0: yea sounds like grounding to me
17:50  seivan: so..
17:50  zer0her0: or proof that apple is using alien technology
17:50  seivan: where is the grounding at fault
17:50  seivan: it must be the macbook
17:50  seivan: Since two outlets, two macbooks, two magsafes
17:50  seivan: it only happens with that specific macbook
17:50 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
17:50  seivan: Tu13es: Maybe it was ngliglbe for you at that moment.
17:50  Tu13es: i don't remember the numbers, but they were incredibly small, just slightly noticible
17:50  Tu13es: as i said, i just switched to the grounded plug
17:51  seivan: but..
17:51  seivan: It's the macbook
17:51  seivan: not the outlet
17:51  Tu13es: right, but that's not saying that using a grounded plug wouldn't solve the issue
17:51  seivan: ...
17:51  Tu13es: or do you not have grounded plugs over there?
17:52  seivan: We do.
17:52  seivan: >_>
17:52  seivan: Dude I am telling 
17:52  seivan: It's not happening with the other macbook.
17:52  Tu13es: and it still feels the same when using the grounded plug?
17:52  seivan: yes
17:52  Tu13es: ok, so return it
17:52  seivan: our outlets
17:52  seivan: are grounded
17:52  seivan: damn >_>... third replacement then
17:53 * RichardLynch wonders how many people say that, but when it's opened up, the ground wire isn't, ummm, grounded... 
17:53  seivan: Still doesn't matter
17:53  seivan: I don't think you comprehend it.
17:53  seivan: Two macbooks, two magsafes, two outlets.
17:54  seivan: any combination will result in one macbook NOT having that feeling and the other one having that weird buzzing feeling
17:54  seivan: Ergo.. it's not the outlet
17:54  seivan: or the magsafe
17:54  RichardLynch: seivan: Sorry. I was not suggesting that you don't have real issue.  Was just musing in GENERAL about the statement.
17:54  seivan: Okay.
17:54  RichardLynch: Am I in the right channel to ask about OS X software issue?...  Seems to be all hardware/install...  
17:55  seivan:  go to #macosx but you can ask me
17:57  RichardLynch: sudo mkdir /dev/shm; sudo mkdir /dev/shm/cache; sudo touch /dev/shm/cache/foo     The last one says "Operation not supported"  Hunh?
17:59  seivan: did you try it in a one line.
17:59  seivan: just sudo touch /..../
18:03  RichardLynch: seivan: The directories don't exist, and they aren't in "one line" really.   It's just that I can mkdir, but not make a file.
18:03  seivan: I am not sure you can touch inside a dir that doens't exist
18:04  RichardLynch: Right.  So I made /dev/shm/ and I made /dev/shm/a and then touch a file in that dir, and I get "Operation not supported"
18:05  RichardLynch: Hmmm.  The /dev/shm dir I made yesterday is gone today!  Does OS X have just enough knowledge of Linux /dev/shm to nuke it on re-boot, but not enough to create it as a ramdisk or what?
18:07 --- Halloween is now known as antlong
18:11  cryptic0: anyone have experience with vmware fusion or parallels
18:14  jeremyw: Both, but I prefer VirtualBox.  VB was faster for me.
18:19  cryptic0: jeremyw:  I heard parallels integrates with mac
18:19  cryptic0: virtualbox stays in a window
18:19  jeremyw: Huh?
18:19  cryptic0: and gotta constantly use host key to engage mouse between mac and win
18:19  jeremyw: Not true.
18:19  cryptic0: which one?
18:19  jeremyw: All.
18:20  cryptic0: once inside guest, I can't get my mouse out unless I use the host key
18:20  jeremyw: VirtualBox can be Windowed or full screen and the host keys are automatic.
18:20  cryptic0: I am also having problems with setting resolution on virtualbox on my 13" mbp
18:21  cryptic0: for example 1280 resolution is too big, and 1024 is too small
18:21  jeremyw: Works fine here, install Guest Additions and then VirtualBox will do it dynamically.
18:21  cryptic0: what are guest additions?
18:21  jeremyw: Resize the window, or go full screen, and the guest resolution changes automatically.
18:21  jeremyw: The same thing VMWare and Parallels uses to make the guest integrate/runn better in OS X.
18:21  jeremyw: s/runn/run/
18:22  cryptic0: let me google
18:22  jeremyw: It's software/services/configurations that make VirtualBox integration into the OS better.
18:22  jeremyw: It's built into VirtualBox, there is a menu option for installing them.
18:28  cryptic0: jeremyw:  I am looking into it. gotta reboot the machine. thanks.
18:33  ErrantEgo: anyone around who can assist me in updating my iTouch's OS?
18:34  ErrantEgo: it wont update, and i dont know if thats because of the iTunes version i am running, or if its something totally different
18:34  ErrantEgo: I know iTunes 10 is out, but it wont run on my computer cause it requires 10.5
18:34  ErrantEgo: I'm not running 10.5
18:35  ErrantEgo: furthermore, I dont know if I need iTunes 10 to upgrade the iTouch's OS
18:35  ErrantEgo: anyone able to confirm or help w/that?
18:37  jeremyw: The iTunes version can impact the ability to update your iPhone.
18:37  jeremyw: s/iPhone/iTouch/
18:38  LordDragon: ErrantEgo, why not update your OS?
18:38  LordDragon: SL is only 30 bucks
18:39  ErrantEgo: LordDragon: the computer I have (1.42 GHz mac mini) runs like shit with anything newer than 10.4.11
18:39 +Tomis: get more ram
18:39  ErrantEgo: Tomis: maxed out
18:39  ErrantEgo: lol
18:39 +Tomis: get a new machine!
18:39  LordDragon: ErrantEgo, i have a 1.66mhz mac mini and SL runs faster than 10.5 did. SL has lots of speed increases
18:39  ErrantEgo: that computer only supports 1 GB afaik
18:39 +Tomis: i have 10.5 on a 1ghz g4 w/ 768
18:39 +Tomis: it's usable
18:40 * ErrantEgo shrugs
18:40  LordDragon: 10.4 is ancient history. lots of bugs, missing many modern features
18:40  ErrantEgo: well, that's the mac os
18:40  jeremyw: You'll hate this but install VirtualBox, boot Windows in VirtualBox, install latest iTunes and update that way.  Worth a try since updating your OS isn't an option.
18:40  ErrantEgo: what do i need to do to upgrade the iTouch's OS?
18:40  LordDragon: ErrantEgo, you need itunes 10 
18:40 +Tomis: get a new mac apparentlt ErrantEgo 
18:40  ErrantEgo: does that require iTunes 10>
18:40  ErrantEgo: ?'
18:40  jeremyw: Yup.
18:40  LordDragon: there is no alterntive
18:40  ErrantEgo: damn
18:40  jeremyw: iTunes 10.  I said this already.
18:40  ErrantEgo: jeremyw: missed it
18:40  ErrantEgo: my bad
18:40  jeremyw: No sweat.
18:41  ErrantEgo: my dad has a 2.26 GHz mac mini
18:41  ErrantEgo: but my iTouch isnt authorized on his computer
18:41 +Tomis: new iOS needs new itunes, new itunes needs new mac os x, new mac os x needs new mac, new mac feels lonely without a new iToy, which needs a new iOS, which needs a new iTunes, which needs a new mac os x.... and on and on and on
18:41 +Tomis: it's an intel mini ErrantEgo ?
18:41  jeremyw: Thank goodness for OTA Android updates.
18:42  ErrantEgo: Tomis: if youre willing to pay for the new mac, go for it
18:42  ErrantEgo: :P
18:42  jeremyw: You don't need another system at all.
18:42 +Tomis: which they never push out anyway jeremyw , lol
18:42  ErrantEgo: Tomis: *his* is, *mine* isnt
18:42  jeremyw: I just got one yesterday.
18:42  LordDragon: ErrantEgo, you dont need a new system dude. 10.6 will run fine on yours the way it is
18:42  ErrantEgo: LordDragon: no it wont
18:42 +Tomis: what device jeremyw ?
18:43  ErrantEgo: LordDragon: snow leopard requires an intel processor -- my computer only has a G4 :-P
18:43 +Tomis: i wouldn't run 10.6 on less then 2GB
18:43 +Tomis: 4GB prefered
18:43  jeremyw: Tomis: Droid
18:43  LordDragon: lolz
18:43  LordDragon: ppc
18:43  ErrantEgo: ja
18:43 * Tomis is listening to Circus by Britney Spears from Circus (✮✮✮✮✩)
18:43  LordDragon: ErrantEgo, ok then you DO need a new mac :P
18:43  ErrantEgo: hell, if it makes you laugh more, I IRC on a B&W G3/400 :P
18:44  ErrantEgo: oldie but goodire
18:44  ErrantEgo: goodie*
18:44  thegoat: i recently purchased a new macbook pro, and it came with iLife.  now i wiped it cause i don't want all the bs that comes pre-installed.  i don't use iphoto on the macbook so i wanted to install it on my macPro.  when i pop in dvd, it tells me ilfe can't be installed on the macPro...is there anyway around it?
18:44  ErrantEgo: LordDragon: sometime in the (hopefully) near future, I am looking into purchasing a MBP
18:45  jeremyw: thegoat: No.  Bundled software will only install on the hardware you had the OS/software bundled for.
18:45  LordDragon: thegoat, yes. the way around it is to buy ilife and install it
18:45  jeremyw: I'm sure you can work around it in some way but it won't be easy.
18:46 +Tomis: yea, go buy ilife in the store thegoat 
18:46  thegoat: but i am licensed for the copy i have, i just don't want to use it on the machine it came with
18:46  LordDragon: yes, he wiped to get rid of all the stuff that comes preinstalled on macs, like OSX and iLife. cuz thats all that it comes with
18:46 +Tomis: yes, licensed for it on the machine it came with
18:46 +Tomis: hence not being able to instal it on a different machine
18:47  LordDragon: thegoat, that ilife is only designed for the macbookpro. there is no way around this. you must buy ilife for the macpro. check out apple.com or go to an authorized apple store
18:47 +Tomis: of course if you hadn't gone and deleted it you could have easily copied it over to the other mac, lol
18:47  LordDragon: haha
18:47  jeremyw: Bundled software is licensed on the hardware that it came with.  Sorry man.
18:47 +Tomis: saved a whole 200MB!
18:47 +Tomis: woo
18:47 +Tomis: safari? what's that, must be some game, deleted!
18:47  thegoat: that's what i figured.  thought the licensing would allow me to do that.
18:47 +Tomis: utilities? don't need 'em deleted!
18:48 +Tomis: now where's my web browser on this thing
18:48  LordDragon: hahahaha
18:48  LordDragon: "whats this gay background picture? DELETED!"
18:48  infojunky: thegoat: yes. go buy what you already bought. be a good consumer (rather than torrent it, like you really should)
18:48  ErrantEgo: whats the difference btw 4.1 and 4.2?
18:48  LordDragon: torrenting is illegal and not allowed in here
18:48 +Tomis: they fixed a bunch of crap ErrantEgo 
18:48 +Tomis: heh
18:48  ErrantEgo: figures
18:49 +Tomis: you can probably find the change log on apple.com?
18:49  ErrantEgo: well i guess i'm sol till i can get my hands on a new ocmputer
18:49  thegoat: i am.  i don't torrent things.  lord knows what kind of crap people pack into them.
18:49  ErrantEgo: aint too big a deal
18:49  ErrantEgo: im not going to die over it
18:49 +Tomis: 4.1 has multitasking right?
18:49  ErrantEgo: idk
18:49 +Tomis: heh
18:49 +Tomis: what model iToy is it again?
18:50  ErrantEgo: iToy? rofl
18:50  thegoat: i wasn't trying to do anything illegal, i thought that maybe the license would allow me to move it to another machine
18:50  ErrantEgo: define "model"
18:50 +Tomis: iphone 1st gen, etc.
18:50  ErrantEgo: oh, hm
18:50  ErrantEgo: it says MB531LL
18:51 +Tomis: woa now, not that specific
18:51 +Tomis: make me go google it and crap
18:51  ErrantEgo: heh thats what it says under "About"
18:51  ErrantEgo: lol
18:51  ErrantEgo: i think its 2nd gen
18:51  ErrantEgo: but dont hold me to that
18:51 +Tomis: 16gb ipod touch 2nd gen
18:51 +Tomis: top hit on google
18:51 +Tomis: i'm always gonna ask people that now
18:51  ErrantEgo: heh there ya go
18:51  ErrantEgo: i was right :D
18:51 +Tomis: jsut give me the damn model number!
18:51  ErrantEgo: woohoo :p
18:51  ErrantEgo: lol
18:52  ErrantEgo: well scuuuuuuuuuuuse me
18:52  ErrantEgo: :P
18:52 +Tomis: yea, the 2nd gen doesn't get multitasking
18:52 +Tomis: so 4.x is kinda a wash there
18:53 +Tomis: supposedly there were performance issues with it on those older devices that they later fixed in 4.2.x or something
18:53  ErrantEgo: i aint gonna worry about it
18:53  ErrantEgo: i like the fact that i can put my apps into specific folders
18:53  ErrantEgo: but other than that, im not going to lose any sleep over the upgrade
