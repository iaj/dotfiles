06:16 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 81 seconds
06:30  londonmet050: when you do cmd+backspace
06:30  londonmet050: trying to delete stuff
06:30  londonmet050: u get propmt
06:30  londonmet050: asking for ok or cancel
06:31  londonmet050: like u want to sure delete this
06:31  londonmet050: before I can just enter since the OK button is highlighted
06:31  londonmet050: but now cancel is highlighted
06:32  londonmet050: so I have to use mouse to click on OK
06:33  FriedBob: londonmet050: Could just hit tab
06:33  londonmet050: it wont work
06:33  LSD`: Why not Shift+Tab to get back to OK? Also, I seem to recall that Enter doesn't do the trick for confirmation under OS X, but I'm not 100% on that
06:34  londonmet050: it is like cancel and delete
06:34  londonmet050: but shift+tab wont change to
06:36  londonmet050: i think onyx did something
06:36  londonmet050: damn

08:50  richardcavell: Can I just say publicly: I seriously love this 1Password program.  Buy it, for God's sake.  Best $40 US I ever spent.
08:50  CEnTR4L: I have seen many folks loving the app too, personally I never did, yet.

08:51  CEnTR4L: Great, now Safari is stuck on the spinning rainbow-beach ball.
08:51 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
08:51  b3ny0-: I hate that ball
08:52 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 78 seconds
08:52  CEnTR4L: Who doesn't hate that ball?
08:52  musicanna: there is a website dedicated to tallying up all the time wasted with the spinning beachball of death
08:52  CEnTR4L: Oh yes, I know the answer, Windoze users.
08:52  musicanna: let me see if I can find it
08:52  b3ny0-: its understandable that the computer has to load at times though
08:53  CEnTR4L: b3ny0-, 1.43 free ram out of 4GB, only two tabs were open.
08:54  Pawnee: musicanna: http://marbleofdoom.com/
08:54  musicanna: Yep!! that's the site
08:54  b3ny0-: dunno if the timeglass in windows is less annoying though
08:54  musicanna: at least it doesn't have an eyesore spinning rainbow
08:55  b3ny0-: my application wasn't featured :/
08:56  b3ny0-: heh
08:56  b3ny0-: does apple know about that page
08:57  musicanna: which app unleashed the pinwheel bomb on ya?
08:57  b3ny0-: ableton live does it 
08:57  b3ny0-: a lot
08:57  b3ny0-: when you work with bigger projects
08:57  b3ny0-: move clips and you'll wait a minute for that satanic ball to spin
08:58  b3ny0-: its not surprising that Bloatfox is numero uno
08:58  b3ny0-: :)
08:58  musicanna: I'd probably say between the apps I use, firefox and safari and iphoto are the top apps to bomb on me like that.
08:58  manda_moore: iphoto never gives me the pinwheel
08:58  manda_moore: or safari (unless i come across a flash site....)
08:59  b3ny0-: chrome very rarely gives me the wheel
08:59  musicanna: well, the site's been open since '07. Imagine how many people also submitted their tally when ff 3.5.x was out there more times that thing hung than it didn't.
08:59  b3ny0-: even when I have ****loads of stuff open
08:59 * musicanna is on a ppc mac with older versions of photo and safari. 
09:04  b3ny0-: but ableton is always sluggish
09:04  b3ny0-: no matter what computer I've run it on
09:04  b3ny0-: its a shame it has the best and fastest UI, otherwise there are more optimized alternatives
09:06  Branes: b3ny0-: best machine I've found so far to run Live on is an AMD 6-core.
09:11  b3ny0-: it depends a lot on what kind of stuff you do too
09:11  b3ny0-: some plugs are really demanding
09:18  Branes: For all its size, Omnisphere is actually quite light on load. Arturia instruments are often very greedy.
09:18  b3ny0-: never likd arturia
09:20  b3ny0-: oh nice
09:20  b3ny0-: ace is available for osx now
09:22  Branes: Arturia's CS80V is very faithful to the original, sonically, and I can't pick between the JP-8V and the real Jupiter-8 I have.
09:23  Branes: Their Moog emulations leave something to be desired, though.
09:23  b3ny0-: I mostly use sylenth1, albino 3, v-station and vanguard
09:23  b3ny0-: for software
09:24  b3ny0-: got some hw stuff too, the plugs are mostly for fillins
09:24  Branes: Sylenth is very flexible. Have you tried the Ultra-Analog AS-1?
09:25  b3ny0-: nope
09:25  b3ny0-: om/ultraanalog/overview/
09:25  b3ny0-: oops
09:25  b3ny0-: http://www.applied-acoustics.com/ultraanalog/overview/
09:25  b3ny0-: this?
09:25  Branes: That's the one.
09:25  b3ny0-: most stuff I do with machinedrum and ion
09:26  Branes: Has a good, well-rounded sonic palette, and doesn't sound like a Japanese analogue like most other "analog" virtuals.
09:26  b3ny0-: I am not that crazy about the moog soun
09:26  b3ny0-: d
09:26  b3ny0-: it sounds fantastic on its own
09:26  b3ny0-: but I find it hard to fit in my stuff
09:26  Branes: What's your style?
09:27  b3ny0-: tribal, prog
09:28  b3ny0-: http://soundcloud.com/synestheticmusic/soundventure-soundventure-demo
09:28  Branes: Mmm, def worth a listen. Una moment :)
09:29  b3ny0-: its a track a mate and I did for our joint project
09:30  Branes: Whilst I wait for that to download, what are your influences?
09:31  b3ny0-: I dunno, I listen to a lot of great artists, but its rarely in the same category as my own
09:31  Branes: Not a bad thing :)
09:31  b3ny0-: but my favourites would be Richard D James, Venetian Snares, Burial, Autechre
09:31  b3ny0-: and stuff like that
09:31  b3ny0-: at the moment
09:32  Branes: heh, dig out the Warp back-catalog :)
09:32  b3ny0-: I used to listen to loads of similar stuff to what we make today, now its enough for me to make it
09:32  b3ny0-: huge ambient fan as well
09:33  Branes: Mmm, sounds like a cross between Vaishiyas and One Tasty Morsel
09:35  Branes: Not much happening in the bottom end, the kick sounds like it's been put through a highpass.
09:36  b3ny0-: we mixed it at my friends place, he hasn't got the best equipment
09:36  Branes: It shows. An awful lot happening in the mids & upper mids.
09:37  b3ny0-: http://drop.io/grfaspo/asset/soundventures-afrodiseqmixdemo4mixxxersxz2-m4a
09:37  b3ny0-: here is a wip I've mixed at my house a bit
09:39  Branes: What are you using for audio monitoring?
09:39  b3ny0-: Yamaha HS80m
09:39  b3ny0-: and Audio-Technica ATH-M50
09:40 * Branes winces
09:41  b3ny0-: winces?
09:41  Branes: Never been a fan of the Yamaha sound, they're always too sharp, thanks to their plastic diaphragm and stiff spider
09:41  b3ny0-: I like it
09:42  b3ny0-: a side-effect however is that most other speakers sound muddy 
09:42  b3ny0-: I didn't like the NS10s
09:42  b3ny0-: but noone really does
09:43  Branes: You should look at something with a less coloured sound, Adam A7's or the latest 10" Truths aren't too bad for the money.
09:43  b3ny0-: my next pair will probably be from ino audio/guru
09:44  Branes: mm, that m4a snip sounds a *lot* better.
09:45  b3ny0-: I haven't really got money for new speakers for a forseeable future though
09:45  Branes: Well, do your mixing at home instead of your mate's, the full demo track has shocking production compared your own effort
09:46  Branes: Re-do the mixdown on it, then submit it to ektoplazm
09:47  b3ny0-: we have loads of stuff that needs finishing
09:47  b3ny0-: know a good friend who is an engineer
09:47  Branes: There's a dearth of good minimal dark, get crackin' :)
09:48  b3ny0-: my solo stuff cater more to the techno-stuff, my friend is a lot into psy
09:48  b3ny0-: so we try to merge them a bit where possible
09:48  Branes: Not a bad thing
09:48  b3ny0-: the machinedrum is pretty central in my work
09:49  b3ny0-: most things I come up with were born on that :)
09:49  b3ny0-: next year we're gonna start studying to become engineers
09:50  b3ny0-: both self-taught so a little official know-how couldn't hurt could it
09:51  Branes: Not suprised, I've spend a few enjoyable hours with the sps1, very powerful yet has a good interface (compared to a lot of things)
09:51  b3ny0-: best interface of all the gear I own (and have tried)
09:52  Branes: Certainly beats trying to make music with a mouse :)
09:52  b3ny0-: and multiple outputs too, so its perfect for routing into live
09:54  b3ny0-: what soundcard do you use? I'm afraid I have to replace mine again
09:57  Branes: I'm still using an older (pre Avid) M-Audio Delta PCI in the windows machine for that. If you can afford it, MOTU Ultralite or the RME Fireface 400 are really excellent (you do need a Texas Instruments based FireWire interface for them though)
09:57  b3ny0-: I have the Ultralite
09:57  b3ny0-: and I'm having issues
09:57  Branes: Original model?
09:57  b3ny0-: no the mk3 hybrid
09:57  b3ny0-: I want the fireface 400, but its so expensive
09:58  Branes: You keeping the clock at 48kHz? The Hybrid and its predecessor have odd quirks if you try and run them at something other than 48k.
09:59  Branes: The Presonus stuff has a happy following, and Mackie's interfaces are pretty damn good as well.
09:59  b3ny0-: really?
09:59  b3ny0-: I have run it on 44 so far
09:59  Branes: Keep it and your DAW at 48k internal, that's what they're all designed for.
10:00  b3ny0-: I thought I had changed that
10:00  b3ny0-: but apparently not
10:00 --- iTruc_ is now known as iTruc
10:00  b3ny0-: the problem I've had is that it can randomly emit a high-pitched beeping noise
10:00  b3ny0-: in the middle of a project, freezing the hole computer temporarely
10:00  Branes: That sounds like a clock issue.
10:00  b3ny0-: whole*
10:01  Branes: Double check the brand of chip used on your 1394 interface, if it's not TI, get one that *is* TI.
10:01  Branes: And try running the MOTU and Live at 48k
10:01  b3ny0-: I use usb atm
10:02  b3ny0-: I'm waiting for a fw cable to arrive
10:02  b3ny0-: they only sent the old one
10:02  Branes: Bugger.
10:02  b3ny0-: I'm on a laptop
10:03  b3ny0-: I'll try changing sample rate, see if that takes care of it
10:03  Branes: If you have to use USB for audio, make sure that you have as few other devices on the same USB hub as you can. Bear in mind a lot of modern laptops will have some internal systems connect via USB (webcams and keyboards, usually, will show up as a USB peripheral)
10:03  Branes: Which laptop are you using?
10:04  Branes: (and which OS?)
10:04  b3ny0-: macbook pro 13"
10:04  Branes: Which gen?
10:04  b3ny0-: osx snow leopard
10:04  b3ny0-: the latest I guess
10:04  b3ny0-: I bought it about two months ago
10:04  b3ny0-: not very knowledgeable about macs really, this is my first one
10:04  Branes: Ah ... thats a pity, the onboard firewire in those are made of camel-spit and monkey vomit :(
10:05  b3ny0-: perhaps I should stick with the usb?
10:05  Branes: You might have to, the Agere chip Apple are using these days cannot do hard-sync clock, which makes them almost useless for audio :(
10:06  b3ny0-: that sucks
10:06  Branes: Tell me about it.
10:06  b3ny0-: perhaps I should look for a fireface usb then, if I can't get this motu to stop malfunctioning
10:07  Branes: One of my (many) hats is computer music tuition & system design. RME identified the Agere timing issue a bit over nine months ago, and Apple still have done jack about it -- the only solution, if you want to go portable with OSX for music-making, is to buy the behemoth, the MacBook Pro 17, and get a Texas Instruments based ExpressCard firewire controller.
10:07  b3ny0-: yeah and that's way out of my league
10:08  b3ny0-: both in price and portabiliy
10:08  iaj: Lo there - hmm can someone tell me if theres SOME way to make itunes forward some seconds, or rewind, via applescript?
10:08  b3ny0-: a friend of mine has fireface usb and it works great for him
10:08  b3ny0-: he's on win7 though
10:09  Branes: What's going to impact you is that to stay with USB, you're going to have to be *really* careful about how many audio signals you try & get it to run. Four lines is the safe limit, six lines is the maximum and that's pushing it. (one stereo pair is two lines, either in or out)
10:09  b3ny0-: theoretically usb has a higher band-width than fw400
10:10  Branes: Theoretically, but that doesn't take into account either packet overhead (huge) or CPU load (high).
10:10  b3ny0-: I will probably use a max of 16 in
10:10  b3ny0-: and rarely every channel at once
10:11  b3ny0-: I have sold quite a lot of gear, I have about 5 synths left 
10:11  b3ny0-: that I just can't part with
10:11  b3ny0-: ;)
10:11  Branes: That's not going to work out well for you I'm afraid - not via USB, at any rate.
10:11  b3ny0-: it has worked fine for most part, except for that beeping issue
10:12  b3ny0-: sometimes I can work for hours and record and it doesn't happen at all
10:12  Branes: If going back to 48k doesn't alleviate that, reduce the number of inputs active at any one time.
10:12  b3ny0-: sometimes it happens 5 minutes after I've started
10:12  b3ny0-: I have closed down all unused inputs/outputs
10:13  Branes: As odd as this may sound coming from someone in a Mac channel, you might be better off bootcamping the MBP with XP or 7. I am still not happy with the way CoreAudio works with 10.5 & 10.6
10:14  b3ny0-: I don't do THAT much real-time recording
10:14  b3ny0-: in fact, its quite rare
10:14  b3ny0-: mostly I just program a sound and record clips into live
10:14  b3ny0-: and then match them into the mix
10:14  b3ny0-: so its not a huge problem, yet
10:15  LSD`: Branes: to be fair though, you haven't been happy with anything Apple have done since about 1997
10:15  Branes: Not only can it seem to hiccup inexplicably, but there's still some bizarro link between audio glitchiness & clock-loss and the OSX kernel's method of implementing speedstep on the CPU for load-balancing.
10:15  b3ny0-: I thought OSX was supposed to be superior for audio
10:15  Branes: It was, until early 2007.
10:15  b3ny0-: I have a desktop PC with XP which I used up until 2 months ago
10:16  Branes: Then they screwed the pooch both with the software (CoreAudio) and the hardware (losing TI in favour of the shit-nasty AGere garbage)
10:16  b3ny0-: but I paired it with a dreadful soundcard
10:42 --- Mission-Critical is now known as MissionCritical
11:08  vatson: hi
11:09  vatson: what time tracker you can recommend?
11:23  iaj: hmm can someone tell me if theres SOME way to make itunes forward some seconds, or rewind, via applescript? or some other kinda app?
11:25  Branes: Why, you trying to create an automated Daft Punk remix of something? :)
11:26  b3ny0-: Branes: have you tried the Softube plugs?
11:27  Branes: Probably. Can't say they stick in my mind for any reason.
11:28  Branes: If I want to 'warm' the sound up, I'll use analogue circuitry, not some faux modelling thing.
11:28  b3ny0-: they make the best eq/comp plugins I've heard
11:28  Branes: Moogerfooger ftqw
11:29  b3ny0-: don't dismiss something you haven't tried ;)
11:30  b3ny0-: normally I'd agree, but these plugs are really in a class of its own
11:31  Branes: I prefer to avoid using compression wherever possible.
11:32  Branes: And if you craft the original sounds properly, you shouldn't need EQ either :)
11:32  Branes: It's not the sounds in the music that are important, it's the silences.
11:34  b3ny0-: the way I see it, its for coloration
11:34  b3ny0-: for instace, the focusing eq is more of an effect to me, for adding stuff like saturation or mild clipping
11:35 * Branes shakes his head
11:35  b3ny0-: its fun and interesting to experiment with different things, and often you find great new things and learn more
11:35  Branes: Any EQing done at the mixing console only ever fixes mistakes in the original signal.
11:35  b3ny0-: the worst thing I know is this by-the-books thinking
11:36  Branes: Seeing EQ as a repair tool isn't something you'd find in an SAE textbook :)
11:37  b3ny0-: to me, its the result that matters, you can have guidelines, but one should look at the possibilities for each device
11:37  Branes: And the fewer the devices, the better. Lack of limitations can be very dangerous." -- Jean Michel Jarre.
11:37  b3ny0-: I like limitations
11:38  b3ny0-: that's why I have a few plugs I know well installed instead of just cramming in as much as I can
11:38  Branes: Wise.
11:38  b3ny0-: but you don't always have to resort to using everything the way the manufacturer ment
11:38  Branes: Oh, hell no! :)
11:39  Branes: That's why most of my own instruments are almost as old as I am :)
11:39  b3ny0-: I like the vintage stuff
11:39  b3ny0-: but from my view, its too costly in most cases
11:39  LSD`: Branes: they're made of stone, sabre tooth tiger and mammoth skins?
11:39  b3ny0-: I'm planning on building a modular this winter
11:41  b3ny0-: I don't give a damn wether something is old, new, digital, analog, a real instrument or a mere childs toy, if it makes an interesting sound that can add to the picture than that's all I need :)
11:41 * Branes has two CS-70M's, a Jupiter 8, a Jem SX-90, a full System 100, two Juno 106's, two SH-5a's, an original XPander, a VCS3, and the only member of the family less than twenty years old, a Prophet 08.
11:42  Branes: If it doesn't have a front panel full of knobs, I can't use it. its the other half of the instrument :)
11:42  b3ny0-: my current line-up would be Elektron Machinedrum UW Mk2, Alesis Ion, Korg MS2000, MAM MB33 II and ADX1
11:42  Sterist: what filesystems can Snow Leopard be installed on?
11:42  b3ny0-: as well as a NES with MIDINES cart
11:42  b3ny0-: :)
11:42  Sterist: formats'
11:42  Branes: Sterist: HFS Extended, HFS Extended (Journaled) only
11:43  Sterist: if i dual boot ubuntu with it, would i be able to access that format? 
11:43  Sterist: those'
11:43  Sterist: lol
11:44  b3ny0-: http://softube.se/passive_active_pack/FocusingEqualizer_Screenshot.png
11:44  Branes: Running Ubuntu directly on Apple's slightly-but-annoyingly-custom hardware is never a good idea. Use a virtual machine.
11:44  b3ny0-: this is my favourite on basses
11:44  LSD`: Linux has HFS support, HFS+ is flaky though last I checked. Not a problem if you install it in a VM with folder sharing extensions
11:45  Branes: Sterist: Inel CPU != generic-class PC. Apple's stuff is non-standard.
11:45  Sterist: HFS+ is "journaled" i take it?
11:45  Branes: Only if you choose it to be so.
11:45  b3ny0-: really look forward to start a modular
11:45  LSD`: HFS Extended is HFS+, journaling is an addition
11:45  Sterist: yes i have an intel. my dad has a spare snow leopard install disc from work
11:45  Branes: OSX 10.6 requires journalling, so the default is HFS Extended (Journaled).
11:45  LSD`: HFS+ is to HFS what FAT32 was to FAT, essentially
11:46  Sterist: that makes sense.
11:46  Branes: Sterist: Just use the OSX installer that came with your Mac.
11:46  Branes: b3ny0-: Got any designs you're looking at?
11:47 * Branes is quite fond of the old Serge and Paia circuits
11:47  b3ny0-: I'm gonna start out small and simple, one 3HU 19" case with PSU, a MIDI-CV conv and a Doepfer A-111-5 module
11:47  Sterist: i don't have a mac, windows 7 was pre installed on here. right now i got ubuntu and win7, and have an unused snow leopard disc
11:47  b3ny0-: just so its a working starter
11:47  Branes: Sterist: Mac OS X will only work on Apple hardware.
11:47  Sterist: tri-boot :)
11:47  Sterist: gah!
11:47  b3ny0-: you can go hackintosh though
11:47  Branes: Anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot.
11:47  b3ny0-: I haven't tried it though
11:47 * Sterist looks at the IRC chat topic
11:47  Branes: hackintossing is never stable.
11:48  Sterist: i guess i can't get help on that here lol
11:48  b3ny0-: that's what I suspected
11:49  b3ny0-: http://soundcloud.com/svartvittalbok/lullaby-for-androids-portastudio-144
11:49 --- iannic_ is now known as iannic
11:49  b3ny0-: this is a track I made in live, then recorded onto my old portastudio, then back again :)
11:50  Branes: Doepfer still make some lovely stuff. Ever heard of the artist Ubar Tmar, b3ny? He does psytrance -- really good thumbpy warped stuff - all live with a bunch of Doepfer gear and a pair of Echoplexes.
11:50  Branes: If you can find Rhythmism, get it.
11:50  b3ny0-: I was hoping to build a portable modular
11:50  Branes: No computers, no tape recorders.
11:50  b3ny0-: well, carriable though
11:51  b3ny0-: I've made a few sets with just Machinedrum, MB33 and ADX
11:51  b3ny0-: before I had a laptop
11:55  b3ny0-: is there vids on his performances
11:56  Branes: I've seen one, a friend is a big fan and ordered a VHS of one performance from Japan.
12:11  Malicai: Hey guys what do I do if my mac's screen colors are inverted? I knew I shouldn't have left my computer alone with my 14 year old son >.>. He insists he didn't do anything to it but ... I doubt that. Any help? Thanks!
12:12  b3ny0-: isn't that located in the handicap aids
12:12  Malicai: I think that's black and white setting if I remember right, not inverted colors.
12:12  b3ny0-: they have this inverted colours for visually impaired
12:12  b3ny0-: yep there it is
12:13  Malicai: Umm... how do I access handicap aids? Sorry, I am new to macs.
12:13  b3ny0-: me too :)
12:13  b3ny0-: settings -> handicap aids
12:13  Malicai: Alright, give me a sec..
12:13  b3ny0-: dunno what it says in english exactly, I'm on the swe version
12:14  Malicai: Umm... okay... well it's not inverted now since I removed inverted colors... umm
12:14  Malicai: My computer is well... the display is... it all seems to be in a shade of pinkish... just really abnormal and pinkish. Everything...
12:14  Malicai: Any ideas?
12:15  b3ny0-: bad display?
12:15  Malicai: Well it wasn't like this a few hours ago when I left my computer alone, I came back to an inverted screen, and I guess I just disabled it and now this..
12:15  mikeplus64: Wipe the jam off your eyes, Malicai.
12:15  Malicai: Excuse me?
12:15  Branes: Malicai: Shut the computer down, then start it up again.
12:15  darkf: Your kid probably broke your Mac and inverted it :-)
12:16  mikeplus64: Malicai: If you have jam on your eyes, you may see things in a pinkish colour only.
12:16  Malicai: Hold on, I see some silly putty on the back of the computer - it is pink colored, maybe it is masking some sort of display mechanism, give me a sec and I'll remove it and get back to you guys; thanks again!
12:16  Branes: Screen inversion settings can be found in System Preferences -< Universal Access.
12:17  Malicai: Alright all, it looks fine now, thanks! Turns out the silly putty was very lightly covering my monitor, so the display was pink shaded because of that... I am really tired, hard day at work, although I am surprised I didn't notice that.
12:18  Malicai: Woops now it's purple
12:19  Malicai: Hold on let me get the jam out of my eyes, thanks for that mike.
12:19  Branes: 1) don't leave your laptop where junior can get to it again, 2) ban him from the internet from all other computers in the house for a week.
12:19  Malicai: Alright all good, thanks guys.
12:19  Malicai: Thanks I will give him a spanking, bye all.
12:24  cYmen: Is there a run-dialogue kind of thing on macs?
12:24  LSD`: cYmen: Cmd+Space :P
12:25  b3ny0-: darnit, I hate being broke
12:25  cYmen: LSD`: hm... isn't that a bit slow for that purpose?
12:26  LSD`: cYmen: compared to what? Call it up, type a few characters of the app you want, hit enter and you;re done
12:26  cYmen: mh okay
12:27  LSD`: It's about the only thing Spotlight is good for in Leopard and beyond
12:27  Branes: You can't issue commands via the Spotlight system like you can with Windows' Run box, you need to open Terminal for that.
12:28  LSD`: Does anybody actually use the windows run box for that though? Not being able to see if a command completed successfuly or not is annoying
12:29  cYmen: LSD`: but it must also be faster because there is no searching or lookups involved
12:29  cYmen: It probably doesn't matter 99.9% of the time and if this machine wasn't so damn slow all the time I wouldn't even think about it.
12:30  LSD`: cYmen: again, faster than what? It's infinitely more convenient than digging through the filesystem in finder and, because it's a global shortcut, is accessible quickly from anywhere, so beats going for the Dock or the desktop too
12:31  LSD`: Spotlight can also find apps anywhere it has indexed, the Windows run box is limited to the search path which is usually just %WINDIR%\System32 and little else
12:32  LSD`: It's pretty much all I use for launching apps on OS X now
12:32  b3ny0-: time for meeting with the doctor
12:34  cYmen: LSD`: I mean faster in terms of computing time.
12:43  Psixerces: LSD` - In most cases, I use run to launch apps, or if I want feedback, I launch command.    And Run can be extended if you update the path var's.    On OS X - again - spotlight will launch apps, and open terminal for feedback
12:43  Psixerces: the advantage spotlight has is that it allows you to display results as you type the char's
12:43  Psixerces: run requires an exact match
12:43  Psixerces: however, in windows 7 its improved dramatically and functions like spotlight does
12:43  Psixerces: but you don't call run, you just use the search field
13:34  cYmen: Is there a way to make the remote scroll in preview?
13:37  Angostura: ?
13:37  Angostura: The remote what?
13:37  cYmen: The remote control that came with my macbook...
13:40  Angostura: You'll probably need something liek http://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/
13:41  Angostura: Or http://www.filewell.com/iRedLite/
13:51  MrUnagi: Good morning
13:55  ayaz: G'morning, MrUnagi!

14:30  mrunagi: Good morning to all
14:30  ChrisAM: well hello thar
14:31  mrunagi: Hi chrisam
14:31  mrunagi: How are you
14:31  ChrisAM: not sure yet.
14:31  ChrisAM: I'll know once the coffee kicks in.
14:31  mrunagi: Just woke up?
14:32  mrunagi: Ha ha I have my starbucks as we speak
14:32  mrunagi: Though they can't seem to get it right anymore....this one is one of the best
14:33  mrunagi: So I'm happy....of course that could be the meds
14:40  bassliner: so is there any way to still be able to type e.g. ~ or @ (which i access via alt-l or alt-n) when i use alt as meta in Terminal.app?
14:47  ae86-drifter: anyone know how to create custom ribbons in mac office 2011?
14:49  ae86-drifter: and is there a tool to create a custom package that installs 5 different printers all in one hit?
14:59  mustardseed: hello everyone i have a new MBP connected to a 30"apple cinema display via a dual DVI/USB adapter; i have the max res and the display sometimes gets a blur, ie. all writing turns into mere dots, etc. thanks for your help
15:00  ae86-drifter: i thought new MBP have displayports?
15:01  mustardseed: mini only so no use for 30"
15:04  ae86-drifter: why not? how exactly is it connected to your MBP ?
15:05  mustardseed: via a dual dvi adaptr, so it uses the mini display and usb port 
15:06  ae86-drifter: you shouldnt need the usb part for the display to work, is it the genuine apple cable?
15:07  ae86-drifter: the usb is just a pass thru for the ports on the back
15:09  mustardseed: it's all apple, the cables, the adaptor, etc. and yes you need the usb cable from the adapter to work, otherwise no image, i tried it 
15:15  ae86-drifter: oh k really, werid, not on the mac pro we have i think the monitors are older though it has usb & firewire passthru
15:16  ae86-drifter: r u usin 10.6.4?
15:17  ae86-drifter: u could try turnin off opengl
15:17  ae86-drifter: or try another adapter, i had one die a week ago
15:17  ae86-drifter: $49 each too
15:20  mustardseed: yep am on 10.6.4 and firewire does not come through the dual DVI , so it's a sucker for the isight as well
15:25  Kasm279|Away: ae86-drifter: no apple monitors have foirewire anything
15:26  Kasm279|Away: and the USB is for powre i think
15:27  jwocky: why is snow leopard so much cheaper than leopard was?  is it a full os or an upgrade?
15:27 --- topriddy_ is now known as topriddy
15:28  Kasm279|Away: jwocky: upgrade
15:28  Kasm279|Away: apple hasn't released a non-upgrade disc o.O
15:29  jwocky: Kasm279: so you need a machine with leopard first?
15:29  Zelfje: wrong, on a new mac you only get snowy
15:29  Kasm279|Away: or tiger intel
15:30  jwocky: if i have a mac with no os, can i just buy snow leopard or do i need to install leopard first?
15:31  Kasm279|Away: jwocky: you need to install leo first
15:31  jwocky: bummer.  thanks for the info!
15:32  Zelfje: nonsense, you can just buy from applestore and install snowy
15:33  jwocky: basically i bought a machine from a friend with a new hdd, can i go stright to snow leopard or do i need leopard first?
15:33  Kasm279|Away: Zelfje: you have to have tiger or leo on the machine first
15:33  Kasm279|Away: you need leo first
15:33  Zelfje: if it is intel based you can just go for snowy
15:34  Kasm279|Away: or if its an older machine you can upgrade from tiger if you want
15:34  Kasm279|Away: wait
15:34  jwocky: it's intel
15:34  Kasm279|Away: the $29 thing is upgrade only
15:34  Zelfje: $49 family pack ^^
15:34  Kasm279|Away: i think the boxed set with ilife will install without a previous OS
15:34  Kasm279|Away: we were talking about the upgrade disc Zelfje :P
15:35  jwocky: oh but there is a full verion of snow leopard?
15:35  Zelfje: yeah but you dont need to ;)
15:35  Kasm279|Away: yeah i think the boxed set is
15:35  Kasm279|Away: >.> too bad Branes isn't here
15:35  Kasm279|Away: he could tell us
15:35  jwocky: i see
15:35  Kasm279|Away: i mean
15:35  Kasm279|Away: the upgrade disc is the full version
15:36  Kasm279|Away: it just requires you have something on the hard drive first
15:36  ae86-drifter: i used the upgrade disk and formatted a tiger machine with it before installin snow
15:36  Kasm279|Away: yeah
15:36  Kasm279|Away: you can erase and install
15:36  ae86-drifter: the $29 one
15:36  Zelfje: no need to do that, just inset the disk and install snowy
15:37  ae86-drifter: format only takes 1 min anyway
15:37  jwocky: i don't have an existing os on the hdd though
15:37  jwocky: will i need the $169 box set then?
15:38  ae86-drifter: yep
15:38  Zelfje: if you want to use the i-crap
15:38  ae86-drifter: unless u can get it alone somewhere..
15:39  ae86-drifter: image thru firewire from another mac
15:39  jwocky: would i still need to buy a license?
15:39  ae86-drifter: can u use target disk mode with no OS ?
15:40  KaOSoFt: I thought a simple OS license could be bought, instead of the $169 box set.
15:40  KaOSoFt: ;_;
15:43  ae86-drifter: Kasm279|Away, yes, some do have firewire passthru & definately usb, i can guarentee u
15:43  Kasm279|Away: yes ae86-drifter to install
15:44  Kasm279|Away: and no, no firewire passthrough on apple monitors
15:44  ae86-drifter: yes
15:44  ae86-drifter: you are wrong
15:44  ae86-drifter: not on CURRENT models
15:44  Kasm279|Away: only thing that apples monitors passed through was ADB, sound, and USB
15:44  Kasm279|Away: depending on the mode
15:44  Kasm279|Away: model*
15:44  ae86-drifter: & FW
15:44  Kasm279|Away: which monitor has firewire then?
15:45  Cam: len(users.["##windows"]) > len(users.["##mac"])
15:45  Cam: :D
15:45  ae86-drifter: i think its a 20" sliverish one from about 4-5 yrs ago
15:45  Kasm279|Away: 20" silverish one...
15:45  ae86-drifter: we have 6 of them
15:45 * Kasm279|Away fires up mactracker
15:45  ae86-drifter: ill find it !! just wait
15:46  Kasm279|Away: the 20" DVI one?
15:46  Kasm279|Away: ok
15:46  Kasm279|Away: i appoligize
15:46  ae86-drifter: one of these: http://www.applematters.com/images/gallery/thisday/family20050610_medium.jpg
15:46  Kasm279|Away: it has firewire connectors on it
15:46  Kasm279|Away: i did not know this o.o
15:46  ae86-drifter: haha
15:47  Kasm279|Away: seems theat all of the DVI models do
15:47  ae86-drifter: since display port is used they removed them i think
15:48  Kasm279|Away: no
15:48  Kasm279|Away: because the only one that doesn't uses the displayport
15:48  Cam: Kasm279|Away, check PM
15:49  ae86-drifter: the new 24 LED display we just got only had usb, DP, and a nice little charger for the macbook :)
15:52  ae86-drifter: are they gonna make an iMac bigger than 27"?
