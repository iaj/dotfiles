02:06  pgpkeys: recommendations for ISO burning software on the Mac please
02:06  LordDragon: pgpkeys, disk utility
02:06  pgpkeys: part of osx?
02:06  LordDragon: yes
02:07  pgpkeys: location? 
02:07 @ChrisAM: pgpkeys ... I use hdiutil from the terminal.
02:07  LordDragon: applications->utilities->disk utility
02:07  pgpkeys: also part of the os chris?
02:07  pgpkeys: that like cdrdao or cdrecord?
02:07  pgpkeys: lorddragon: thanks. checking
02:07 @ChrisAM: yep
02:08 @ChrisAM: hdiutil burn -noverifyburn /path/to/your/file.iso
02:08 @ChrisAM: hdiutil convert also has some nice functionality.
02:08  pgpkeys: can i create an ISO with hidutil as well? (feed it a pre-prepared ir for the disk)?
02:08  pgpkeys: s/ir/dir/
02:09 @ChrisAM: you can make a dmg and then use hdiutil to convert it to an iso
02:09  pgpkeys: ok going to have to google on how to make a dmg then
02:10  pgpkeys: wow so much new stuff to learn switching from a PC to a mac even if i *was* using linux on the pc hehe
02:10 @ChrisAM: you can use Disk Utility to make a dmg
02:10  pgpkeys: thanks for not laughing :)
02:10  pgpkeys: oh? awesome
02:10  pgpkeys: ok, i'm getting a bit nervous, for some reason my CPU temp keeps jumping up to like 86C 
02:10  pgpkeys: but normally sits at around 55C
02:12  pgpkeys: ahhh thanks lorddragon i see whats up now
02:13  pgpkeys: and chrisam i'll check out that hdiutil
02:13  LordDragon: pgpkeys, 86C? what kind of mac?
02:13  pgpkeys: chrisam: both of these will make imges readable on PCs as well? (Trying to make a couple images of my mom's data that I have backed up on my NTFS based external USB drive)
02:14  pgpkeys: 13" macbook. model A1181
02:14  pgpkeys: currently fans are at 6192RPMs with a temp of 71C
02:14 @ChrisAM: pgpkeys ... are images the right way to go? Why not just put it in zip files or burn it directly to a CD?
02:14  pgpkeys: it just all of a sudden starts jacking up from like 52-55C to like 80-90C
02:15  pgpkeys: chrisam: well I was looking for something to burn ISOs I alraedy have AND be able to *make* ISO images as well
02:15  torchie: that
02:15  torchie: is a lot of C
02:15  pgpkeys: so i can back up the image on my usb drive for her
02:15  pgpkeys: torchie: yeah but it drops right back down after 2 or 3 minutes. fans slowly spin up, cools it off then it drops like its doing this very second
02:16  pgpkeys: I'm back down to 53C at 4700RPMs
02:16  pgpkeys: its just 90C is rather high on a *PC*, i don't know if thats normal for a macbook.
02:16  pgpkeys: cools off fast though
02:17  pgpkeys: (I feel likea damn 6yo trying to learn to drive the family car at times with this macbook sheesh)

14:50  pgpkeys: not bad! canadaram.com - can get 4GB mem kit, replacement battery, and 500GB hybrid seagate ssd/sata3 drive for this 13" macbook for $407 CDN (another $35 for Xpresspost deliver)
14:52  crilly: pgpkeys, nice :)
14:53  crilly: pgpkeys, what's the model number of the hybrid drive?
14:53  pgpkeys: yeah found that by doing a bit of digging
14:53  pgpkeys: sec
14:53  crilly: I paid £103 for 8GB of DDR3 for my MBP 13".
14:53  js_: i paid even less
14:53  pgpkeys: remember i just have a regular ol A1181 13" macbook
14:54  crilly: That's 163 CDN
14:54  crilly: pgpkeys, oh
14:54  crilly: you'll see a big increase in speed though
14:56  pgpkeys: 500GB Seagate 500 GB MOMENTUS XT 7200.1 Hybrid drive 4 GB SSD, 32MB CACHE. Our take: Excellent laptop drive that excels over drives other in its class. In tests, at worse this drive did better then its 7200rpm brothers and at best it outperformed the WD 10,000rpm Velociraptor. 2.5 7200RPM 32 MB Cache SATA Internal ST95005620AS
14:56  pgpkeys: http://www.canadaram.com/drives.htm#note25sata
14:59  crilly: £90 in the UK. Not bad that actually. So it has 4GB of SSD built in? How does that work? Is the SSD part facing the front bus or something?
15:00  pgpkeys: dont know. i'd have to call
15:03  crilly: I think the SSD is the first part of the storage that is hit.
15:03  crilly: it's used as a cache I think
15:06  pgpkeys: well it says it has a 32MB cache as well
15:07  pgpkeys: so wondering what that 4GB ssd is for. though it would make sense for speed to have it go.. cable, 4GB SSD, 32MB cache, main platter
15:07  pgpkeys: s
15:07  crilly: I'd be concerned with these points, pgpkeys: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive#Claimed_drawbacks
15:07  crilly: pgpkeys, the 4GB of SSD is used to cache data is that accessed the most.
15:07  pgpkeys: hehe well the fact that the url states 'claimed' i'd be worried if they were true
15:08  crilly: That's true.
15:08  pgpkeys: Lower performance (access time) for non-cached data
15:08  pgpkeys: If the data being accessed is not in the cache and the drive has spun down, access time will be greatly increased since the platters will need to spin-up. This is however not the case with the Seagate Momentus XT.
15:08  pgpkeys: which is the specific drive we're talking about

17:02  AnthonyCat: my macbooks wifi keeps getting slower and slower. It started a 0.8ms ping, then has slowly built up to 40,000 ms. Does anybody know why it would do this? My iPod's wifi seems to be working fine.
17:03  doguba: Question: Can i code ruby on rails from any location using someone else's computer and my code residing on a usb drive or does it have to reside on the computer... i am using a mac., Can i still use git to push the work to github and subsequently to my heroku app.. ?

17:14  AnthonyCat: doguba: 3
17:15  AnthonyCat: doguba: and it's wpa2  personal so yes
17:15  AnthonyCat: it also seems to run better when the charger isn't plugged in
17:17  doguba: AnthonyCat: have you tried running Network Utilities
17:18  AnthonyCat: I've looked at the info, but I've been pinging my airport router
17:19  AnthonyCat: And these are my airport utility stats: Signal: -85, Noise: -93, rate: 78, type 802.11b/g/n. Is that alright?

17:24  fujisan: dunno AnthonyCat 
17:25  fujisan: i was digesting some bananas the tryptophan released some serotonin making me smile in emots :o
17:26  bsdbandit: good morning all 
17:27  AnthonyCat_: bsdbandit: hi :)
17:27  bsdbandit: :)
17:27  bsdbandit: im in thinking mode this morning im using mac ports to install vlc instead of downloading it from the net 
17:28  bsdbandit: it looks like vlc has more updated version of vlc than the website 
17:28  bsdbandit: that is weird 
17:29  crilly: Why are you compiling something that has an OS X binary pre-compiled for you?
17:29  bsdbandit: bleeding edge 
17:29  bsdbandit: thats all 
17:29  bsdbandit: i love compiling 
17:29  bsdbandit: from mac ports 
17:29  bsdbandit: hacking unix/linx is my thing
17:30 --- AnthonyCat_ is now known as AnthonyCat
17:30  bsdbandit: since mac is freebsd 
17:30  bsdbandit: hey why not
17:32  crilly: I don't know. I just don't think OS X is designed for that simply because it has the ability to compile stuff.
17:33  bsdbandit:  yeah its another unix 
17:33  bsdbandit: under the hood thats all 
17:35  crilly: bsdbandit, each to their own. I moved to OS X to get away from that, but it's useful at times; it's equally nice to know it's there.
17:36  doguba: AnythonyCat: not sure
17:37  AnthonyCat: doguba: it seems to have settled down a bit now. Thanks for the help
17:37  bsdbandit: yes thats true 
17:37  bsdbandit: im a bsd head all day 
17:38  bsdbandit: nothing against linux but i think that the bsd are great as well 
17:38  crilly: I like Linux. I just got a job as a Linux sys admin lol
17:38  bsdbandit: lol 
17:38  bsdbandit: cool man

17:43  bsdbandit: this morning im configuring the solaris 10 firewall ive need to brush up on this for a long time 
17:43  bsdbandit: yeah i just want to be a great unix hacker i also code in python as well

19:58  linuxfreaker: Need some clarifications on Mac OS X version
19:58 --- Angostura_ is now known as Angostura
19:59  linuxfreaker: How is Darwin version different from Mac OS X version?
19:59  linuxfreaker: When I type : uname -r it shows different result other than when I type uname -v
20:00  linuxfreaker: whats the difference?
20:02  LordDragon: the mac osx version is the version of the whole OS. darwin version is just the bsd subsystem, not the complete OS
20:03  linuxfreaker: LordDragon: Thanks for quick response
20:04  LordDragon: kind of like how u get ubuntu 10.10 as the complete OS and 2.6.35-23 as the kernel version
20:04  linuxfreaker: What about uname -v?
20:04  linuxfreaker: Is it Build Number
20:04  LordDragon: its the kernel version
20:05  linuxfreaker: I generally see the Build Number starting with H..whats that?
20:05  linuxfreaker: What sequence it follow?
20:05  LordDragon: dunno
20:08  MrUnagi: Am I in the Ubuntu channel again?

20:21  ajeet_: Hello
20:22  ajeet_: I need some clarifications about Mac OS X  versions
20:22  ajeet_: 10.6.5 released with 10H574 and a week after got updated to 10H575? whats the difference?
20:23  ajeet_: Does it effect change in kernel?
20:24  ajeet_: I can see that it contains 10.5.0   as Darwins version
20:25  Velociraptors: might do. what are the build dates of each?
20:26 @ChrisAM: that's the build number
20:26 @ChrisAM: I would imagine there's a change in kernel, but I don't know of such a detailed changelog
20:27  ajeet_: What I really want to understand is how to categories the Mac OS X 10.6.5 and kernel version?
20:27  ajeet_: All I understand now is just marking Mac OS X with version information as 10.6.5 , 10.6.6 etc
20:28  ajeet_: But since you guy say it may differ in kernel version in each build ..Do I need to classify the Mac OS X version with kernel or build number too?
20:29  ajeet_: What would be the best way around?
20:29 @ChrisAM: what is your end goal?
20:30  ajeet_: I generally test upcoming Mac OS X
20:31  ajeet_: As for now my client shows the OS as Mac OS X 10.6.5, Mac OS X 10.6.6
20:31  LordDragon: ajeet_, no one really goes by kernel version of anything like that. mac users classify the OS based on the osx version number. like 10.5.8 or 10.6.5 etc
20:32  ajeet_: Now since  new builds are coming month after month..
20:32  ajeet_: with dfferent kernel version..
20:32  LordDragon: ajeet_, if you officially in some sort of osx testing programming, wouldnt you already know how to classify them?
20:33 @ChrisAM: post a question to the ADC forums.
20:34  ajeet_: What I see is Apple releases Darwin 10.4.0 for Mac OS X 10.6.4
20:34  ajeet_: 10.6 equivalent for 10
20:34  ajeet_: 10.6.4 equivalent for 10.4
20:35  ajeet_: [10.6].5 equivalent to 10.5.0 kernel
20:35  LordDragon: you said you are testing upcoming osx. osx is NOT darwin. darwin is strictly the unix sub system
20:35  ajeet_: is it correct?
20:35 @ChrisAM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29#Release_history
20:37  shuaib: So where does "Software Update" download the udates to on the system? Can I keep them for manual installation later (may be after a new system install?)
20:37  ajeet_: ChrisAM : I have already visited the link
20:38  RenegadeWut: If Darwin was so good at evolution, then why is he dead?
20:40  ajeet_: LordDragon: I can see options like Other Linux in some virtualization product of VirtualBox and Citrix which says Other Linux(2.6.x) displayed for Kernel family
20:40  S_SubZero: RenegadeWut: Notice Darwin has been dead for a long time, but you still know who he is.  
20:41  S_SubZero: evolution of thought
20:41  ajeet_: LordDragon: Similar way if different kernel is coming to market then saying it as Mac OS X 10.6.5 or 10.6.6 makes it difficult 
20:43  ajeet_: I can see options like Other Linux in some virtualization product of VirtualBox and Citrix which says Other Linux(2.6.x) displayed for Kernel famil
20:43  ajeet_: Can we have similar option put for Darwin too
20:43  LordDragon: ajeet_, this is mac osx. not linux
20:44  Angostura: ajeet_: And Darwin is not OS X
20:45  ajeet_: As I am from Linux background, can Anyone elaborate why can't?
20:45  Angostura: "Why can't" what?
20:45  S_SubZero: The typical OS X user has no idea about kernels or Darwin or any of that.  The OS is designed for soccer moms.
20:45  bsdbandit: wow 
20:45  bsdbandit: good point 
20:45  bsdbandit: ;lol 
20:45  bsdbandit: lol 
20:46  bsdbandit: but you can do alot from behind the scenes on a mac 
20:46  S_SubZero: you *can* but it's not something Apple is really pushing.  At all.
20:46  ajeet_: S_SubZero_;  no idea about kernel???what it means?
20:46  bsdbandit: true
20:46  S_SubZero: ajeet_: OS X users aren't nerds.
20:46  bsdbandit: lol 
20:47  Angostura: ajeet_: What kernel does your washing machine run?
20:47  bsdbandit: wow 
20:47  Swian: my wife is on a mac an has no clue what a kernel is
20:47  LordDragon: lolz
20:47  Swian: and she doesn't need to, she just needs her machine to work
20:47  bsdbandit: that true the only reason i have a mac is b/c of its bsd stuff under the hood
20:48  Swian: that's your reason, but not everyones
20:48  bsdbandit: yeah true 
20:48  bsdbandit: b/c everyone is not a nerd 
20:48  Swian: I have macs because I like the OS and the hardware is reliable
20:48  bsdbandit: or hacker for that matter 
20:48  Angostura:  Whereas I know quite a lot about kernels, but certainly doesn't care about day to day using OS X. Neither should I
20:48  bsdbandit: yes it is you are right about that Swian 
20:48  Swian: then again I also run linux and windows
20:49  LordDragon: there are a small group of ppl that want macs to tinker within the terminal and mess with bsd, but 99% of mac users just want a stable safe easy to use and sexy looking computer to use 
20:49  bsdbandit: :)
20:49  bsdbandit: you are right 
20:49  Angostura: Originally I switched because I liked geeking about with the Unix internals but I didn't have to. I also just wanted to run iMovie and Word
20:49  Swian: I don't think I've ever thought of a computer as sexy
20:49  bsdbandit: lol 
20:49  ajeet_: What I saw  is CLient which have different kernel ..is it true?
20:50  Angostura: ajeet_: Your questions make no sense
20:50  Angostura: Try to express yourself more clearly
20:50  bsdbandit: ajeet_ what are you trying to do man 
20:50  bsdbandit: ?
20:50  LordDragon: ajeet_, your broken english is making it hard for us to understand what you are asking us
20:50  S_SubZero: do the needful
20:50  Angostura: for great justice
20:51  bsdbandit: im so ready to lion to come out 
20:51  LordDragon: not me
20:52  ajeet_: I will try to understand what I really needed 
20:52  LordDragon: a full desktop OS is important to me. things like windowed apps and scrollbars are critically important
20:53  S_SubZero: ajeet_: You're missing the forest for the trees
20:53  S_SubZero: absolutely no way you will get that
20:54  Swian: what kinda trees oaks or maple?
20:54  S_SubZero: A typical Mac user changes their background and makes the dock a different size.  That's their limit on tweaking.
20:57  bsdbandit: true
20:57  ajeet_: We Have a testing environment in our place which is working on Virtualization Client software.Now we start testing with Mac OS X 10.6.5 which released with 10H574 Build and  a week after updated to 10H575.If we are given only 10.6.5 with kernel 10.5.0 we may be testing a different version.So I want to understand if its really needed to have specifically 10.6.5 quoted as 10H575) or 10.5.0(10H575)
20:57  ajeet_: Does it seems relevant?
20:57  S_SubZero: if you are into this sort of thing legitimately, you aren't here asking US about it.  You have official resources for those kinds of questions
20:58  LordDragon: exactly
20:58  Angostura: bsdbandit: Lion looks like a snoozefest to me. Might be handy for my parents tho
20:58  bsdbandit: oh ok 
20:58  bsdbandit: do they have the development versio out yet 
20:58  bsdbandit: ?
20:58  bsdbandit: version 
20:58  Angostura: Not as far as I know
20:58  bsdbandit: oh ok 
20:59  bsdbandit: i would like to install the  beta 
21:00  ajeet_: S_SubZero:I need your suggestion? what u say?
21:00  ajeet_: S_SubZero: May it be new to me? But the answer help me understanding more about Darwin releases
21:01  S_SubZero: ajeet_: CALL.  APPLE.
21:02  bsdbandit: lol 
21:02  S_SubZero: कंपनी को बुलाओ.
21:02  S_SubZero: thanks translate.google.com
21:03  Velociraptors: ajeet_:  You'd get much better information if you contacted apple, or used their developer resources instead of asking here - this channel *is* quite a knowledgeable group, but the info you're after goes beyond what most folk here know or care about. 
21:03  Velociraptors: ajeet_:  not that people don't want to help, but the answers you're after just aren't here. 
21:03  ajeet_: thanks anyway..
21:03  LordDragon: Velociraptors, his complete lack of knowledge related to testing and is unwillingness to use proper channels make it seem a bit suspicious
21:04  ajeet_: Seems like I need to go through  wiki link sent earlier
21:04  ajeet_: thnx anyway
21:04  LordDragon: lol
21:04  Velociraptors: ajeet_:  contact Apple. 
21:04  ajeet_: Sure
21:04  LordDragon: see? he completely ignores us when we tell him to use the proper channels
21:05  S_SubZero: LordDragon: People dont just find OS X builds laying around? 
21:05  ajeet_: thanks Veloci

21:18  Velociraptors: occasionally a huge loop of cold from antarctica comes up over Australia - the kind that'll take a 44C summer day down to 16C. This one's quite early, and quite huge
21:19  crilly: ah
21:19  Velociraptors: usually it only happens twice a summer around here, and we've already had it twice - it snowed in mid october!
21:19  crilly: i bet it gets cold at night anyway?
21:19  crilly: We have the snow here now
21:19  Velociraptors: this time of the year, 16-18C at night, usually
21:19  crilly: bloody annoying, but beautiful. 
21:19  Velociraptors: and 30-32C days
21:20  Velociraptors: yeah, it's pretty :D
21:20 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 100 seconds
21:26  tonsofpcs: Anyone know of a video chat that I can easily permit-only through a firewall?  Something SIP-based maybe that I can port lock?  I have a machine that I want to remain isolated except for internet video chat.

21:36  Angostura: tonsofpcs: Skype?
21:37  Angostura: crilly: Hmmm, I don't really like thick gravy. For me just the meat juices are best
21:37 @crilly: Angostura, ah :)
21:38  Angostura: Pop a bit of water in the roasting pan and heat until all the cooked juices disolve. Separate the fat off. Lovely
21:38  Angostura: Mine was leg of lamb with roast potatoes, parsnips, sprouts
21:42  txxt: do u know any mail server for mac with an esy to use GUI ? thanks in advance
21:44  sgfgdf: hello guys! is there a way to count working hours per week, month or some interval using just iCal?
21:44 @crilly: txxt, mail server? you mean client? Mail is good. Thunderbird too. There are commercial options like PostBox too.
21:45  txxt: mail :P
21:45  txxt: like dovecot ;) 
21:45  txxt: i do love Thunderbird and Postbox and use them a lot. but i do need to have a local mail server in macbook 
21:45  tonsofpcs: Angostura: skype isn't easy to filter/find with a firewall
21:46  tonsofpcs: I was thinking iChat might be capable of this... I'm not sure how iChat negotiates connections, however
21:46  Angostura: Are you connecting Mac-to-Mac?
21:47  tonsofpcs: Angostura: yes
21:47  txxt: do you know any crilly ? ;)
21:47  tonsofpcs: mind you, I don't have a mac on the internet to play with to test it :)
21:47 @crilly: txxt, mail server? No. Well I know of them, but they're not simple to setup mate.
21:48  tonsofpcs: txxt: you can probably run postfix... mail servers generally don't have GUIs though (or any UI for that matter)
21:49  txxt: crilly and tonsofpcs do you run any mail server in your machines ? dovecot, postfix ? i know that GUIs are no that common, but would be handy ;)
21:49 @crilly: tonsofpcs, iChat and Sypke, or any application, will use upnp to punch a hole in your firewall and router to allow a connection.
21:49  tonsofpcs: txxt: I don't have a mac.
21:49  txxt: ;)
21:50  txxt: os x server for instance has a nice gui to setup and manage dovecot for instance.
21:50  tonsofpcs: crilly: the thing is, I don't want this machine to be able to do anything online but the video chat.  Skype needs http access in order to work
21:51  tonsofpcs: crilly: I was thinking maybe some sort of SIP video client that I can fix-assign its communication ports as well
21:52  tonsofpcs: that way I can also just make a hosts entry and not even need DNS to have the connection work.
21:52 @crilly: Well only sets up and tears down the communication, you have to think about the protocol being used to transport the media too.
21:52 @crilly: Well SIP*
21:52  tonsofpcs: right.  for instance skype's transport is apparently quite easy to find, the issue I have with it is the setup requires http.
21:53 @crilly: Yes.
21:53  atmosx: tonsofpcs: why does skype need video chat?
21:53  atmosx: and secondly can't you use little snitch to determin per application firewall layer?
21:53 @crilly: Yes you can.
21:53  atmosx: err tonsofpcs I mean why skype needs http
21:54  tonsofpcs: atmosx: it uses http and https for login and buddy list transfers, apparently
21:54 @crilly: Yeah it does.
21:54  atmosx: I see
21:54  tonsofpcs: well, if I can have the SIP client on my 'secure' machine only set up connections to a specific port, I can default block all, enable SIP call out to a prespecified IP address (proxy), and allow that port only (and no others) for SIP connections, I'd be fine.  
21:54  atmosx: hmm littlesnitch + ipf and you're all set
21:54 @crilly: tonsofpcs, most SIP based services use STUN, TURN and ICE to get a connectioh to the other host.
21:54  atmosx: err ipfw 
21:54  atmosx: tonsofpcs: you can use a proxy
21:54  atmosx: for the http requests
21:55  atmosx: a proxy with login/pass that will have only skype enabled
21:55  atmosx: if you don't want to use littlesnitch
21:55  tonsofpcs: atmosx: the machine can't be running firewall software (or any additional software, really)
21:55  atmosx: tonsofpcs: is it a mac?
21:55  tonsofpcs: atmosx: yes
21:55  atmosx: tonsofpcs: and you can't install littlesnitch or any other software on it?
21:55  tonsofpcs: crilly: right, I'd need to use some sort of SIP redirector/proxy/'host' service like iptel does for VoIP
21:56  tonsofpcs: atmosx: I _can_ install whatever I want on it, I won't.
21:56  atmosx: tonsofpcs: uhm. I don't get it, but probably you know already what to do heh
21:56  tonsofpcs: atmosx: it is in a secure environment and needs to remain that way the firewall has to be outside of and independent of the machine
21:56 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
21:56  tonsofpcs: :s/way/way;/
21:57  atmosx: well... what does that have to do with littlesnitch?
21:58  tonsofpcs: atmosx: littlesnitch affects how the machine runs and I need to maintain its performance
21:58  atmosx: hmm
21:58  tonsofpcs: this solution also haas to not be able to be overriden by users (who have root access on the mac)
21:59  atmosx: do you have root access to the firewall machine?
21:59  tonsofpcs: the firewall will be either a checkpoint edge device or a routerOS device and can be configured as needed.
22:00  tonsofpcs: so anyway, crilly, know of any good SIP Video+VoIP apps?
22:00  tonsofpcs: (that can be locked to a specific port)
22:01 @crilly: Nope, I don't sorry.
22:02 @crilly: I can only think you use Skype/iChat and do something with the routing table locally, or setup a VPN/IPsec tunnel between the host and your ntwork.
22:02  tonsofpcs: well, how does iChat establish connections?
22:03  tonsofpcs: i see tthat it "works with AIM", but is AIM required? is there another option?
