00:16  diffract|: hello
00:16  diffract|: does anyone know a font where the characters are equally spaced?
00:17 @crilly: isn't that a monospaced font?
00:18  S_SubZero: lucida sans typewriter?
00:18 +Tomis: yea, a monospaced font
00:18 +Tomis: look in Font Book.app > Fixed Width
00:18  S_SubZero: Andale Mono?
00:22  diffract|: ok, thanks
00:22  diffract|: i'll used monospaced
00:22  diffract|: i'll use*
00:24 @crilly: diffract|: As Tomis said, it might also be referred to as a "Fixed Width" font.
00:24  diffract|: why doesn't inkscape read system fonts?
00:24 @crilly: It should do.
00:25 +Tomis: because it's open source fail?
00:25 @crilly: Programming issue, I'd say.
00:25  diffract|: i don't see monaco or andale
00:25 +Tomis: isn't it an X11 app?
00:25  diffract|: yes it is
00:25 +Tomis: there you go
00:25  diffract|: i'm used to it and i don't see a free alternative
00:27 @crilly: Get the job done probably and pay for professional software - you've already bought the professioanl hardware.
00:28  diffract|: i don't want to pay for software and use less than 10% of it
00:28  diffract|: i only know adobe illustrator and it is huge and expensive
00:29 @crilly: Then you're stuck with OSS "solutions" which have been half-arsed implemented and half-arse ported to a professional environment.
00:29 @crilly: You can get massive discounts if you're a student or it's strictly for personal use.
00:29  diffract|: yes that seems so
00:29 @crilly: You can also get older versions off eBay.
00:29 @crilly: Don't need CS9,999
00:29 @crilly: CS2/3 will do.
00:31 @crilly: diffract|: http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Adobe-ILLUSTRATOR-10-CAN-UPGRADED-CS-CS2-CS3-/260691697464?pt=UK_Computing_Software_Software_SR&hash=item3cb26f9f38
00:31 @crilly: Then price a CS2/3/4 upgrade.
00:32  derp: a brand new macbook pro is 32 or 64 bits?
00:32 @crilly: The CPU supports 64 bit. The Darwin kernel is 32bit.
00:32  diffract|: derp: usually 64, but read the specs
00:33  diffract|: crilly: well, i like inkscape.. i don't think not being able to use a certain font is enough reason to switch programs
00:33  derp: thanks
00:34 @crilly: I agree.
00:34  diffract|: i find it very capable for an OSS
00:35 @crilly: I'm sure it's brilliant, but again, you have bought professional hardware.
00:37  diffract|: oh well, thanks for the support.. i'll see what i can do
00:39 @crilly: diffract|: Maybe it doesn't support user installed fonts? Can it see the other fonts you have installed?
00:39 @crilly: For example, fonts you install are in ~/Library/Fonts
00:39 @crilly: But the system fonts are in /System/Fonts I think
00:40  diffract|: crilly: i don't remember installing any fonts explicitly myself.. i see lots of fonts(over 40), but not the ones i'm interested in
00:40  diffract|: in inkscape
00:41 @crilly: Oh I see
00:41 @crilly: Might be the type of font then, but that would be wierd.
00:42  diffract|: yup.. my ~/Library/Fonts is empty
00:42 @crilly: :/
00:42  diffract|: it might be related to X11
00:42  diffract|: it doesn't import everything or something like that
00:43  diffract|: i read somewhere that X11 on the mac is old now
00:43  diffract|: hasn't been updated in a while
00:43 @crilly: It has been replaced I believe.
00:44  diffract|: i was thinking of coding inkscape so it runs without X11 myself, but i know nothing about cocoa yet
00:45  bavarious: the last release of X11.app was on Aug 13th
00:45  diffract|: anyway.. it's still just a small nuiance.. i'll just use a different font
00:48  incluye: What is the -10 error on launchctl load?
00:48 @crilly: look it up
00:49  incluye: I did
00:49  incluye: sudo -> dubious permissions on file
00:52  incluye: That's the only place google says the -10 error is found
00:53 @crilly: hmm wierd
00:53 @crilly: have you checked the permissions?

01:33  MariusAZP: Hi
01:35  klepton: i have a w7 partition om my mbp and i'm wondering how to change to it, need to use sindows for a while, i know how to go from w7 to osx but not the opposite
01:36  MariusAZP: Just hold in opt key when you hear the bong noise when you start your computer
01:36  MariusAZP: It'll pull up a boot selector
01:36  thelostpatrol: restart the computer, and hold OPTION from when you hear the chime until you see two icons appear on your screen
01:37  thelostpatrol: when finished, restart again to get back to mac os
01:37  thelostpatrol: but you know that already
01:37  MariusAZP: It would be really cool if macs could load up both, and you could swap back and forth 
01:38  MariusAZP: I wonder how hard that would be to do in hardware
01:38  thelostpatrol: well it can already be done in VM so i suppose it wouldn't take too much extra power
01:38  MariusAZP: Fast OS switching
01:38  MariusAZP: Yeah but native hardware swapping would be sweet
01:39  thelostpatrol: but it's a feature that i doubt many consumers would be interested in. they have a hard enough time just using one operating system most of the time.
01:39  MariusAZP: Anyone that plays games on a mac would like it
01:41  thelostpatrol: i'd rather apple just make better driers tbh
01:41  MariusAZP: Implemented as a hardware feature to be OS independent, I'm patenting that shit
01:41  thelostpatrol: drivers*
01:41  MariusAZP: Drivers for what?
01:42  thelostpatrol: video
01:42 +Branes: IBM already have that one covered, marius
01:42  thelostpatrol: so that my steam games work better :P
01:42  MariusAZP: There's still no native directx layer
01:42 +Branes: never will be. thank fsck
01:43  MariusAZP: If Apple would just let Nvidia and ATI write their own drivers it wouldn't be a problem
01:44  MariusAZP: It's just a software layer, wouldn't be too bad
01:44  MariusAZP: As long as it only loaded when you needed it
01:45  MariusAZP: I've got friends at MS that say it's already been done, they'll never release it though
01:47  thelostpatrol: man it is really annoying using the internet in non-english speaking countries if you're english native
01:48  thelostpatrol: every site redirects to some jibberish i don't want to see
01:48  thelostpatrol: argh
01:48  MariusAZP: I guess companies need to figure out how to make good games again before anything like that ever happens

03:51 +Tomis: get external speakers kevin
03:52 +Tomis: you may be able to push is a little further using absurd EQ settings and setting the volume above 100% in some apps
03:52  synaesthetik: VLC can amplifiy up to 200%
03:52 +Tomis: but you're going to end up with blown-out and clipped audio pretty quick doing that
03:54  [Kevin]: I just want to hear my music from across the room
03:54 +Tomis: get better speakers
03:54  [Kevin]: I have no money
03:54  [Kevin]: I'll just put up with it until I've saved enough for a new laptop
03:54 +Tomis: anoher macbook?
03:54  [Kevin]: no
03:55  synaesthetik: open your music files in VLC and you can play it twice as loud
03:55 +Tomis: the macbook pro speakers are much better than whats in the macbook
03:55 +Tomis: but *all* laptop speakers are craptastic
03:55 +Tomis: just plug in to some decent externals
03:55  [Kevin]: vlc goes to 400% actually
03:56  synaesthetik: even better
03:57 @ChrisAM: Louder means more distorted on those tiny macbook speakers
03:57 +Tomis: yup

09:33 +Branes: user81: install an SMB stack.
09:33  user81: from the OS X cd's?
09:34 +Branes: No, onto your linuxes - OSX uses OpenSMB so it should detect and work with any normal SMB share
09:35 +Branes: Oh, just re-read what you said.
09:36  user81: the setup is like this: server cluster is running openldap, kerberos, samba 3.x (old-style pdc), nfs4. Windows clients log on as NT style domain clients, Linux boxes use kerberos and nfs4. The objective is to get "login anywhere, on any client"
09:36 +Branes: The Macs should pick up any SMB sharespace and work with AD/OD
09:36 +Branes: Ah. Can't do that with Macs.
09:36  user81: They don't get the SMB part, only Apple Open directory, Active directory (samba 4 - not ready yet), or Openldap
09:36 +Branes: Unless the server they talk to is OSX Server
09:37  user81: Well it does support Ldap, so all that would need to be added is a ldap schema and a way to mount nfs shares as the home directory
09:37 +Branes: No can do.
09:37  user81: Or i could setup an experimental samba 4 server
09:37 +Branes: OSX won't allow it; it does things its own way.
09:38  user81: Is that the reason why SMB support has been removed from leopard, and up?
09:38  user81: I'm sure it was there in Tiger
09:38 +Branes: SMB support was never removed, it has been resent since late 10.2
09:38 +Branes: *present
09:38  Psixerces: Go > Connect to Server > smb://servername/sharename
09:39 +Branes: You just can't put the home directory anywhere except on the local machine, unless they are talking to an OSX Server
09:39  user81: That really blows.
09:39  Psixerces: as for kerberos - you can link to another kerberos domain via an OS X Server.
09:39  user81: OS X server is just not an option
09:39  Psixerces: look at the magic triangle
09:39 +Branes: "login anywhere, on any client" *only* works if all clients and the server are OSX.
09:39  user81: Not for a few clients
09:40  Psixerces: I use OS X Server for 3 clients - all of which are my own computers
09:40  user81: The network runs a national CRM, ERP etc etc. Most clients are either Windows or Linux.
09:40  Psixerces: but then Branes would say I am abnormal - I  use terminal :p
09:40  Psixerces: user81 - if its that big, they can afford to pick up a mac mini server.
09:40 * Branes seconds that
09:41  Psixerces: it makes managing mac clients so much easier - and when you throw in netboot and deploystudio - deployment too
09:41  user81: Is there really no way to make Ldap etc "ACT like open directory?
09:41 +Branes: Not on OSX
09:41  Psixerces: you would need to be altering the LDAP Schema.
09:41  user81: true, but this company is trying to do everything open source - there's no way they're spending anymore on Microsoft or Apple.
09:41 +Branes: Then sell the Macs.
09:42  user81: Indeed
09:42  user81: Well thanks for the help anyway. I'll see if i can hack the LDAP schema's. If it works I'll do a post explaining how.
09:42 +Branes: The only safe way to integrate Macs into your networkflow is by adding OSX Server to the mix to act as server+gateway for the OSX client machines. And a Mini Server is pretty cheap, all things considered.
09:42 +Branes: That's not going to help
09:42  user81: That's true
09:43  Psixerces: its cheaper then getting a mini and server seperate.
09:43  user81: but it's a matter of principle
09:43 +Branes: If you mess with *any* file Apple installs as part of the OS, things implode, often catastrophically.
09:43  Psixerces: user81 - the hacks need to occur server side...
09:43  user81: Obviously it would be server-side as that is where the LDAP service is running
09:43  Psixerces: and I would advise against it, I never like altering the schema of any directory
09:44 +Branes: Apple and MacOS are *the* most draconian and ruthlessly non-standard company and OS on the planet.
09:44  user81: Absolutely. 
09:44  Psixerces: but sl server lets you take an AD/LDAP record and augment it once the kerberos is setup correctly
09:44  Psixerces: but if all you want is single sign on in many cases- just save the passwords in the keychain
09:44  user81: True, and there's still samba4 which implements AD.
09:45 +Branes: And as I said, Apple do things their own way, they will change standards to suit their OS more than Microsoft ever has.
09:45  Psixerces: I rarely enter a password for internet sites, or afp/smb shares at all
09:46  user81: The idea is that the company can log in from any phone, laptop, cubicle at one of the offices - all secured and encrypted. As far as Unix,linux and windows clients go, it's all setup. It's just the Apple iPad's and Mini's that are the problem.
09:46 +Branes: If you can't get it to work, and decide to not get a Mini Server for OSX, and then decide to do away with OSX clients, do *not* try and put linux onto the Apple hardware. Sell the machines and replace them with something standardised.
09:47 +Branes: iPads, eh? Mini Server is mandatory, then.
09:47  user81: But if Mac's support AD in its full capacity, then Samba 4 may be the solution.
09:47  Psixerces: not sure what version of samba os x runs, but its not the latest and greatest.
09:48 +Branes: You need a semi-closed OS to act as bridge between your open-OS network and the closed-OS iPads.
09:48  user81: one third has linux, one third has windows, and one third is insane about everything apple.
09:48  Psixerces: on the iPads use webdav.
09:48  Psixerces: on the macs - try go > connect to server > smb:// and see how you go
09:49  user81: The mac's can mount any share, that's never been the problem. But true SSO and roaming profiles-style environment is what i need.
09:49  Psixerces: not going to work.
09:49 +Branes: Mini Server. Only reliable solution for both iOS and MacOS
09:49 +Branes: And even then, it's not going to work 100%.
09:49  user81: why not?
09:49 +Branes: 90, maybe 95%.
09:49  user81: What wouldn't work?
09:50  Psixerces: roaming directories for one, they work on os x hardware
09:50  Psixerces: but when using AD it just mounts the home dir as a drive, and uses a local home dir
09:50 +Branes: User profiles won't work with iPads, iOS isn't geared for it.
09:50  user81: But what about the Active directory support in Mac OS, it doesn't support roaming profiles either?
09:50 +Branes: With the iPad, the machine *is* the profile.
09:50  Psixerces: you can specify a home dir that is afp - but then you will have issues with programs that expect hfs
09:51  Psixerces: sorry - smb
09:51  user81: What about using Netatalk? (AFP server for linux)
09:51 +Branes: Won't work.
09:51 +Branes: Not compliant enough,
09:51  Psixerces: that might work - but what happens when you get content thats similiar on two systems.
09:52  user81: Shouldn't the unique profiles cover that/
09:52  Psixerces: if they are unique - how do they roam?
09:52 +Branes: No, because netatalk doesn't support the metadata OSX uses.
09:52  Psixerces: the only way to get mac home directories roaming is via OS X Server.
09:52  Psixerces: or accept trade offs to use most apps on an SMB
09:52 +Branes: And forget roaming iPads.
09:53  Psixerces: iPads are 1:1, or shared single accounts
09:53  Psixerces: and you can manage them via exchange but never tried that.
09:53 +Branes: Treat iPads like large iPhones -- disturbingly personal, and once set up for a user, impossible to change user without reformatting the machine.
09:53  Psixerces: the scale I have worked on is always iPhone Config Util, not SCEP
09:54  user81: Hmm.. that's really annoying. So at every turn a non-open solution is required.
09:54 +Branes: With Apple? Yup.
09:54 +Branes: Thankfully it's the same solution, a Mini Server.
09:54 +Branes: Apple are the antithesis of open.
09:55 +Branes: iOS, doubly so.
09:56  user81: Like i said it's a matter of principle. Truly everything they have is open source; SSO, CRM, ERP, PBX, CCTV, Groupware the works. Windows is being phased out, and will be gone soon. There's no way any OS X server will be bought. The answer then clearly is: get rid of everything apple.
09:56 +Branes: If that's the principle, then that's the only option.
09:57  user81: Personally I agree with the principle. Free business tools all around.
09:57  Psixerces: in which case its an example of a philosophy/principal going to the extreme, rather then what many would see as an acceptable trade off.
09:57  Psixerces: for instance - what happens when someone wants to connect an iphone, droid or win mob 7?
09:58  user81: Not really, you wouldn't believe the vast sums that have been lost for them over the past 20 years in dealing with closed source development.
09:58  Psixerces: droid might work, but then your dealing with a vendors version of an app
09:58  user81: Droid or Mob 7 aren't a problem
09:58  Psixerces: Mob 7 doesn't even support 802.1x from what I have heard
09:59 +Branes: Nor .2d
09:59  user81: Samba 4 goes a long way, with most services.
09:59  user81: It's just not entirely ready yet....
10:00  user81: Anyway thanks guys, I've got a meeting to prepare ;-)
10:00  user81: I'll post back if I find any solution.

11:42  Foxdie: Hi all
11:42  Foxdie: Can someone please confirm for me if the new 15" Macbook Pro Core i7 is truly a quad core machine?
11:43  Foxdie: (ie. 4 processing cores, with hyperthreading, so 8 visible cores?)
11:43  Foxdie: Or is it still a dual core CPU with hyperthreading (4 visible cores)?
11:58  Foxdie: "You can upgrade the processor in your MacBook Pro to the 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 processor — the fastest dual-core processor available, featuring a 4MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.46GHz."
11:58  Foxdie: That's what it says on the Apple Store, I was under the impression all i7s were Quad Core
11:59  andrewfree_: its 2 cores
11:59  andrewfree_: 4 threads
11:59  andrewfree_: its kinda a trick the quad core i7s have 4 cores 8 threads.
11:59  andrewfree_: hyperthreading does that. Only processor before the i7 to have hyperthreading was the p4
12:04  Angostura: Branes: So Papermaster has defected to Cisco
12:15  Foxdie: Sorry andrewfree_, that confuses
12:15  Foxdie: Which one is it?
12:15  Foxdie: The MPB i7's are definitely Dual Core with hyperthreading?
12:16  andrewfree_: Foxdie: its the duel core one with hyperthreading

12:53  andrewfree_: its 2 cores 4 threads 
12:53  andrewfree_: why do you need to know for sure?
12:54  Foxdie: That is disappointing
12:54  Foxdie: I was seriously geared up for buying a true quad core macbook 
12:55  Foxdie: Now I'm thinking "What's the benefit of paying the extra for a Core i7 vs a Core i5 MBP?"
12:56  andrewfree_: its faster.. lol
12:56  Foxdie: Enough to justify the significant price increase?
12:56  andrewfree_: i dont think i5 has hyperthreading
12:57  andrewfree_: 3 memory chan vs 2
12:57  andrewfree_: that specific upgrade processor is from q3 of 2010 so brand new basicly
12:57  Foxdie: True but don't the Core i7 macs have 2 RAM slots?
12:57  Foxdie: Rendering the triple channel useless?
12:57  andrewfree_: no 3 memory chanels to the ram
12:57  Foxdie: (compared to 2 channels)
12:57  andrewfree_: touche... idk
12:58  andrewfree_: the i7 doesnt us a FSB either it uses intels thing to directly connect to the ram or something I forgot
12:59  andrewfree_: i say its worth getting the 2.66 ghz i7
12:59  andrewfree_: i wouldnt spend the money to update it to 2.8 but I would go with the i7 forsure
13:05  Paul_UK: hi all, i've just got a mac but no mac keyboard, its a windows one.  which key is the option key?
13:06  Foxdie: Plug it in and try CMD+TAB
13:07  Foxdie: First try WIN+TAB 
13:07  Foxdie: then CTRL+TAB
13:07  Foxdie: etc etc until you find it
13:07  Foxdie: You can always redefine the keys in System Preferences
13:07  Paul_UK: well i;ve got the keyboard viewer up and none of those combinations make the option key flag up
13:07  Paul_UK: ok and it will be fine when i want to choose which partition i can boot from?
13:08  Foxdie: I would think so (if you mean bootcamp)
13:08  Paul_UK: Foxdie, well it's to install snow leopard
13:09  Paul_UK: ok i've remapped it, will check whether it works, thanks foxdie for the quick reply :)

I have a script which includes this code:  "set fRef to (open for access ((POSIX path of (path to desktop) as string) & "NextActions.txt") with write permission)"   - i would like to save the file in the same folder the script is in, rather than on the desktop.  How do I change it to do that?

17:15 +Branes: http://www.apple.com/ <- okay, what is His Arrogance up to this time.
17:16  thresh: support for IDN, i hope!
17:16  torchie: what's the downside of arrogance
17:17  torchie: this itunes announcement better somehow be a new 13 inch macbook pro
17:17  hamiltop: with the dispay of the 13inch air
17:18  hamiltop: so, anyone good with water spills?  or does anyone know where I could find people good with water spills?
17:19 * Branes gets out his technician's hat
17:19  CEnTR4L: http://www.apple.com/
17:19 +Branes: hamiltop: First thing, DO NOT POWER IT ON. Don't even THINK of it.
17:19  CEnTR4L: Check the home page
17:19 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
17:19  hamiltop: Branes:  alright, so here's where I'm at.  Powered on... Didn't realize water had spilled....
17:19 +Branes: hamiltop: Next step - if possible remove the battery.
17:19 * Branes winces
17:19 +Branes: Chances of recovery just plummeted.
17:20  thresh: maybe he turned muslim
17:20  hamiltop: well here's where I'm currently at
17:20  hamiltop: the machine works.... I'm on it right now
17:20 +Branes: DON'T.
17:20  thresh: and he's going to celebrate Eid al-Adha
17:20  thresh: tomorrow
17:20 +Branes: Read what I tell you to do, and then shut down and follow instructions.
17:20  hamiltop: it's been 24 hours
17:20  hamiltop: (just supplying more information
17:21  hamiltop: and the only issue I'm currently facing is that the battery won't charge.
17:21  hamiltop: the kernel_task is workign at 85%, which im guessing is saying "WTF? what's wrong?"
17:21 +Branes: Get a large tub, and a 5 kg bag of rice, and a pair of stockings or pantiyhose. Remove the battery, close the laptop lid but wedge it upen an inch with a soft pencil reaser, then put it into a stocking. Tye shut.
17:22 +Branes: Pour half an inch of rice into the tub, put your en-stocking'd laptop into the tub, and then bury it in rice.
17:22 +Branes: Leave for an absolute minimum of 48 hours before attempting use.
17:22  thresh: then eat the rice.
17:22 +Branes: Yes, something is struggling. Probably conductive spikes underneath a chip.
17:23 +Branes: Shut down NOW. Go get the rice and the stocking, and spend the next couple days catching up on books or TV.
17:23  hamiltop: k... I've also read that cleaning the board with a q-tip and alcohol will clear out any shorts due to oxidation
17:23 +Branes: Yes, but first you need to get as much moisture out as possible. The rice is great for that, and its a cheap dessicant.
17:24  torchie: the crazy part is that he's serious
17:24  hamiltop: yeah, I know
17:24 +Branes: Very.
17:25  hamiltop: k.  Shutting down... I can't get the battery out because I'm in class.  but I'll get that out in the next hour or so.
17:25 +Branes: Go on, git. Off the machine before some moisture creeps in somewhere else by osmosis.
17:26 +Branes: Water on electronics, and he keeps using it. *facepalm*
17:26  bdelin88: I have photoshop and flash open right now and I noticed that my system is going a little slow... so I checked the activity monitor.  Why do I have 5GB of inactive RAM and only 15MB of remaining Free RAM?  Something I am missing here, why isn't it utilizing more RAM if it needs it?
17:27 +Branes: If you're in 32-bit mode for 10.6 (which is the default) the most any one application can use is 2 GB
17:29  torchie: man we need to make some electronics where it's just like
17:29  torchie: water
17:29  torchie: whatever
17:30  torchie: except all the time
17:30 +Branes: You want to pay $11,000 for a milspec-hardened Touchbook? Be my guest.
17:31  bdelin88: Branes: well PS is 64 and Flash is 32... but it still seems a little weird... there's not exactly a lot of stuff running
17:32  bdelin88: that's strange, I thought itunes would be 64bit...
17:32 +Branes: bdelin88: Unless you have specifically told OSX to book into 64-bit mode, you'll still encounter a 2GB-per-app limit, whether the app is 64-bit or otherwise.
17:32 +Branes: s/book/boot
17:33  bdelin88: Branes: there are no apps requiring 2GB or more (or even close) by themselves
17:34 * Branes shrugs
17:34 +Branes: Just relaying what I know that may be relevant to your situation :)
17:34  bdelin88: lol, well thank you
17:34  thresh: somehow osx wont boot in 64bit on my macbook 3,1
17:34  bdelin88: what I am saying is, it says my mac has 5 GB of RAM just sitting around inactive waiting to be used... and then it only says that I have 30MB free
17:34  torchie: well if we could just make everything milspec
17:34  torchie: done
17:35  thresh: kinda stupid not to support 64bit on fully capable 64bit hw
17:35  bdelin88: I am gonna take it in to the care center...grr
17:35  bdelin88: thresh: yea, especially when you make the entire laptop pretty much, and the os JUST FOR THAT HW
17:35  thresh: indeed
17:35  thresh: well, apple.
17:35  thresh: anal slavery and such, kinda got used to it :(
17:36  bdelin88: yea, I expected a lot more... really pissed that I have so much trouble hibernating the laptop...
17:36  shadewind: anyone else having problems with Google Calendar and iCal today?
17:37  bdelin88: alright well thanks guys
17:37  shadewind: suddenly stopped working
17:39  torchie: hibernation
17:39  torchie: maaaaan

18:19  eagles0513875: im having issues with mac ports not able to install subversions for me
18:22  ayaz: eagles0513875: Any particular errors it may be giving out?
18:27  webPragmatist: does firewire provide power?
18:28  webPragmatist: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817729013&Tpk=tangopro
18:28 +Branes: On 6-pin and 9-pin connectors, yes.
18:29  webPragmatist: think that guy needs the usb to power?
18:31 +Branes: That would depend on how power-hungry the drive is that you put inside.
18:32  bdelin88: mac is easy my ass this is ridiculous why I can't add a shared windows printer
18:32  webPragmatist: ah its a normal 5400rpm
18:32  bdelin88: !@*#&!@#
18:32 +Branes: I have a box similar to that, with a 650 mA drive in it. It can be powered just off either FireWire port, but for USB I need to use a dual-headed cable.
18:32 +Branes: bdelin88: Sometimes installing Bonjour for Windows helps a lot. That's Apple's zeroconf system.
18:34  eagles0513875: hey ayaz you get the error message i posted?
18:35  ayaz: eagles0513875: Nope, sorry, I did not get any messages from you.

18:42  eagles0513875: i have no other mac ports installed 
18:42  eagles0513875: and im on 10.6.5
18:44  bdelin88: Branes: I am supposed to install that on the windows computer with the printer?
18:45 +Branes: Yes.
18:45  webPragmatist: I'm cursious
18:45  webPragmatist: curious*
18:45  bdelin88: Branes: this is way over complicated
18:45  webPragmatist: with filevault… when i logout it says clearing free space
18:45  eagles0513875: Branes: do you know if the current subversion macport works with 10.6.5
18:46 +Branes: No idea, eagles.

18:48  bdelin88: Branes: thnx m8
18:48  torchie: what is a programming language
18:48  torchie: a miserable little pile of secrets!
18:50  webPragmatist: does it like slowely clear out the sparsebundle?
18:53  webPragmatist: whats up withe the apple website
18:53  webPragmatist: itunes 11 already?
18:53  TheNumb: webPragmatist: 10.1
18:54  webPragmatist: ah of course
18:54  webPragmatist: and thats enough to take up their entire homepage
18:55  TheNumb: webPragmatist: Lol, no.
18:55  TheNumb: 10.1 is already out.
18:55  webPragmatist: oh well
18:55  webPragmatist: whats the speculation/>
18:55  TheNumb: webPragmatist: http://www.macrumors.com/
18:56  TheNumb: Or maybe they are releaseing iTunes for Linux <3
18:57  webPragmatist: ugh
18:57  webPragmatist: i hate filevault
18:58  webPragmatist: this is the millionth time i've had problems with it not deleting crap
18:58  webPragmatist: i have 17gb free and just cleared out like 130gb and it won't give it to me
19:05  webPragmatist: it's like i need to mount the sparseimage
19:05  webPragmatist: and clear free space on it?
19:05  DarkStar1: Hi ppl can I ask what the average reported temp is for anyone using mbp with an operational profile for running 2 browsers and word?
19:06  DarkStar1: registering 51 degrees C atm
19:06  webPragmatist: a billion degrees
19:07  DarkStar1: and that feels quite warm on my lap
19:07  DarkStar1: Well that's the quoted temp for the CeePeeYou :)
19:09  webPragmatist: DarkStar1: is your lappy plugged in?
19:09  webPragmatist: mines at about 54de
19:09  webPragmatist: thats probably about 5-10% average cpu use
19:16  webPragmatist: i think i'm going to just reinstall without filevault 
19:16  webPragmatist: ugh
19:19  webPragmatist: i'm curious
19:19  aL3x: reinstalling without filevault is better than  beingdead, like that guy  i saw htis morning
19:19  webPragmatist: aL3x:eh?
19:20  aL3x: webPragmatist: i saw a dead guy this morning...it was disturbing. on the way to get coffee, a really bad mototcycle accident along highway 1
19:20  atmosx: webPragmatist: Why do you use filevault?
19:20  webPragmatist: atmosx: guess because i had no reason not to
19:20  atmosx: webPragmatist: hmmm except from the fact that apple's (dmg) encryption and filevault are not 'secure' enough for paranoids
19:20  Angostura: The main problem with it is the way it interacts with Time Machine
19:21  atmosx: webPragmatist: as far as I know it creates many problems to third party apps
19:21  atmosx: Time Machine is the most famous
19:21  webPragmatist: i don't use time machine
19:21  atmosx: webPragmatist: if you need encryption, use TrueCrypt
19:21  webPragmatist: and the only problem i've had is with the way it interacts with dropbox
19:21  webPragmatist: atmosx: pretty seemless?
19:21  webPragmatist: seam*
19:21  Angostura: atmosx: I think you'd have to be pretty paranoid to think Filevault and dmgs is insufficiently secure
19:22  atmosx: webPragmatist: no, you have to mount it.
19:22  atmosx: Angostura: what's the purpose of encryption if you are NOT paranoid?
19:22  webPragmatist: hrm okay
19:22  webPragmatist: i have an interesting question
19:22  webPragmatist: this is unrealated
19:22  webPragmatist: unrelated*
19:22  webPragmatist: is it possible to use symlinks that "merge" themself… similar to how windows has libraries now
19:23  Angostura: atmosx: AES-128, not good enough for you?
19:23  webPragmatist: basically a Downloads dir that when i plugin a drive it also contains more files
19:23  atmosx: Angostura: it's not the algorythm. It's the implenentation that's faulty
19:23  Angostura: [citation needed]
19:24  atmosx: Angostura: http://crypto.nsa.org/vilefault/23C3-VileFault.pdf
19:25  webPragmatist: ideas on this merge stuff?
19:25  Angostura: and dmgs?
19:25  webPragmatist: no just external drives?
19:25  atmosx: FileVault is limited to encrypting home directories only, and those directories in their entirety. FileVault cannot encrypt an entire disk.
19:25  webPragmatist: well what's the fault there?
19:25  webPragmatist: i don't care if anything else is encrypted
19:26  Angostura: Also that critique of Filevault was in 10.4.x
19:26  atmosx: Angostura: and...?
19:27  atmosx: you should seek 10.5/6 changelog. I don't see any differences
19:27  atmosx: the TimeMachine issue is as old as it gets
19:27  Angostura: and I  can show critques of Truecrypt from the same period showing it was broken
19:27  atmosx: it was actually
19:28  atmosx: you are right, TrueCrypt does not upgrade it's software as soon as a new release of OSX comes to mainstream users
19:28  atmosx: as a positive thing though, truecrypt containers are not tied to any OS
19:29  atmosx: webPragmatist: I don't understand what's the merge staff you're talking about
19:29  atmosx: I don't use windows since ... ages :-/
19:30  webPragmatist: atmosx: well… it's similar to i guess a smart folder in mac?
19:30  londonmet050: is there any way I can stop certian modules being loaded at boot time
19:36  beterraba: i love mac!

19:37  masu3701: better then windows.. :(
19:37  atmosx: masu3701: and linux

19:37  masu3701: atmosx: linux is great if you understand how things work
19:37  masu3701: mac was built off linux
19:38 --- aL3x is now known as alexlea
19:38  jeremyw: Linux has an intuitive UI like Windows and Mac OS X.  It's not a requirement you be a techie any longer.
19:39  jeremyw: Gnome/KDE/etc make it as easy to point-click as Windows/Mac OSX provide.
19:39  atmosx: masu3701: okay
19:39  atmosx: jeremyw: So, you can configure skype's voice ... by click and what?
19:39  atmosx: jeremyw: there are manyn many mainstream programs that don't run just like that, after you've installed them via GUI
19:40  jeremyw: Huh?
19:40  atmosx: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype
19:40  atmosx: ...
19:40  atmosx: to mention one 
19:40  atmosx: I see a nice command line guide there
19:41  jeremyw: Well, Ubuntu has a UI for the package manager.
19:41  eagles0513875: jeremyw: there is one for mac ports as well
19:41  jeremyw: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype can easily translate to opening the package manager UI, called Package Manager, and searching for skype.
19:41  jeremyw: It's not hard atmosx.
19:41  eagles0513875: porticus
19:41  jeremyw: It's time to play with Linux instead of assuming it's all terminal based.
19:41  atmosx: jeremyw: for me not. I know a FreeBSD core team member. If you ask him, to write a linux module for your needs 'it's not that hard' ... Thanks, if you're writing FreeBSD kernel code, no it's not.
19:42  jeremyw: I can open the Ubuntu Package Manager and install skype by point/click.  Stupid simple.
19:42  eagles0513875: hey guys on xcode i have a repository which i want to access with out a user name and password so i can pull some code to work on but not commit
19:42  atmosx: jeremyw: it might not work. It did not on mny notebook
19:42  eagles0513875: almost what ya trying to do
19:42  beterraba: How to show ony icons on firefox
19:42  beterraba: How to show only icons on firefox's favourites bar?
19:43  jeremyw: eagles0513875: I think if you access the repository outside of Xcode and let the SCm cache your perms, you could access it without username/password in Xcode.
19:43  eagles0513875: jeremyw: i am having issues with subversion in mac ports using porticus and its taking ages to get it setup
19:43  eagles0513875: i thought xcode would allow me to bypass
19:43  torchie: whoa whoa whoa
19:43  eagles0513875: the whole macports and 
19:43  torchie: mac os is not linux
19:43  eagles0513875: torchie: haha
19:43  jeremyw: eagles0513875: Install my binary: tinyurl.com/svn-osx
19:43  torchie: on a side note
19:44  eagles0513875: nm jeremyw it worked
19:44  eagles0513875: :) 
19:44  eagles0513875: viva xcode
19:44  jeremyw: eagles0513875: Wait...I bet you're running into the issue where Xcode is hard linked against the Apple supplied Subversion.
19:44  jeremyw: Okay, cool.
19:44  torchie: I may get a pc
19:44  eagles0513875: jeremyw: nope
19:44  eagles0513875: torchie: PC FTL
19:44  eagles0513875: MAC AND LINUX FTW
19:44  torchie: and I just took another look at the L series
19:44  torchie: 412's kinda legit actually
19:45  quizme: hey guys.
19:46  jeremyw: All of the tools I use are cross platform so I don't care which OS I use as long as it's not Windows.
19:47  quizme: i have a macbook air with a solid state drive, but i can hear my HD crunching away.  Any idea what it's doing?  how can i make it calm down?  It sounds like it's constantly indexing something... maybe it's the spotlight index?
19:59  torchie: eagles: i meant a pc to install linux on

21:13  Rothbard: Hello, is there any key can I press to boot via USB?
21:14  alexlea: Rothbard: option
21:14  alexlea: you can only boot hfs from usb, i believe...well, w/o having to do extra stuff anyway
21:14  Rothbard: thanks alexlea 
21:15  alexlea: yw
21:16  Rothbard: because I reinstalled Mac OS X via USB and now it doesn't recognize my old Administrator Account... I think I have to boot another time via USB and change the password, is it right?
21:16  alexlea: Rothbard: I'm not sure if i know what  you are saying. Did you do a fresh install or what
21:17  Rothbard: I had a broken 10.6.5, then I reinstalled Mac OS X 10.6
21:17  Rothbard: without formating hd
21:18  alexlea: yes, but did you do a fresh install or an archive/install
21:18  Rothbard: archive I think
21:19  alexlea: how does usb play into this? Did you have an OSX install DVD on a usb device?
21:19  Rothbard: Yes
21:19  Rothbard: I mounted the .dmg from DVD to the usb
21:20  hamiltop: Branes: Hey, I was on here earlier asking about a water spill problem
21:20  hamiltop: the machine is disconnected from the battery, and will be in a tub of rice as soon as I get home
21:20 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraX]
21:21  alexlea: the password should have stayed the same Rothbard, but obviously something weird happened. Yeah, if you boot form usb, there is an option to reset the password...not sure what menu item it is under though
21:21  Rothbard: ok, I'm going to try, thank you alexlea :)
21:21  hamiltop: but when I disconnected the battery, I noticed that something on the power board had blown.  It's a little component, 3 connections, and says p7 on it.  Any ideas?
21:22  alexlea: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1274  expandthe part about resetting administrato
21:22  alexlea: ^^ Rothbard
21:22  alexlea: "Resetting the original administrator account password" i mean
21:22  hamiltop: Anyone here have any idea what the P7 component on the magsafe board is?  My guess is that it's a voltage regulator or a tristate driver.
21:23  hamiltop: Or does anyone know of any resources which might help me figure out what it is?
21:23  alexlea: hamiltop: i dont know what it is, but i know you can get a whole new magsafe board for like 30 bux
21:23  hamiltop: alexlea:  link?
21:24  alexlea: hamiltop: i have to find one....it's been months since i last looked
21:24  alexlea: you are tlaking about the part the adapter plugs into, correct?
21:24  hamiltop: yes
21:24  hamiltop: the tiny little board in the corner...
21:24  alexlea: it's called the "dc-in" board i believe...um what model mac you got
21:24  hamiltop: 2009 macbook pro
21:24  hamiltop: (august 2009)

21:25  MariusAZ: Hi
21:25  alexlea: hey MariusAZ

21:26  MariusAZ: I found Pumpkin Spice and Eggnog electronic cigarette juice
21:26  MariusAZ: It's freakin yum
21:26  alexlea: omg...lol
21:26  alexlea: hamiltop: why do you think that part is the culprit btw
21:27  hamiltop: the machine will boot up and run, but the battery won't charge
21:27  MariusAZ: That's usually a spent battery
21:27  alexlea: hamiltop: when did hte spill happen?
21:27  hamiltop: Saturday night
21:27  MariusAZ: eww
21:27  hamiltop: the battery works fine
21:27  MariusAZ: Yeah, that's a logic board replacement
21:27  alexlea: hamiltop: if i were you, i would turn it off and leave it off
21:27  hamiltop: it is off
21:28  hamiltop: battery disconnected
21:28  alexlea: hamiltop: i would also clean it with somethinglike electrosolve
21:28  MariusAZ: You have Applecare?
21:28  hamiltop: no
21:28  MariusAZ: Well, doesn't matter anyways, it's not covered
21:28  alexlea: hamiltop: it may not be your dc in board, it can be the battery cnnector
21:28  hamiltop: the battery does charge though... slowly....
21:28  hamiltop: but it never reports as charging
21:28  MariusAZ: That's an expensive repair
21:28  hamiltop: System profiler showed a slow increase in battery
21:29  alexlea: hamiltop: many people have had their machines work after a spill, and hen die cause they never let them dry completely.... you really need to clean it, etc and let it dry instead of risking total death
21:29  hamiltop: yeah that's what I'm doing now
21:29  MariusAZ: What spilled on it?  Water?
21:29  hamiltop: I've opened it up, cleaned it with isoproply
21:29  hamiltop: yeah just water
21:29  alexlea: the problemwith water is he minerals and stuff in it
21:30  hamiltop: yeah... I noticed oxidation on some components, so I cleaned them the best I could
21:30  Tsavo: Especially if it was Dasani water
21:30  MariusAZ: Radio shack has this electronics cleaner stuff
21:30  MariusAZ: isopropyl alcohol isn't good for electronics
21:30  alexlea: if you see oxidation,then you def need a contact cleaner (such as electrosolve)
21:30  MariusAZ: Yep, electrosolve
21:30  alexlea: stuff is like  bux i think
21:30  alexlea: 6 bux*
21:31  Tsavo: Vinegar works
21:31  alexlea: as for the battery not charging right, it can be the dc-in board OR the battery conenctor cable, i think theycall it battery with sleep light board, or something, i dunno
21:31  MariusAZ: The thing of it is with electronics, if it's already acting like its fried, it's fried
21:31  alexlea: it can also be hte logic board
21:31  hamiltop: k... well the DC-in board does have a fried component...  that much I know
21:31  hamiltop: the P7 whatever is disconnected from 2 of it's three solder points
21:32  alexlea: ok, well, clean off eh oxidation, let it dry, and replace the board...then sell it while it still appears to work
21:32  MariusAZ: And you're plugging power into it?
21:32  hamiltop: not anymore
21:32  hamiltop: I was, but then decided to let it dry out before I tinker with it
21:33  MariusAZ: Put it in a zip lock bag full of rice and leave it there for a week
21:33  alexlea: you think?!? :P  lol
21:33  alexlea: ^^ hamiltop not MariusAZ
21:33  alexlea: i wouldnt put it in rice
21:33  alexlea: but thats me
21:33  hamiltop: but when it was running, it ran fine off of battery, fine off of AC, but it wouldn't get to a charging state.  The kernel_task was hovering at 85%, rending it a half useless laptop...
21:33  MariusAZ: And then a week later, it'll still be F'ed
21:34  alexlea: i woudl spray the f*** out of it with chemicals and let it air dry
21:34  alexlea: and then i would sell it, cause i would never trust it
21:34  alexlea: though,i am using a mid 2006 white macbok core 2 duo that was once dead back in dec 2007
21:35  torchie: WHOO
21:35  alexlea: dec 2006 i mean
21:35  torchie: dec 2006 white macbook core 2 duo brothers
21:35  alexlea: anyway, it was dead, which is how i ended up with it...and i took it apart  cleaned it....and it has worked fine ever since
21:35  derp: Hmm
21:35  derp: The Apple website has displayed a cryptic message
21:35  torchie: cryptic message = important thing
21:35  derp: For tomorrow at 10:00 AM EST
21:36  alexlea: link

21:36  alexlea: now they have me curious
21:37  alexlea: and what the hell could itunes have to announce, they worded it as tho itunes is a person or something
21:37 @Tu13es: WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN WHY HAVENT I HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT
21:37  alexlea: Tu13es: you did hear about it...NOW
21:37  alexlea: lol
21:37  derp: According to many sources
21:37 @Tu13es: oh wait, i did hear about it from about 30 sources
21:37 @Tu13es: my bad
21:37  alexlea: :P
21:37  derp: tek tok canada says it's about Apple TV
21:37  derp: CrunchGear sez a streaming iTUnes
21:38  derp: Huffington Post sez 4.2
21:38  alexlea: free music, all you can dl for one day only?
21:38  alexlea: lol
21:39 * derp sez iOS 4.2
21:39  MariusAZ: 4.2 is just a bunch of bug fixes though
21:39  derp: But look
21:39  derp: the title itself is another hint
21:40  derp: Tomorrow is just another day. That you'll never forget.
21:40  londonmet050: yo guys
21:40  MariusAZ: What are they turning their Daylight Savings time Bug into a feature?
21:40  alexlea: lol
21:40  derp: SOunds like a beatles song...
21:40  londonmet050: Some module is blocking usb keyboard amd mouse
21:40  alexlea: derp: ok, so you think they are getting beatles now
21:40  derp: maybe
21:40  MariusAZ: That'll never happen 
21:40  alexlea: didt people think that years ago, basedon the title of an itunes event
21:40  derp: dunno
21:40  derp: lol
21:40  londonmet050: is there away to track and disable certain modules
21:40  MariusAZ: Not until Yoko dies
21:41  derp: heck
21:41  alexlea: and also, who cares if itunes has beatles...not like you cant get them form other places...and besides they are overrated
21:41  derp: i have a appoitement at the apple store
21:41  derp: :P
21:41  MariusAZ: Exactly
21:41  alexlea: if pulp fiction is right and people are either elvis or beatles, then i am elvis
21:41  MariusAZ: Yeah, I like Elvis
21:42  alexlea: The Beatles are better though, objectively, because they wrote their own music
21:42  alexlea: Elvis was *just* a performer
21:42  derp: Speakign of elvis, a québecois singer did a virtual duo for Viva Elvis
21:42  alexlea: but i was a huge elvis fan as a kid
21:48  tsmith: If you are given a mac computer, is it possible to install Windows 7 on it?
21:48  S_SubZero: if it's an Intel Mac, sure.
21:49  tsmith: how can i tell?
21:49 +Berzerker: how old is it?
21:49 +Berzerker: was it made after 2005?
21:50 +Branes: If it is an Intel based laptop, the name will be MacBook-something. If it has a non-intel chip, it'll say PowerBook.
21:50  tsmith: yes
21:50  alexlea: what's the deal with voiced people? why are some people voiced, and what does it actually do for them
21:50 +Berzerker: if you have voice, you're an op
21:50 +Berzerker: just not oped
21:50 +Branes: I'm voiced and I've no idea alex

21:53 +Berzerker: but I don't think she's got ops...
21:54  alexlea: i jsut know she invaded #macosx a few months ago and 5 regulars got banned, at least
21:54  alexlea: she's evil
21:54 +Berzerker: your disapproval is noted.
21:54  alexlea: or "he" rather...but i am not goinf into that
21:54 +Berzerker: she's just got voiec

21:55  thelostpatrol: what's the default desktop icon size in snow leo?
21:55 +Berzerker: 512x512?
21:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
21:55  augi01: 64x64.
21:55  Rothbard: alexlea, it didn't work... it stil ask me for Administrator's password for example when I want to install something via Software Update. I put the correct one and it shows: "You must type an administrator's name and password...". If I leave it blank or I type wrong password or name it says it is incorrect
21:55  MariusAZ: And then that virus
21:56  alexlea: Rothbard: resetting it is all i know to do; maybe try the single user method without the usb... 
21:56  MariusAZ: Damnit where the F is fedex
21:56 +Berzerker: thelostpatrol: if you make an icon in icon composer, the max size is 512x512
21:56  MariusAZ: It needs to be 512x512 
21:56  alexlea: Berzerker: i think he wants to know the default display size
21:56  MariusAZ: That's the minimum
21:56  thelostpatrol: i mean displayed size. augi01, thanks.
21:57  londonmet050: what is the apple event
21:57  alexlea: Rothbard: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080414140636495  should work for 10.1 too

21:58  Rothbard: ok alexlea , i'm going to try, thank you :)
21:58  augi01: londonmet050: Rumor is Apple will announce some sort of streaming-subscription for iTunes.
21:58  londonmet050: ok
21:58  londonmet050: nice
21:58  MariusAZ: I know some other rumors
21:58  alexlea: rburton-: good luck
22:01  torchie: subscription?
22:01  torchie: doesn't sound like a new 13 inch macbook pro
22:01  MariusAZ: macbooks and macbook pro's won't be updated until 2011
22:01  MariusAZ: Apple's done with their 2010 christmas lineup

22:20  Daskreech:  well to tell the truth I have installed but I'm very confused as to how it's used
22:20  Daskreech:  I port installed sshfs-gui and it would not allow me to connect to the server
22:20  Daskreech: There was a key trust issue since I had not accepted the other authenticty of the server
22:21  bassliner: Daskreech: you of course would have to add it's authenticity once.
22:21  Daskreech: once I did that from the terminal it accepted the password fine and as far as I know it connects but I have no idea where it is mounting to
22:21  bassliner: ah see
22:21  Daskreech: bassliner: of coruse :) so I did
22:21  Daskreech: course
22:22  bassliner: Daskreech: i don't know sshfs-gui and i have no clue where it mounts stuff to, but you could just use sshfs from the commandline
22:22  bassliner: Daskreech: it's almost self eplanatory
22:22  Daskreech: just mount blah remote:dir/blah -p sshfs ?
22:32  Daskreech: bassliner: Just that I'm setting this up for someone who is comfortable around technology but not gung ho to get fingers dirty

23:34 @crilly: You could likely boot from a USB device.

23:37  S_SubZero: a specific tool could do the job but I only know Windows-based tools.
23:37 @crilly: Juo: Just open the ISO, collect the contents, preserving the structure, then place them on the drive.
23:37  b0o-yeah: IDK when you "burn" a cd is there actually any burning ? 
23:37 +Tomis: you just image the ISO to the disk, simple as that
23:37  Juo: crilly: yeah thats what ive done, thanks, just waiting for the files to copy across, its a slow drive 
23:46  CPng|N: what he really is trying to address is how to make it bootable.  just copying the files won't render it a bootable usbdrive will it?

23:47  Lusule: hi guys, I'm looking for some help with applescript, I don't know if this is the right channel.  I have a script that outputs a list of flagged items from Omnifocus, and I'd like to make it so the list is bulleted, is that possible?
23:48 @crilly: Lusule: I'm wondering if that is the responsibility of the application receiving the items?
23:48 @crilly: CPng|N: Good point.
23:48  Lusule: it's just an applescript, it can be called by anything that calls it.  I did have it output the list just to a file, but I realised that wasn't necessary for my purposes and changed it.
23:50  Lusule: i imagine that formatting an applescripted list with bullets would be the same commands whichever program you're using for input and output on this occasion
23:50  Lusule: if it's even possible at all, that is
23:51 @crilly: Hmm
23:51 @crilly: I've never really examined AppleScript in a lot of detail, if I'm to be honest.
23:52  Lusule: i think this question would need someone familiar with it yes :) i was hoping there would be someone here, I haven't been able to find an applescript specific chat room.
