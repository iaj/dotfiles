00:01  yazdmich: how can OSX install a printer (like a Lexmark printer on a wifi network) in a single click?
00:04  crilly: yazdmich, the printer will announce its make and model, and OS X will obtain the drivers.
00:04  yazdmich: ah
00:04  yazdmich: so easy
00:04  crilly: I think Bonjour can do that, anyway.
00:05  yazdmich: imma play portal
00:05  yazdmich: wait

01:31  jen_: I am using Safari 5.03. I notice autocomplete in google is not working - is this a Safari setting or Google?
01:32  unrealjeff: hey macintosh friends
01:33  richardcavell: Hey Jeff
01:33  unrealjeff: hey
01:34  unrealjeff: richardcavell: what did you get ptsd from?
01:34  richardcavell: I got into conflict with some criminals and they bashed me
01:34  unrealjeff: oh :(
01:34  richardcavell: When I was a medical student, more than 10 years ago
01:34  unrealjeff: what is bashed?
01:34  richardcavell: Punched/kicked
01:35  unrealjeff: what is bashed :(
01:36  richardcavell: I just told you
01:36  richardcavell: Beaten
01:36  richardcavell: Assaulted
01:37  unrealjeff: sorry
01:37  unrealjeff: i accidentally pressed the up arrow i guess
01:37  unrealjeff: i meant to say
01:37  unrealjeff: sorry man :(
01:38  richardcavell: it's ok
01:38  richardcavell: not your fault
01:38  richardcavell: the important thing is I'm getting therapy
01:39  unrealjeff: good
01:39  unrealjeff: i hope you make a full recovery
01:40  richardcavell: yeah me too
02:05  nexus74: hello
02:05  richardcavell: hi
02:07  crilly: richardcavell, do you know about Moof Speak?
02:08  richardcavell: nope
02:10  ErrantEgo: how do you format a hard drive on OS X to where it will work in Windows XP?
02:10  ErrantEgo: my dad said to format it to FAT 
02:10  ErrantEgo: but my PC doesnt see it
02:11  nexus74: ntfs?
02:11  nexus74: file system
02:11  nexus74: I'm not sure XP uses FAT
02:11  ErrantEgo: well, as i said
02:12  ErrantEgo: i cant even format it on the PC
02:12  ErrantEgo: because it doesnt see it
02:12  nexus74: oh ok..
02:12  ErrantEgo: its not showing up in My Computer
02:12  nexus74: have you tried doing it in DOS?
02:12  ErrantEgo: HOW?
02:12  ErrantEgo: its not seeing it
02:12  nexus74: go to Start->Run
02:12  nexus74: type cmd
02:12  nexus74: that will bring up the prompt
02:13  ErrantEgo: how will i know which drive letter to use?
02:13  ErrantEgo: i know how to get to the command prompt
02:13  nexus74: is there any data on the drive at all?
02:13  ErrantEgo: im trying to at least get it mounted
02:13  ErrantEgo: from there i should be good to go
02:13  nexus74: I just showed you how to get to the command prompt…scroll back
02:13  ErrantEgo: but it needs to grab a drive letter
02:13  ErrantEgo: which its not
02:13  ErrantEgo: i know how to get to the command prompt
02:13  nexus74: ok
02:13  ErrantEgo: the drive is brand new, so no
02:14  ErrantEgo: but its mac formatted
02:14  nexus74: that's odd that your PC is not seeing it..
02:14  nexus74: tried rebooting?
02:14  ErrantEgo: yep
02:15  ErrantEgo: imma try it one more time
02:15  nexus74: tried going into bios at start up?
02:15  ErrantEgo: no not yet...
02:15  ErrantEgo: im going to start over 
02:16  ErrantEgo: do you know of any other ways to format the drive other than disk utility?
02:17  nexus74: DOS or Windows GUI
02:18  ErrantEgo: im talking about within the mac
02:18  nexus74: oh...
02:18  nexus74: I thought you were trying to get a Windows machine to recognize a drive
02:18  ErrantEgo: yes
02:19  ErrantEgo: i've got all night
02:19  ErrantEgo: im starting over
02:19  nexus74: wait, you're not trying to format a drive on your Mac for use on your Windows machine, are you???
02:21  nexus74: Don't do that...
02:22  nexus74: Windows XP borrowed from Windows NT.  That's why XP is way more stable than Win9x.  Therefore XP should have NTFS file system available
02:23  nexus74: I would go with that
02:23  Kasm279: should have
02:23  Kasm279: it does
02:23  Kasm279: derp
02:23  nexus74: I switched to mac in 06 so I'm not up on my XP knowledge…just trying to help
02:25  numberz: if you look in administrative tools you'll find a disk management thing
02:26  nexus74: numberz: I think he may be actually trying to format it on his Mac for use in Windows…not sure why he's doing it that way
02:26  unrealjeff: we wish you a happy christmas, we wish you a happy christmas, we wish you a happy christmas and a happy christmas.
02:26  nexus74: lol..Merry Christmas Jeff, Happy New Year!!
02:26  numberz: why not just use bootcamp?
02:27  nexus74: ahhh…great idea!
02:27  nexus74: wish I'd thought of that.  He's going to need XP **with** service pack 2
02:27  nexus74: it won't work otherwise...

03:01  nexus74: .
03:03  unrealjeff: so. do macboks have 4k sreens or do they cost 1500 dollars for no reason
03:03  nexus74: 4k screens?
03:03  nexus74: Apple products have always been at a premium
03:03  nexus74: in fact, it's what hurt them in the beginning
03:04  unrealjeff: 4k resolution
03:04  unrealjeff: what is premium
03:04  nexus74: ah
03:04  S_SubZero: The Macbook has a 1280x800 screen.
03:04  nexus74: in other words, mac products have always been considered more expensive as compared to pc's
03:05  unrealjeff: indeed
03:06  unrealjeff: i saw an HP with a gig more of the sam RAM. i5 processor compared to core 2 duo on the macbook pro. and a 15 inch screen compared to a 13 inch on the macbook pro. for almost $500 dollars less than the macbook pro 
03:06  unrealjeff: uhhhm
03:06  nexus74: yup
03:06  unrealjeff: why?
03:07  Swian: because people will pay it
03:07 --- Guest84296 is now known as Bensawsome
03:07  nexus74: well a number of reasons.  Apple claims "We don't sell crap"
03:07  unrealjeff: but it was the same type of RAM the same brand processor.
03:07  nexus74: is HP using high quality components, i.e. power supplies, who makes the screen? OR, Apple's profit margin is just considerably higher
03:08  Swian: I built a smoking PC for a freelance client ALL top of the line hardware, i7 cpu, 12gb gaming ram, 2x2.5tb hds, blue ray, and it was half what a base mac tower is
03:08  nexus74: Apple doesn't make their own harddrives, memory...
03:08  unrealjeff: i don't care about screen resolution. idk why apples needs to be so much. since all you would be doing is freakin web browsing
03:08  nexus74: It's funny, you can buy memory for **hundreds** less if you buy from a third party vs. Apple
03:08  Swian: yep
03:09  unrealjeff: 1920x1080 is enough for me
03:09  nexus74: I even went to the Apple's forums, and they straight out told me "There is no difference in the more expensive memory"
03:09  unrealjeff: lol
03:10  Swian: and yet I still like Macs
03:10  Swian: just don't buy new
03:10  Swian: for web surfing, mail, photos etc, this mini is great
03:10  nexus74: But people get leery and figure that "it needs to be made by Apple for it to work in my mac" and honestly, people just don't want the take the time to shop arround..
03:10  unrealjeff: indeed. i think in the future i will purchase an emac
03:10  S_SubZero: part of paying extra is they do it for you.  Not that changing the RAM on a Mac is typically difficult, but "they do it for you."  
03:10  Swian: I have a nice PC for gaming and such
03:11  nexus74: That's right.  Get a mac-mini, by a Samsung or some other monitor and you're good to go!
03:11  nexus74: Alot of lower cost, good quality monitors out there
03:11  Swian: hell I changed it on the mini and that wasn't that big a deal
03:11  unrealjeff: lol
03:11  Swian: I have an acer 22" does me fine
03:11  unrealjeff: dude im so happy that you guys aren't super mac lovers
03:11  Swian: I like them
03:11  nexus74: Apple's monitors are like their memory, in the aspect that theirs is WAY more expensive
03:11  unrealjeff: LG 22" flatron
03:11  Swian: but I still think buying a new mac is nuts
03:12  nexus74: $2k for a monitor that you can buy for $300 with a name brand
03:12  unrealjeff: Swian: it's the only way to upgrade your system in the apple world
03:12  Swian: not necessary for me
03:12  nexus74: Yes, I really like apple products as well, but some of their pricing boggles me
03:12  Swian: I got a mini on amazon for $450
03:13  nexus74: Swian: What are the specs?
03:14  Swian: 1.83ghz 2gb ram, 80gb hd
03:14  nexus74: good, but only 80GB hd??
03:14  Swian: does everything I need
03:14  Swian: I have a file server and external hds
03:14  nexus74: ah
03:14  nexus74:  ok
03:15  Swian: got my wife a 1.66 for $350
03:15  nexus74: nice
03:15  Swian: then spent another $30 to max the ram to 2gb
03:15  Swian: which was third party I put in
03:15  nexus74: that's good…you definitely didn't get the ram from Apple...lol
03:15  Swian: nope
03:16  Swian: its laptop ram
03:16  nexus74: never buy memory from Apple
03:16  Swian: I had some but only a gig and I wanted to max it out
03:16  Swian: I never have
03:16  nexus74: yup, my iMac is maxed
03:16  nexus74: my iMac is from 2006
03:16  nexus74: looking at Apple store right now...
03:17  Swian: I had a G4/400 I got in 200X and upgraded the cpu to 1.25gh, ram to 2gb, HD to 200gb, video card to a nice Nvidia and just sold it a few months back
03:17  Swian: all the upgrades were NOT apple
03:17  Swian: the CPU upgrade was from sonnet
03:17  Swian: i have a white 20" iMac G4 right next to me
03:18  Swian: still works fine
03:18  Swian: but a little sluggish with 10.5 on it
03:18  nexus74: see that's the thing about Apple, there products seem to have great longevity
03:18  Swian: oh yeah
03:18  Swian: my fav mac was my 8600/300
03:18  Swian: with all the av ports
03:18  Swian: I miss that machine
03:19  nexus74: Apple store: 27inch iMac 2.93 quad core with 16 gb ram and 1TB drive:  $3200
03:19  Swian: too much
03:19  nexus74: knock that down to lowest memory, 4GB and it's down to $2200
03:19  Swian: still too much
03:20  Swian: I could build a desktop better than that for $600-$800
03:20  nexus74: but that's iMac, so I can't upgrade the CPU by a third party
03:20  nexus74: oh Yeah, desktops (PC's) are waayyyy cheaper
03:20  Swian: I know I'm locked in with the mini, but Its a nice little machine
03:20  nexus74: I maxed out a Mac Pro on Apple store: almost 10k
03:20  nexus74: but then again, it had two screens
03:21  Swian: I can't justify that
03:21  nexus74: neither can I
03:21  nexus74: at this point
03:21  Swian: I work on windows for a living so I can justify a PC, but I build it parts at a time
03:21  Swian: so its not one big hit
03:21  nexus74: the memory and screens really drove up the costs
03:21  nexus74: wow! you can get a Mac Pro with 12 cores!!!!
03:22  Swian: last year got a quad core cpu, new ram and HD for $300
03:22  nexus74: 6gb ram, 1 tb drive, 1gb graphics card: $5k
03:22  Swian: yeah, read about that a while back
03:23  Swian: at the time that article I saw only servers and macs were getting those, not cpus you could buy for general use
03:23  Swian: my quad core pc still works great
03:23  nexus74: does the multiple cores actually cause your apps to run faster?
03:23  Swian: yes
03:24  Swian: things like photoshop do
03:24  Swian: I also do alot of MMORPGs
03:24  nexus74: Do the apps have to be written to take advantage of multi core?
03:24  Swian: but those are GPU intense
03:24  Swian: they should be
03:24  nexus74: lol…that won't be a prob with 1GB video card...
03:24  Swian: i have a 1gb card
03:25  nexus74: really?
03:25  Swian: Photoshop has been multi-cpu for a while
03:25  nexus74: notice a huge diff in your graphics?
03:25  Swian: I did
03:25  nexus74: I would love to see a screen shot of one of your games
03:25  Swian: I was able to kick up the settings in WOW to max
03:25  Swian: I don't do first person shooters
03:25  nexus74: very cool
03:25  Swian: just MMORPGs
03:26  nexus74: I was playing wow for a while, but I got bored withit
03:26  Swian: and honestly Guild Wars looks better than all of them for graphics
03:26  Swian: best lighting and textures
03:27  Swian: I dual boot the pc to linux, but since I got the mini, haven't really been doing linux much
03:27  nexus74: does boot camp support linux?
03:27  Swian: also got tired of fighting quirks
03:27  S_SubZero: nexus74: No.
03:27  Swian: It does but with a KVM and multiple machines, why
03:28  Swian: Not boot camp. but I could dual boot it
03:28  Swian: lots of people do
03:28  nexus74: i see
03:28  Swian: I don't want to dual boot this mini
03:29  Swian: I have dual boot on the PC and my netbook, that's enough
03:29  nexus74: Linux is great but it can't run my apps, so what's the point…just curiosity for me
03:30  shadewind: anyone know how to kill Spotlight if it's locked up?
03:30  shadewind: the progress indicator is just spinning and it shows nothing
03:31  CyberdogX: I can kill anything once I've locked it up
03:31  nexus74: hold the power button down for 10 sec. or got Finder -> force quit
03:32  shadewind: Spotlight is not part of finder
03:32  nexus74: ok, i've just been able to force quit any app through finder menu
03:33  shadewind: but it's not an app
03:33  shadewind: the spotlight menu in the upper right corner
03:33  nexus74: thought it was worth a try...
03:33  nexus74: i know
03:33  shadewind: yeah, I tried :)
03:35  nexus74: i just reinstalled snow leopard, i'm so streamlined right now…only 5gb of hard drive space being used..
03:35  nexus74: now I have to install a couple adobe apps....
03:35  nexus74: eck
03:42  Swian: now I need another beer
03:44  nexus74: lol, why's that Swain?
03:45  CyberdogX: Finished the last one
03:46  nexus74: lol!
03:46  nexus74: well that's good reason I guess
03:49  Swian: good enough reason: other can was empty
03:50  Swian: 38F in FL, nice
03:50  nexus74: ??
03:50  nexus74: I just moved from florida :(
03:50  Swian: 38 degrees
03:50  nexus74: I want to go back
03:50  Swian: to where?
03:51  nexus74: I
03:51  nexus74: I'm in st. louis now...
03:51  Swian: oh wow
03:51  nexus74: want to go back to orlando
03:51  Swian: colder
03:52  Swian: that's where I'm near
03:52  nexus74: i'm jealous
03:52  Swian: still cold here tonight
03:52  Swian: going down to 26
03:52  LaraX: I've lived in Miami
03:52  LordHawke13: Okay, problem with Apple TV.
03:52  Swian: I've been in FL since 1992
03:53  Swian: bummer
03:53  Swian: did you call tech support?
03:53  CyberdogX: New appletv?
03:53  LordHawke13: I added artwork for movie files in my iTunes library. It changed there and on the remote app for iPhone but will not change in the movies section of Apple TV.
03:53  nexus74: I moved to fl in 2001...
03:53  Swian: if its under warranty I always say call tech support
03:54  LordHawke13: It just shows the first frame of the movies as the artwork when paging through.
03:54  LordHawke13: Any ideas what I might be doin' wrong?
03:54  nexus74: adobe says that Photoshop cs5 requires 10.5.7 OS
03:54  Swian: never even seen an apple tv
03:54  Swian: yeah?
03:54  nexus74: where only up to 10.5.6.
03:54  LordHawke13: It's friggin' sweet.
03:54  Swian: I have cs 3
03:54  Kasm279: nexus74: LMFAO
03:54  nexus74: oops I mean 10.6.5
03:54  LordHawke13: It's just aggrivating I can't get the artwork for movies to change.
03:55  Swian: what do you use it for LordHawke13
03:55  nexus74: hmmm…not sure if i can run it
03:55  LordHawke13: Swian, I'm using it for movies right now.
03:55  Swian: I do netflix on my wii or blue ray player
03:55  LordHawke13: Swian, Everything, I'm streaming from my iTunes library on my computer.
03:55  Swian: I don't do movies in itunes
03:55  Swian: just music
03:55  nexus74: iTunes is clunky
03:56  Swian: its a bit bloated
03:56  nexus74: amen
03:56  nexus74: lol..i'm stalling on installing my Adobe apps...
03:56  Swian: nexus74 if you have 10.6 you can run it
03:56  nexus74: ok..thx
03:56  Swian: so what's the issue?
03:57  nexus74: s p a c e...
03:57  Swian: ahh
03:57  Swian: yes
03:57  nexus74: I'm a little ocd about my hd space..
03:57  LordHawke13: So, no thoughts?
03:57  Swian: there's always that
03:57  Swian: nope, again, never used one
03:57  nexus74: I'm running only 5GB on hd right now
03:57  LordHawke13: A place where I can reset the cache or anything?
03:57  Swian: no point of reference
03:57  LordHawke13: Hmm. . .
03:57  nexus74: my HD capacity is 250
03:57  nexus74: so I shouldn't care
03:57  Swian: that's not too bad
03:57  Swian: how much free space
03:57  nexus74: 245
03:57  Swian: ahh man
03:57  Swian: go wild
03:58  Swian: jeez
03:58  nexus74: lol…that begs the question: Does more files on the HD slow down performance, as it does in Windows
03:58  Swian: not really
03:58  nexus74: ok good
03:58  Swian: windows gets fragmented and then you need space to defrag
03:59  nexus74: does that happen in mac?
03:59  Swian: but if you run ccleaner you can keep things lean on windows too
03:59  Swian: keep the registry from getting too nasty
03:59  nexus74: yeah, windows needed to intalled about every 6 months or so
03:59  Swian: plus I reinstall the os every 6 months
03:59  Swian: hehe
03:59  Swian: yeah
03:59  nexus74: and there was a definiate note in performance
03:59  Swian: yep
03:59  nexus74: I reninstall my mac os about every 6 months too
04:00  Swian: new install boots fast, a few months later, 10 minutes
04:00  nexus74: i'm so funny about that sort of thing…. I don't know why
04:00  Swian: me too, but I'm anal about that
04:00  nexus74: Swian: about 10 min on your mac??
04:00  Swian: NOOO
04:00  Swian: windows 
04:00  nexus74: ok…I was like "man, what the heck is he installing on that thing"
04:00  Swian: 10 minutes until all boot items finish and the cpu usage drops to a decent level
04:01  Swian: but I have a lot of development stuff on my box too
04:01  nexus74: yeah Windows has that issue...
04:03  nexus74: Swian: what language do you develop in?
04:04  Swian: asp.net
04:04  Swian: C# and VB.Net
04:04  Swian: I've done Php, Perl, a little python
04:04  nexus74: wow
04:04  nexus74: I've been working with AS3 and PHP
04:04  Swian: web development mostly, but I've done some windows apps, services
04:04  nexus74: Drupal interfacing with Flash
04:05  nexus74: finally
04:06  Swian: finally installed?
04:06  nexus74: lol no, finally interfaced.  I've been wanting to have a Flash overlay drupal for a while now
04:06  nexus74: with Flash, I have complete creative control.  So I can design/animate drupal's menu any way I want
04:07  nexus74: I know Flash gets a lot of flak, but it does provide design freedoms otherwise impossible
04:07  nexus74: well, at least until HTML 5 came along
04:08  Swian: I get you, I try and stay with jquery and client side stuff for web applications when I can, avoid plugins
04:09  nexus74: yeah, that's the only thing about Flash, I wish it would run natively
04:09  nexus74: I'm not sure how adobe could change that..
04:10  nexus74: the browser would have to have APIs for all possible animations I guess
04:10  Swian: yeah, not likely 
04:10  nexus74: agreed
04:10  Swian: flash is old too
04:10  Swian: need major revamp
04:10  nexus74: what aspect?  The performance?
04:11  Swian: the architecture has been around a long time
04:11  Swian: plus every time I turn around, new update
04:11  Swian: people don't stay up on that stuff
04:11  nexus74: AS3 is now ecma standard, well it was ecma when v 3 came out
04:12  Swian: does it run without a plug in
04:12  nexus74: yeah, another draw back, you may have features that are only available on the latest player
04:12  nexus74: I know, that's what I was saying I'd like to see change
04:12  Swian: steve's not backing it
04:12  nexus74: oh, you were asking
04:13  nexus74: No Flash does not run without plug in
04:13  nexus74: Yes Apple nixed it…Performance and political reasons
04:14  nexus74: in fact, it caused an uproar in the Apple / Flash community
04:14  Swian: yep
04:14  Swian: plus I thought that was bs
04:14  Swian: don't blame a plug in for OS problems
04:14  nexus74: One of Flash's leading evangelist told Apple to "go **** themselves"
04:15  nexus74: I agree with you…the Mac OS however has performed perfectly for me.  However, Flash did manage to crash Safari today...
04:17  Swian: yeah, but I'm betting the iPad is so integrated with Safari that they can't afford it to not work
04:18  Swian: so instead of making the underlying code base more stable, blame a plug in
04:18  nexus74: probably, and I don't know if iPad will allow third-party browsers.
04:18  nexus74: I'm also hoping that Lion doesn't lock down iMac...
04:18  nexus74: I don't think it will….that would be a very bad move for Apple
04:19  CyberdogX: They won't
04:19  Swian: nope
04:19  nexus74: When i saw the app store for Mac, I got a little concerned...
04:24  nexus74: I should have known better that they wouldn't do that
04:30  richardcavell: what do you mean lock down the iMac?
04:32  nexus74: I'm just shooting from the hip…I meant locked down like iPhone / iPod
04:34  richardcavell: you mean tied to a particular telephone provider?
04:34  nexus74: no, I meant what you're allowed to install as far as apps..
04:34  richardcavell: nah, they won't do that
04:34  richardcavell: You'll always be able to write your own software
04:35  richardcavell: On my Mac I can create my own programs in XCode
04:35  nexus74: I know, it was a little foolish of me to think that
04:35  nexus74: Yes, I use Xcode as well
04:36  nexus74: For example, with all this streamiing of hardware, should apple remove the DVD drive, I was slightly concerened that the only way to install apps would be through the mac app store...
04:37  Velociraptors: I don't think I've installed anything direct from Disc in the last two years. 
04:38  nexus74: Yeah, but some apps you need to, unless you always make sure you back up your .dmg files
04:41  borreguito: Alguien habla español?
04:41  nexus74: nope
04:41  borreguito: mmmm
04:45  nexus74: borreguito: did you need help with something?
04:46  nexus74: ixixi, you are driving me nuts with entering and exiting
04:48  nexus74: borreguito: If you need help, just let us know...
04:48  borreguito: yes.... today... i did recovery an ipod nano (windows)  ....
04:49  unrealjeff: hey bubs
04:49  unrealjeff: hows you?
04:49  borreguito: now.... the ipod is Mac (system).. but   the ipod owner do not use mac.... 
04:50  nexus74: right...
04:51  borreguito: can i recovery it using iTunes for windows??  
04:51  nexus74: Is it the user's account that you are usiing?
04:51  nexus74: You're going to have trouble if your using a different account, and there will be no recovery info for the original user
04:54  borreguito: Windows Can't Read it... if  itś Machintosh system?
04:54  nexus74: Yes, Window can read an iPod because iTunes has a Windows version.
04:54  nexus74: In order to recover your friend's iPod, you need to be using his iTunes account.
04:55  nexus74: you don't want to mix iPod and user accounts
04:55  nexus74: iTunes will only let you **re-download** your media once, as a favor only.
04:55  nexus74: so becareful
04:55  nexus74: brb
04:55  unrealjeff: anyone got ubuntu woring on their macintosh PC?
04:56  borreguito: Tomorry  i will try  using itunes windows version.
04:56  nexus74: jeff, I've gotten Ubuntu working on my mac
04:56  borreguito: tomorrow... 
04:56  nexus74: borreguito: make sure  you are using the iPods owner account
04:56  nexus74: unrealjeff: I was using the "Live CD".
04:57  unrealjeff: nexus74: ahh
04:57  unrealjeff: did your system break?
04:58  nexus74: nope
04:58  nexus74: The only thing that concerned me was, that during Ubuntu boot up, the screen flicker was a little unusual and I was concerened it would damage my monitor...
04:59  nexus74: being open source, I'm not sure how much QA testing is going on with Linux distros
04:59  borreguito: an Intel MAC... can boot from  Ubuntu LiveCD????
04:59  nexus74: yes
04:59  nexus74: it's intel architecture...
04:59  borreguito: Mac is 100 Unix.  and  HFS is very secure!!!
05:00  nexus74: HFS is irrelevant, you're going off the CD alone
05:00  Guest95058: better off installing fedora

06:00  zoite: sorry
06:00  yofun: im helping a friend of mine and this mac runs slow is there any software to find out why free?
06:01  S_SubZero: how much disk space does it have?
06:01  yazdmich: i say we move this entire channel to ##osx
06:01  yazdmich: damn
06:01  yofun: umm im new to mac
06:01  yazdmich: already made
06:01  yofun: i used to windows
06:01  yofun: ...
06:01  yazdmich: what model you o?
06:01  yazdmich: on*
06:01  yofun: im on mac and it runs slow
06:01  yofun: idk
06:02  yofun: tell me how to find it
06:02  yazdmich: macbook, imac, mac mini?
06:02  yofun: emac?
06:02  S_SubZero: The only real thing printed on the hardware is the model name.
06:02  S_SubZero: eMac.
06:02  yazdmich: emac is a different company
06:02  richardcavell: no it's not
06:02  richardcavell: there was an emac
06:02  yazdmich: and apples discontinued computer for schools
06:03  yazdmich: education mac
06:03  yazdmich: eMac
06:03  S_SubZero: eMacs ran a gambit of speeds.  There are some that are just slow by 2010 standards.
06:03  yofun: is there any way i can see about speedingit up"? 
06:04  yazdmich: is it a new mac?
06:04  yazdmich: if it is
06:04  yofun: 7 years ago they said they got it
06:04  yofun: 5 or 6
06:04  yazdmich: oh
06:04  yazdmich: if it were new i would call apple
06:04  yazdmich: btw
06:04  yazdmich: i got free phone support for my mac after the 1 free mont
06:05  yazdmich: i guess its because im a kid/teen
06:05  yofun: ok im asking any way to speed up this computer so i can update is maybe?
06:05  yazdmich: i felt so awesome
06:05  yofun: or something
06:05  yazdmich: anyway
06:05  S_SubZero: those machines were typically not intended to be user upgradable.
06:06  yazdmich: all computers get old
06:06  yofun: ok any way to speed it up?
06:06  yazdmich: and slow
06:06  yofun: so theres no way?
06:06  S_SubZero: it's as fast now as it's ever likely to be.  Do you know the version of the OS on it?
06:06  yofun: can you tell me hoew to find it?
06:06  yofun: liike cmd ver?
06:06  yofun: or something
06:06  S_SubZero: in the top left of the screen, you should see an apple logo.
06:07  yazdmich: there click on about this mac
06:07  yofun: 10.3.9
06:07  netdaemon: oldy!
06:07  yofun: thats the version
06:07  yofun: lol
06:08  yazdmich: panther
06:08  yazdmich: wow
06:08  yofun: so no way?
06:08  yazdmich: its old
06:08  yazdmich: its slow
06:08  yazdmich: how much ram?
06:08  yofun: processor?
06:09  yazdmich: and how many gigahetz does the CPU have?
06:09  S_SubZero: The OS has probably been on it since it was purchased.  It may have a lot of old software on it.  Macs don't tend to slow down much with the amount of software on them but you could always reinstall the OS off the discs it came with.  "  *waits for "dont have the discs"*
06:11  yofun: she might have it she says
06:11  yofun: and if i dont?
06:11  S_SubZero: read these words very closely.  
06:11  S_SubZero: It's a sealed machine.
06:11  S_SubZero: it's not intended to be upgraded.
06:11  S_SubZero: You might be able to add RAM.  It will likely be refurbished.
06:12  S_SubZero: You have very, very limited options with this machine.
06:12  S_SubZero: There is no "put this in and make it go FASTAR" option.
06:12  S_SubZero: It's as fast now as it's ever going to be.  It's old.  Accept it.
06:12  yofun: so i can reinstall the os?
06:12  S_SubZero: you can reinstall the OS.
06:14  User: are you from CH?
06:14  S_SubZero: "no, you can absolutely NEVER reinstall the OS!!!!"   (is this an answer that is even possible?)
06:15  yofun: i mean wipe out my files etc
06:17  evilbug: S_SubZero: hey.
06:17  S_SubZero: hi
06:19  evilbug: my mbp's display will not turn on when i try booting it. hdd and ram are fine. tried resetting the smc and pram with no luck. graphics issue?
06:21  richardcavell: Well you can't even buy PPC-capable OS X from Apple anymore, can you?
06:21  evilbug: no.
06:24  unrealjeff: ubuntu 8.10 was amazing
06:26  richardcavell: You imply that the later versions aren't?
06:26  richardcavell: They're all pretty incremental improvements IMHO
06:26  richardcavell: And for running on a Mac, there's been a real improvement from 9.04->9.10->10.04
06:26  richardcavell: I would advise anyone running Ubuntu on Mac not to bother with anything less than 10.04

06:36  MrUnagi: is it possible to stream video from sftp??
06:36  zoite: you can use sshfs!
06:36  MrUnagi: now that sounds interesting
06:37  MrUnagi: but, i have a hunch, after fighting with sftp.....sshfs is going to replace that
06:37  zoite: sshfs mounts a file system over ssh
06:37  zoite: using fuse
06:37  MrUnagi: without the use of 3rd party
06:37  MrUnagi: sounds interesting
06:38  MrUnagi: i shall  fumble with it tomorrow
06:38  MrUnagi: nothing will be required on the server side right?
06:38  zoite: ssh
06:38  MrUnagi: here is an interesting question......if i have users chrooted, will sshfs work
06:39  MrUnagi: or do i have to chroot after doing sshfs
06:39  zoite: why would it not work?
06:40  MrUnagi: because i have it so that users that are part of the sftp group are chrooted to their home folder
06:40  zoite: ok
06:41  MrUnagi: im probably being silly
06:41  zoite: why can't you mount it in their directory?
06:41  MrUnagi: what is to stop them from mounting /
06:41  zoite: where
06:42  MrUnagi: where?
06:42  zoite: i asked you first
06:42  MrUnagi: (it is late, i am tired, and confused) lol

09:51  Kasm279: PascalHunger: depends on the graphics and what the CPU model is
09:52  PascalHunger: pure cpu performance
09:52  PascalHunger: will the late 07 one still outperform because of a larger l2 cache?

11:48  Velociraptors: wrong shape for an ostrich
11:48  Velociraptors: they're almost spherical

13:52  fruchthoernschen: hey Ho is it not possible to make an X11-Forwarding from MacOS X to an Linux Box ( I want to run an Linux app (X11-Forwaring) on my Mac OS X Box). 
14:44  PeanutHorst: fruchthoernschen: sure it is
14:44  PeanutHorst: if you have X11.app installed and can use ssh from the command line
14:44  PeanutHorst: and don't mind screwing around with xauth on one end
14:44  PeanutHorst: and whatnot
14:44  PeanutHorst: i never did it but i know it's possible.
14:46  fruchthoernschen: I have found the misstake ;) works great now. I have created manually the /home/$username$ dir on my Linux system and havn't changed the permissions/owner/group of the new create homedir .. so user hadn't had write access to this dir ;) stupid mistake.
15:10  jsoft: .

16:12  kamol: hi guys, where can I find some nice doc about mail server setup on mac os x server? thanks in advance.
16:13 * zer0her0 kamol: here let me google that for you: http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/resources/documentation.html
16:13 @ChrisAM: Are you running OS X server?
16:13  kamol: ChrisAM: yep
16:14 @ChrisAM: There's loads of documentation on Apple's site.
16:14  zer0her0: speaking of OS X server, time to swap out the APC on ours
16:14  zer0her0: bbiab
16:15 @ChrisAM: !g os x server mail setup

16:15  kamol: yeah, I tried, I read, but I don't know which authontification to use is better, when to use POP and when IMAP… how to setup mail server, behind router...
16:18  cliff1970: POP either pushes email, or copies it.  Too many issues with POP.  IMAP gives you direct access to each message; no push or copy.  I like IMAP better myself.
16:19  kamol: cliff1970: that's already good start :) tq cliff1970
16:20  kamol: but how about this MD5, Keyborous… Password, which is better to use?
16:23  kamol: ChrisAM: tq for http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/resources/documentation.html seems, it is nice place 
16:23 @ChrisAM: kamol ... what do your customers want for email?
16:24 @ChrisAM: zer0her0 gave you that link, but yw
16:25  kamol: ChanServ: it is one web server(mini mac os x server), so I need to setup mail server on it too. so users can send email form that domain and receive emails too.
16:25  zooky: os x server guides, I have all the PDF downloaded and on my ipad. Along with the OS X Server certification books, and the peach pit server series.
16:26  kamol: zooky: You are talking about http://www.apple.com/server/macosx/resources/documentation.html ?
16:26  zooky: kamol: mmmhhh
16:27  kamol: zooky: or it is external disk which comes with max os x server?
16:27  zooky: it's like carrying a small rainforest worth of books
16:28  kamol: got it :)
16:28  zooky: kamol: I have the disks too, those loosing the 10.6 server install disks would be bad lol
16:28  zooky: sorry I totally derailed your lets set up a email server talk. 
16:29  kamol: zooky: huh? 
16:30  zooky: "so I need to setup mail server on it too"
16:32  kamol: zooky: sorry for my english, … I just replied to ChrisAM
16:32  zooky: oh x.x
16:32 @ChrisAM: I've never set up a mail server on OS X.. I use postfix on Linux.
16:33 @ChrisAM: But that's just for testing stuff... for my domains, I just use Google Apps... works great with Apple Mail.app
16:35  kamol: google apps works with some delay, but in my case, it is a bit tricky 
16:35  zooky: ChrisAM: google app is nice; but I don't like how they give and take away services freely. I also don't like how google apps syncs passwords from an ldap. 
16:35 @ChrisAM: yeah.. it's not for everyone
16:35  simplicity-: How does google apps sync password from an LDAP? i don't understand.
16:36 @ChrisAM: I've never used it in an ldap/ad environment... I'm not sure.
16:36 @ChrisAM: http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/04/sync-google-apps-user-accounts-with.html
16:37  simplicity-: Sounds clever to me.
16:38  zooky: simplicity-: the idea is you make all your user accounts on your opeendirectory; and then those accounts get pushed out to the various systems. so one account to log into the computer, the share point, the websites, your email. 
16:39  zooky: when you ahve say 50 systems, and 1000+ users. you don't want to enter each user 50 times.
16:39  simplicity-: I get that.
16:40  zooky: simplicity-: google sync dosen't sync passwords. or at least it didn't last time I checked. 
16:42  zer0her0: huh?
16:42  zer0her0: oh
16:42  zer0her0: also, kamol why do you want to run your own email server?
16:42  zer0her0: why not just use google apps or something?
16:48  zooky: simplicity-: oh wait the new vertion supports some password formats. hey that's much better :D
16:51  Snicksie: Is it possible to use a acer/benq s2w 3300u on my mac? I googled for it, couldn't find any drivers or solutions.
16:54  webPragmatist: hey guys why does mac suck so much? i mean last night i closed my laptop with photoshop open and today i had to restart it because it lost it's mind
16:55  jsoft: :|
16:56  webPragmatist: :|
16:56  jsoft: Did you try restarting it? :p
16:56  webPragmatist: can you restart macs?
16:57  Snicksie: sure webPragmatist, apple-sign -> restart... :)
16:57  webPragmatist: that was sarcasm
16:57  zer0her0: webPragmatist: it's a computer, made by humans, you'll run into bugs
16:58  webPragmatist: but i thought if i paid enough money for my laptop i wouldn't get bugs
16:58  webPragmatist: ie mac
16:58  zer0her0: that being said i've had MUCH fewer problems with my Apple machines then I ever had w/ Dell's or my IBM Thinkpads.
16:58  jsoft: Obvious troll is obvious
16:58 * zer0her0 ^5's jsoft
16:58  zer0her0: webPragmatist: if that's the case then ferrari's & mercede's would run close to forever
16:58  webPragmatist: me troll
16:58  webPragmatist: hahaha
16:59  webPragmatist: hobbit maybe
16:59  zer0her0: heh
