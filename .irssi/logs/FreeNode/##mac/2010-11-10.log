08:35  Tomis: there's a 3rd party VNC server that adds in jpeg compression
08:35  Tomis: that's about the best you can do to get better performance from vnc
08:36  Tomis: that's basically what apple did for ARD
08:36  donnib: my problem is the refresh
08:36  donnib: it's horrible
08:36  Tomis: yup
08:36  donnib: actually it's unusable
08:36  Tomis: ca't do much about it
08:36  donnib: when i use ARD at home it works fine
08:36  donnib: but when i disable ARD and enable VNC everything falls apart
08:36 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 106 seconds
08:37  Tomis: sadly there's no windows ARD client, afaik
08:37  donnib: Tomis: so there is no solution
08:37  donnib: Tomis: not that i heard of
08:37  MariusAZ: Try TigerVNC and turn on compression
08:37  MariusAZ: I don't know if Apple's ARD VNC supports compression though
08:37  MariusAZ: If not, then no
08:37  donnib: so install TigerVNC server ?
08:38  MariusAZ: No
08:38  MariusAZ: TigerVNC client
08:38  MariusAZ: 3rd party VNC servers on OS X suck even more than the built in one
08:38  donnib: oh so you mean TigerVNC -> ARD 
08:38  MariusAZ: ARD == VNC
08:39  MariusAZ: With apple's tweaks
08:39  Tomis: ARD is just apple's private extension to VNC
08:39  donnib: i know but i want to know whether i should turn off ARD and enable the standard VNC 
08:39  Tomis: there's no reason to turn it off
08:39  Tomis: leave them both on
08:39  donnib: but you can't 
08:39  donnib: or ?
08:39  Tomis: of course you can
08:40  donnib: i mean you can't turn Screen Sharing on when Remote Desktop is on
08:40  Tomis: yes you can
08:40  donnib: at least i could not last time i tried
08:40  Tomis: it's just a subset of the same functionality anyway
08:40  donnib: but if i understand it correct
08:40  donnib: should i just try right now (i have ARD enabled) and connect to the mac with TightVNC client ?
08:41  Tomis: if you have VNC enabled, sure
08:41  donnib: i have not enabled VNC password if that is req
08:41  iaj: does anyone know whether theres a switch/case statement in applescript?
08:42  Tomis: i wouldn't recommend leaving it blank
08:42  donnib: i only have ARD enabled, don't recall i have changed the Screen Sharing 
08:42  Tomis: i think you need to use an if/else if block iaj 
08:43  donnib: tomis: my problem now is that i don't have access to the machine :( or i have (ARD and SSH) but no Screen Sharing is enabled :(
08:43  Tomis: ARD = Screen Sharing
08:43  iaj: Tomis: thanks :\ that's what I currently built.
08:43  Tomis: i think you're over complicating things donnib 
08:44  donnib: Tomis: probably :)
08:44  Tomis: more percisely, Screen Sharing = a subset of ARD
08:44  Tomis: the Screen Sharing setings are a subset of the Remote Management settings
08:45  donnib: ok, what i can say is that i have network connection to the machine at the moment and i know when i left it that i could connect to it by using ARD, now i don't know if i can connect to it from windows with tightvnc
08:47  Tomis: if you haven't turned on VNC, then you'd need to do so
08:47  donnib: no i have not :(
08:47  Tomis: then turn it on
08:47  donnib: i do have SSH access but i dunno if i can do it from ssh
08:47  MariusAZ: Yeah, you need to turn VNC on on the mac or nothing other than ARD/Screen Sharing will ever get to it
08:47  Tomis: you can enable VNC from the shell
08:47  Tomis: it's messy
08:47  Tomis: google it, i'm sure there's an entry on macosxhints.com for it
08:47  donnib: will do
08:47  donnib: thx

13:15  eagles0513875|2: hey guys how can i get wireshark to run as super user mode 
13:15  eagles0513875|2: im running it via commandline but its saying the app doesnt exists when i try to run it via commandline
13:26  Angostura: eagles0513875|2: How are you trying to run it
13:31  eagles0513875|2: Angostura: just with the default icon in apps
13:32  Angostura: You said you were running it from the commandline
13:32  eagles0513875|2: was trying to 
13:32  eagles0513875|2: sudo wireshark
13:33  Angostura: So the path is probably wrong
13:33  Angostura: You could type sudo and then drag teh app icon to the terminal window
13:34  eagles0513875|2: Jonathan-Aquilinas-MacBook-Pro:~ eagles051387$ /Applications/Wireshark/Wireshark.app 
13:34  eagles0513875|2: -bash: /Applications/Wireshark/Wireshark.app: is a directory
13:35  Angostura: Oh crap, it's presumable a package
13:37  eagles0513875|2: Angostura: if i click on the icon in apps folder it works just fine but i have no interfaces

14:30  eagles0513875|2: Angostura: i realized something after the fact
14:30  eagles0513875|2: wireshark doesnt work with mac
14:31  koro: Why not?
14:31  koro: It's supposed to work.
14:31  rustymyers: I've gotten it to work
14:31  eagles0513875|2: no 
14:31  eagles0513875|2: im saying it doesnt work for sniffing wifi
14:31  eagles0513875|2: im sure it works but im on wifi atm
14:32  Tu13es: it's not designed as a wifi sniffer
14:32  Tu13es: it's designed to show you what's going into/out of your network interfaces
14:32  zok: Is there a way to make the play/pause button (F8)  on my macbook pro NOT start itunes every time it's pressed?
14:33  koro: Tu13es: your wifi card is a network interface
14:33  Tu13es: right
14:33  Tu13es: it'll show you all the packets going to/from that interface
14:33  koro: zok: oh, that problem. There's some little app to do this. Yes, a goddamn app :/
14:34  koro: Tu13es: i.e. "sniffing"
14:34  Tu13es: i'm not saying there's no way to get it to act as a sniffer (i have no idea if it can or not), just that that's not what the program was designed for
14:34  zok: koro: you don't happen to know the name of that app, do you?
14:35  koro: Tu13es: that's the very definition of sniffer
14:35  koro: zok: no, but you'll find it, just do some googlin'
14:35  Tu13es: eagles0513875|2: you probably want kismac
14:35  eagles0513875|2: Tu13es: you mean kismet
14:35  Tu13es: eagles0513875|2: kismac is the mac version
14:35  eagles0513875|2: ahh
14:36  zok: Thanks, koro :)
14:37  Tu13es: wireshark is more of a packet analyzer than a sniffer
14:38  eagles0513875|2: ya
14:38  eagles0513875|2: Tu13es: sniffing as well
14:38  Tu13es: i'm not saying it can't do that
14:38  Tu13es: but it's better at the analysis part
14:38  Tu13es: hence why using kismet to get packets for wireshark is probably the best bet
14:39  koro: Tu13es: sniffer = packet analyzer. give me a break
14:39  koro: it's the same thing
14:39  Tu13es: no, not the same thing
14:39  Tu13es: sniffing just gets you packets
14:39  Tu13es: analyzing tells you stuff about those packets
14:39  koro: analyzing packets requires getting them first
14:39  Tu13es: right
14:39  Tu13es: again, i know wireshark can get packets
14:39  koro: so at the very least wireshark is something *on top* of being a sniffer
14:39  Tu13es: but it's main focus is on the anlysis portion. otherwise it would be able to do everything that kismet could, etc.
14:39  koro: but it most definitely is a sniffer.
14:40  koro: maybe they just don't care about macs?
14:40  Tu13es: i never said it wasn't a sniffer, lol
14:41  koro: 08:34 < Tu13es> i'm not saying there's no way to get it to act as a sniffer (i  have no idea if it can or not),
14:41  koro: so you're saying that you don't know if it can act as a sniffer
14:41  koro: but then you acknowledge that sniffing is required to do what wireshark does
14:41  koro: why don't you just shut up instead of saying random crap
14:42  Tu13es: i said i didn't know if it could act as a wifi sniffer
14:42  Tu13es: i also said it's main purpose is as an analyzer
14:42  eagles0513875|2: Tu13es: i need to analize any traffic coming in on my machine 
14:42  eagles0513875|2: last wednesday i had someone playing a joke or they hacked me
14:42  eagles0513875|2: turning audio on opening apps etc
14:42  Tu13es: i'm not saying random crap
14:42  Tu13es: eagles0513875|2: interesting

14:47  eagles0513875|2: it didnt happen thursday friday monday yestrday
14:47 @Tu13es: hm, strange
14:47  eagles0513875|2: i have a feeling it was a friend of mine in calss doing it someway somehow
14:47 @Tu13es: did you have a guessable/weak password?

14:51  eagles0513875|2: i have disabled the remote IR reciever
14:51  eagles0513875|2: already 
14:51  eagles0513875|2: and had it like that prior to the incident last wednesday
14:52  Angostura: In that case, I'd reinstall the OS from scratch, if it were me. Then update and lock down
14:52  eagles0513875|2: i had done it the sunday before it happened
14:52  Angostura: Make sure that I was running in a non-Admin account for everyday use
14:52  eagles0513875|2: i only have one user 
14:53  eagles0513875|2: jonathan on my pc 
14:53  Angostura: Then make a second
14:53  Angostura: and turn Jonathon into a non-Admin
14:53  eagles0513875|2: ill do that if it happens again hopefully kismac will turn up the ip of anyone trying anything funny
14:54  Angostura: You're assuming that no-one is doing stuff while you've stepped away from the machine for 30 seconds

14:55  eagles0513875|2: i dont im just sayingi leave it locked if i have to leave it alone
14:55  eagles0513875|2: is there a way which AP i am connected to
14:56  Angostura: You leave it locked, and all it takes is for someone to restart and boot from an optical drive
14:56  eagles0513875|2: Angostura: not many people have macs here
14:56  eagles0513875|2: is there a way i can find out the mac address of the accesspoint im connected to?

14:57  eagles0513875|2: if it happens again ill reinstall everything again

16:09  eagles0513875|2: hey guys 
16:09  eagles0513875|2: do the mac laptops that have IR devices use the same IR frequency that the ipod and ipad use and the apple remote use?
16:10  CPng|N: seeing as it's for the apple remote, I'd guess yes
16:10  CPng|N: and last I checked, that "device" is a receiver for the remote, not an emitter
16:10  zer0her0: eagles0513875|2: a few Mac Minis and a few iPads
16:10  eagles0513875|2: and it seems like my mbp 
16:10  zer0her0: eagles0513875|2: IR doesn't use a "
16:10  zer0her0: frequency"
16:10  eagles0513875|2: cuz i think my friend has one 
16:10  zer0her0: IR is InfaRed
16:10  eagles0513875|2: and hes in denial
16:11  eagles0513875|2: cuz i disabled IR and firewalled my alptop
16:11  CPng|N: right. infrared is a certain wavelength
16:11  eagles0513875|2: and its stopped my audio being unmuted etc
16:11  eagles0513875|2: its stopped now
16:11  eagles0513875|2: zer0her0: im talking bout my incident that happened last wednesday
16:11  zer0her0: yea
16:11  eagles0513875|2: i had my laptop unfirewalled and ir enabled and it starteda gain 
16:11  zer0her0: hehe ;)
16:12  CPng|N: "Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength  between 0.7 and 300 micrometres, which equates to a frequency range between approximately 1 and 430 THz.[1]"
16:12  eagles0513875|2: after re enabling firewall and disabling IR it stopped
16:12  eagles0513875|2: O_o terahertz O_o
16:12  zer0her0: eagles0513875|2: i thought you said you didn't have IR on your machine ;)
16:12  eagles0513875|2: but its stopped
16:12  eagles0513875|2: well it seems like i have ir 
16:12  eagles0513875|2: but ther eis no visible reciever
16:12  CPng|N: it seems like you need to stop disabling your firewall too ;)
16:12  eagles0513875|2: haha
16:12  eagles0513875|2: ya
16:13  zer0her0: the isight is your reciever ;)

16:13  zer0her0: yea
16:13  eagles0513875|2: why is the web cam the IR recieverO_o
16:13  CPng|N: that'd be a good location for it on a MB
16:13  eagles0513875|2: mbp
16:13  zer0her0: the webcam can see a broader range then we can see
16:13  CPng|N: it's "magical"
16:13  eagles0513875|2: ahhh
16:13  eagles0513875|2: how can i enable firewall logging
16:15 * zer0her0 sighs

21:00  danl: brb, laundry
21:00  zer0her0: heh ok
21:03  danl: i love having my own place... just need to get interwebs
21:04  zer0her0: danl: congrats, generally you'll need possibly adjust a lense in the tv
21:04  crilly: Angostura: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2664389/Work/Me/Draft_03_081110.jpg
21:04  crilly: I'm not sure about the photo placement
21:04  danl: i figured... i dont know anytig about tht :(
21:05  Angostura: Sorry - not enough contrast between white and blue now IMHO - unreadable
21:11  crilly: Angostura: I agree, but I was looking for feedback on the photo's placement (but not the photo, it's just a stock image I had handy)
21:13  crilly: I can't upload any more drafts as my upstream has died for some reason
21:13  aL3x: does safari already have flash etc built into it? i deleted ALL my internet plugins the other day

21:26  CPng|N: your header
21:26  CPng|N: it's huuuuuuuuuuuuge
21:29  aL3x: i find the header to be condescending and insulting
21:29  danl: Much better
21:29  danl: Colloquy on the iPad os better than iris
21:29  aL3x: "i know the internet can be complicated...blah i learned it so you dont have to" wtf, are you catering to retards
21:30  danl: What part of it is condescending?
21:30  aL3x: you NEVER wanna insult your future clients
21:30  zer0her0: i just punch them in the face instead of shaking their hand
21:30  zer0her0: gets us off on the right foot
21:30  aL3x: if anything, you wanna say "i know you have better things than to deal with this time consuming thing" rather than "you are too dumb to use net"
21:30  torchie: woo ipad
21:31  danl: torchie: It's all i have ATM
21:31  danl: Tethered to my delis
21:31  danl: Erg
21:31  torchie: your delis?
21:31  danl: Droid
21:31  torchie: Dell Droid
21:31  danl: iPad autocomplete for ya ;)
21:31  zer0her0: aL3x: no time you say: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9JUqS4Q2A0
21:31  torchie: The Droid Deli™ only available on Verizon
21:31  danl: Htc incredible actually
21:32  aL3x: and "why not check out my portflio" sounds weak, better to say "click here and check out my portflio"
21:32  zer0her0: yes we're in the 90s "click here" cause people don't know how the web works
21:32  aL3x: when you want people to do something you never ask, you tell
21:32  aL3x: "click here"was a detail...my point is tell dont sugggest/shyly ask
21:33  aL3x: "why not check out my portfolio" should be "check out my portflio"
21:33  torchie: how's the build quality on the incredible
21:33  aL3x: crilly: i am giving you valuable advice here, hope you are paying attention!
21:34  crilly: aL3x: That text isn't final. It's just place holder text.
21:34  aL3x: crilly: i understand...rough draft then
21:34  crilly: very. it'sa total of three hours work on the design, if that
21:35 * zer0her0 sends crilly a bill
21:35  CPng|N: it should be a menu item
21:35  CPng|N: "My Portfolio"
21:35  danl: torchie: Wonderful
21:35  torchie: how many drops?
21:35  zer0her0: it should say "zer0her0 rox0rz your b0xorz"
21:35  aL3x: crilly: it took you 3 hours? and we're supposed to pay YOU for help....HAHAH <---exageration for comic effect
21:36  CPng|N: comic effect requires thick outlines
21:36  crilly: Given that a web design, a good one, takes no less than a week, I'd say it's good going.
21:36  torchie: comic effect requires comic sans MS
21:36  aL3x: oh
21:36  CPng|N: do not use those 2 letters together ever again in this channel
21:36  danl: I'm sleepy... Why did I have to decide to wash all the sheet sets at once?
21:36  zer0her0: danl: you big dumby
21:37  aL3x: danl: lol....ihave done that
21:37  CPng|N: dumby. lol
21:37  torchie: microsoft?
21:37  CPng|N: SHHH
21:37  zer0her0: crilly: i do all my web design in 30 minutes or less
21:37  CPng|N: stop that
21:37  danl: torchie: Dropped calls or how many times have i dropped it?
21:37  torchie: danl: how many times has it fallen from your hand to the pavement and or lava
21:37  danl: torchie: Dozen or so?
21:37  crilly: zer0her0: I can tell ;)
21:37  CPng|N: if you ever drop your phone in a pool of molten lava
21:37  zer0her0: and or lava <-- awesome
21:37  danl: Lava only twice
21:37  CPng|N: just let it go man, cuz man... it's GONE
21:37  aL3x: also the picture doesnt match or complement or cntrast the weblayout
21:37  torchie: NO MAN I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CALL
21:38  zer0her0: actually my friend has going to his prof's old lab where he's making lava
21:38  torchie: that's dedication
21:38  aL3x: i am really beginning to think the internet is more cmplicated for you than for me
21:38  aL3x: and that you need MY services
21:38  crilly: aL3x: Stop commenting. You've not read the entire conversation, obviously, so just stop.
21:38  zer0her0: crilly: you can tell because it's so awesome or so purple?
21:38  torchie: damn
21:38  torchie: aL3x is wreckin schitt here
21:38  crilly: zer0her0: 'cos they look cheap ;)
21:38  aL3x: crilly: i'm attempting to be helpful
21:38  CPng|N: attack, attack
21:38  crilly: And like 30 minute designs
21:38  crilly: ;)
21:39  zer0her0: haha awe, i always thought that was only my makeup
21:39  aL3x: crilly: you posted it, i assumed you wanted feedback...
21:39  crilly: aL3x: I did, but there were conditions on that feedback, such as the text is placeholder text and the image its self is to be ignored because it's a random stock photo I had near by
21:39  aL3x: crilly: ok, i scrolled up...the placement is good
21:40  aL3x: crilly: except it needs some space above it
21:40  aL3x: i think the right side space and top space should be the same
21:41  aL3x: cause curretly, the affect is that thetop of the picture is chopped off
21:41  crilly: aL3x: Hmm, let's give that a try then
21:42  zer0her0: crilly: having not looked at the site, i think there is too much space in the margins, there are not enough references to how awesome i am, and there needs to be more purple.
21:43  aL3x: i think i would also reduce the space to hte right; i still think top and right need to be the same, but i dunno about that thickness...thats something i would have to tinker with until it looked right if it were me...
21:43  zer0her0: oh good suggetion aL3x there should pictures of tinkerbell and cats on the site as well
21:43  zer0her0: (are we design a site? or a song? i forget)
21:44  aL3x: zer0her0: i dunno...all i know is i need a cigarettes
21:44  crilly: zer0her0: lol <3
21:44  zer0her0: cigarrettes are bad
21:44  zer0her0: they make you smell funny
21:44  zer0her0: crilly: <3s
21:44  crilly: aL3x: bare in mind the content is 800px wide... on the average screen resolution, 1024x768, there are 1024 pixels to play in.
21:44  aL3x: crilly: anyway, design wise it looks pretty good, though i would have "quality web servcies" ie the business goal, in gibber font than side notes like "about me" etc
21:45  aL3x: gibber=bigger
21:45  crilly: aL3x: The photo won't seem as though it's squashed against the side
21:45  zer0her0: crilly: actually you get less then 1000, generally 900-980 to work w/
21:45  crilly: aL3x: those fonts are the same 
21:45  zer0her0: due to scroll bars and window dressing.
21:45  aL3x: quality web service is smaller than the links
21:45  aL3x: at least on my browser
21:45  crilly: zer0her0: Still leave 50-90px per side
21:45  zer0her0: crilly: are you sure most of your users are @ 1024? most studies show people at 1280
21:46  zer0her0: we're scrapping our 960 wide design w/ our next revision and going to 1142? or something i think.
21:46  crilly: aL3x: Oh yeah it's smeller because it needs to fit into the height of the 'mcrilly'
21:46  crilly: zer0her0: I'm talking about worse case really, which I'd say is 1024.
21:46  crilly: Anyone still using 1024, however, needs their testicles removing.
21:46  zer0her0: crilly: don't say that in front of danl ;)
21:47  aL3x: crilly: i think the links would be better off smaller, and my reasong is because "quality web service" and mcrilly is like your brand...and it shoudl not be outdone by the link fonts
21:47 * zer0her0 whispers "he's on his ipad"
21:47  aL3x: the more important something is, the bigger it needs to be...size everything in order of importance
21:47  crilly: aL3x: OK, let's give that a try too.
21:47  zer0her0: yep that's why i always make sure to tag poop w/ H1
21:50  aL3x: bbl
21:52  crilly: great, he goes offline aftrer making all those suggestions and me implementing them :/
21:52  zer0her0: hahaha
21:52  danl: She
21:53  crilly: That's what I said, "... she goes ..."
21:53  crilly: You're all wrong! I said SHE!
21:53  Tsavo: I saw she
21:54  CPng|N: fixed width pages--
21:54  crilly: see!
21:55  crilly: spline: The content will be in the center of the page.
21:56  crilly: CPng|N*
21:56 * spline centers the content
21:58  CPng|N: crilly*
22:03  [M]ax: CPng|N you didnt have to kill him off
22:04 * zer0her0 looks at bloody knife in hand, drops it behind the couch
22:04  zer0her0: yea CPng|N did it!
22:05  CPng|N: "digital murder" as the song goes
22:06  zer0her0: heh aight off to teach bbl
22:13  CPng|N: A war of technology 
22:13  CPng|N: Threatens to ignite 
22:13  CPng|N: Digital murder 
22:13  CPng|N: The language of machines
22:20  torchie: but i'm a creep
22:20  torchie: im a weirdo
22:23  CPng|N: this is true
22:23  CPng|N: also, you don't belong here
22:23  CPng|N: that song sounds great on some $2000 speakers

23:05  CPng|N: I see little of value in 10.6.5
23:11  Angostura: CPng|N: Lots of little performance tweaks and bug fixes
23:11  Angostura: all wrapped up in a handy 517Mb package (for me)
