21:04  webPragmatist: how do i get to the remote desktop app for mac
21:05  webPragmatist: or is there one better than chicken of the vnc that supports the apple auth
21:06  aL3x: haha, chicken of the vnc...lol  i had not heard of that
21:08  Brisk: webPragmatist: system/library/coreservices â€¦ or something about like that
21:09  Brisk: ScreenSharing.app, as I recall
21:11  webPragmatist: should i copy it into my applicatoins?
21:14  S_SubZero: if you want vnc you can also do go->connect to server->vnc://whatever
21:18  webPragmatist: ya i did tha
21:18  webPragmatist: that*
21:18  webPragmatist: seems counter intuitive
21:18  webPragmatist: out of curiousity can you make a smart folder just show the contents of a particular folder?
21:22  aL3x: ? huh?
21:22  aL3x: do you mean a smart folder that will display the contents of selected "other" folders, or one that shows items only in itself andhides the others?
21:24 * aL3x wonders if a replacement glass display bezel fr a pro would fit a white  macbook

21:48  zer0her0: well that certainly sucked
21:49  aL3x: zer0her0: what did
21:50  zer0her0: gfx card primary port died on my Mac Pro, it's OOW by 8 months.
21:50  zer0her0: thankfully our dept has extended warranty through 3rd party vendor
21:51  aL3x: ok...then why does anything suck? just dealing with them in general
21:52  zer0her0: spent half a day troubleshooting and getting my macpro into a usable state when I literally have piles of work around me to get done.
21:53  aL3x: work? wth is work.... /me googles
21:56  zer0her0: ?1
21:58  aL3x: it was a joke...ie. pretending not to know what work is....ift hat ?1 is in response to that, cause now i am confused
21:58  zer0her0: ?!
22:03  joaoramos: hi! I've been writing my thesis on a Pages document when all of a sudden instead of one page per on my "workflow", I have pairs of pages, do you know how can I restore my "one page at a time" view back? http://cl.ly/3IUT
22:04  joaoramos: I'm sorry for my bad english.
22:06  aL3x: joaoramos: i dont know for sure. i would assume clicking "view" in the menu bar woudl be a start. i am opening pages and checking though
22:07  joaoramos: I've done that and much more, aL3x :(
22:07  joaoramos: unfortunately I have no idea where this kind of option is :(
22:07  zer0her0: joaoramos: bottom left corner of window where it says percentage click that then select one up
22:07  aL3x: i am looking
22:08  joaoramos: yep, that's it, zer0her0!
22:09  joaoramos: thank you so much both of you, aL3x  and zer0her0 :)
22:09  aL3x: :
22:09  aL3x: :)
22:09  joaoramos: I can keep writing my dissertation again ;)
22:09  zer0her0: joaoramos: ooh oops, i mean it's not there
22:09  zer0her0: ;)
22:10  joaoramos: aha ;)
22:11  Tsavo: I've seen this before but I can't resolve it this time: http://midspin.webhop.net/volume.jpg
22:11  Tsavo: am i forgetting something obvious to do so that the keyboard volume buttons work?
22:13  zer0her0: Tsavo: what machine?
22:13  Tsavo: Macbook with a seperate keyboard
22:13  zer0her0: and what's your output? generally you get that if it's using and/or thinks it's using optical output.
22:13  zer0her0: also software all up to day?
22:13  zer0her0: date*
22:13  Tsavo: if it thinks it does
22:13  Tsavo: lemme wobble the knobble
22:13  Tsavo: I have 10.4.11
22:14  aL3x: ack
22:14  Tsavo: So it's up to date as far as Tiger goes
22:14  zer0her0: which keyboard are you using?
22:14  Tsavo: the new one w/ the number pad. it's suddenly not working
22:14  aL3x: did you try rebooting
22:14  Tsavo: it normally does, is what I mean
22:14  joaoramos: hey zer0her0, one more question: have you tried to "shrink" the pages in Pages (redundancy lol) and see what happens to the Table of Contents #s?
22:14  joaoramos: I mean, shrink through the rulers.
22:15  Tsavo: I guess I could try restarting :/
22:15  Tsavo: it's not that big of a deal for now though
22:15  zer0her0: joaoramos: i haven't i also don't do much desktop publishing/writing in a word doc
22:15  aL3x: anytime stuff acts weird, and othng works, restarting is a good idea
22:15  aL3x: nothing*
22:15  zer0her0: Tsavo: apple menu->system prefs->sound->output
22:15  zer0her0: what's it set to?
22:15  Tsavo: I can change it via that zer0her0 
22:16  zer0her0: Tsavo: so it says speakers there?
22:16  Tsavo: the volume is locked via the keyboard whether there is anything in the output jack or not
22:19  zer0her0: Tsavo: i'd try to see if there are any software updates
22:19  Tsavo: checking now
22:20  aL3x: have you tried unplugging hte kb and using  a mouseto up hte volume
22:20  aL3x: the*
22:20  jff40: hi i just wanted to know if there is a test edition of mac os x is?
22:20  aL3x: also, you have a separate kb...why? is your built in kb damaged? if so that could add to the issues
22:20  aL3x: jff40: you mean like a trial? no
22:20  zer0her0: joaoramos: um huh?
22:21  zer0her0: yea it's called an apple store
22:21  jff40: mist
22:21  aL3x: jff40: go to best buy or an apple store, and play on some machnes there
22:21  aL3x: zer0her0: you stole my idea
22:21  aL3x: :P
22:21  zer0her0: mist?!
22:22  Tsavo: aL3x: i have an external keyboard bc i usually keep my macbook closed connected to an external moniter
22:22  Tsavo: and i've tried disconnecting/reconnecting everything so
22:22 * Tsavo shrugs
22:22  Tsavo: Restarting is a hassle for me so i'll just wait until i /need/ to restart
22:22  Tsavo: my speakers have volume controls
22:22  Tsavo: m'out
22:23  aL3x: restarting is often all it takes to fix something
22:23  aL3x: if you havent even restarted, it's pointless trying to troubleshoot
22:24  Tsavo: also apple remote doesn't work
22:24  Tsavo: oh well lol
22:24  Tsavo: bye
22:24  aL3x: i think these fall under the category of "need" to reboot
22:25  zer0her0: well day is done
