01:30  carter_: i asked the same question in the macosx channel and no one seemed to respond. 
01:30  carter_: can i repartition an external with Disk Utility that has a master boot record partition scheme without erasing the data that is already on it?
01:32 @ChrisAM: doubt it
01:33  Kasm279: carter_: nope
01:33  Kasm279: well
01:33  Kasm279: not with OSX
01:33  Kasm279: you could use a windows computer and partition majic
01:33  Kasm279: magic*
01:33  carter_: damn...because i know you can if it has another partition scheme
01:34  Kasm279: yeah, GUID iirc
01:34  carter_: GUID iirc?
01:36  Kasm279: iirc = if i recal correctly
01:36  Kasm279: recall*
01:36  Kasm279: pretty sure its GUID
01:36  carter_: oh right...
01:37  carter_: and i'm guessing you can't change the partition scheme without erasing
01:37  carter_: dang.

18:33  alexbobP: 06:26:29 ##mac: < barfster> alexbobP: The nicotine is what gives you a buzz/delight, the additives are made to realy get you hooked.
18:34  alexbobP: barfster: are you effing kidding me?  nicotine is what gets you hooked
18:34  alexbobP: barfster: the only "additive" that helps get you hooked is the fact that they add more nicotine than the plant actually produces
18:34  alexbobP: nicotine is an addictive substance
18:34  alexbobP: that's why people use nicotine patches and whatnot to get off of tobacco
18:35  barfster: nicotine changes the size speed that your blood is travelling through your body.
18:35  barfster: nicotine changes the size of the veins in turn the speed that your blood is travelling through your body.
18:36  barfster: the additives are sugar, cocoa and others that are known to make people addicted.
18:36  barfster: The biggest problem in the world’s diet of today is sugar, and sweets
18:37  barfster: nicotine only gives a feeling of sensation of some sort.
18:37  alexbobP: so your claim is that people get hooked on cigarettes because they put sugar in them.
18:37  alexbobP: seriously?
18:37  barfster: No
18:37  alexbobP: that's what you're saying... suguar, cocoa, etc...
18:37  barfster: I claim that people who are smoking cigarettes have half the chance of quitting compared to those who only smoke rolling tobacco
18:38  alexbobP: ...
18:38  alexbobP: ridiculous
18:39  barfster: mixture abuse is alot heavier to cope with that the abuse of a single substance
18:39  barfster: for example at McDonald’s even the salads contain sugar additives.
18:39  barfster: benzo + alcohol is the most fatal combination
18:40  alexbobP: so how come if I take the nicotine out of a cigarette (by roasting it lightly with a lighter before smoking), it doesn't satisfy any of a smoker's cravings?
18:40  alexbobP: I tried that once with an addicted tobacco smoker
