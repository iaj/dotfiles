03:29  richardcavell: old one's battery is dying
03:29  richardcavell: (again)
03:29 +Tomis: google "mac buyers guide" and "mac price guide"
03:29  richardcavell: In Australia I only have so many options
03:29 +Tomis: i doubt there are any big changes coming to the 15 and 17, but it can't hurt to hold off for a couple months just to see
03:29  richardcavell: no discounts
03:30  richardcavell: I'm thinking 13" MBP
03:31  richardcavell: Why should I buy the Pro over the non-Pro?
03:31  richardcavell: I want 4 Gigs of RAM
03:31  richardcavell: Cos I just do
03:33  richardcavell: What's the MacBook Air keyboard like?
03:33  richardcavell: Can I use it to type documents?
03:35 +Tomis: of course
03:35  richardcavell: I'll have to see it for real
03:35  richardcavell: A lot of these netbooks have shitty keyboards
03:37  Swian: I got my wife an iPad for Xmas
03:38  Swian: and my netbook keyboard is ok
03:38  Swian: a little small but good action
03:38  Swian: the trackpad is crap tho
03:38  richardcavell: is it a MacBook Air?
03:38  Swian: no, its a netbook
03:39  richardcavell: ok
03:39  Swian: meets my needs for what its for
03:39  S_SubZero: I believe the Macbook <everything> use the same keyboard.
03:41  richardcavell: How's the SSD storage?
03:41  richardcavell: Fast?  Reliable?
03:42  S_SubZero: "no, it's very slow and utterly unrelia.."
03:43  ae86-drifter: S_SubZero: Wha....???
03:43  ae86-drifter: i wouldn't call it slow..
03:43  S_SubZero: would you call it sarcasm? 8P
03:44  ae86-drifter: thought so, just making sure ... 
03:44  ae86-drifter: lol
03:44  ae86-drifter: the new mba got awesome reviews, apparently it's almost as fast as mbp...
03:44  ae86-drifter: i used one for about 5 mins
03:44  ae86-drifter: they boot up quick
03:45  richardcavell: The processor is 1.4 Gigahertz
03:46  ae86-drifter: but u can get the 1.6 GHz if you want to pay a bit more
03:46  ae86-drifter: + ssd
03:46  ae86-drifter: makes it pretty fast
03:46  ae86-drifter: 4 gb ram
03:47  richardcavell: I want 4 gig
03:47  richardcavell: Jesus Apple charges for it
03:47  ae86-drifter: except the screen is alot weaker than the last macbook air
03:47  Swian: yep
03:48  richardcavell: They're probably using the same dirt cheap parts that everyone else uses
03:48  Swian: nope
03:48  ae86-drifter: its soft instead of hard
03:48  Swian: in my experience apple used better hardware
03:48  ae86-drifter: they used a weaker screen in order to keep it thin
03:49  richardcavell: When you say 'weaker', you mean it can crack?
03:49  Swian: could be true, but that's a design choice
03:49  ae86-drifter: it doesn't have the perspex/glass or whatever on it anymore
03:49  Swian: I don't really need a laptop other than my netbook
03:49  ae86-drifter: well a guy i work with seriously bumped it with his elbow and the whole thing cracked
03:50  Swian: lame
03:50  Swian: the iPad seems nice, my wife loves it
03:50  ae86-drifter: i was so close to getting one until i heard about that
03:50  richardcavell: I don't think you can use the iPad for serious word processing though
03:50  ae86-drifter: thats my only concern
03:50  richardcavell: I write technical documents
03:50  Swian: she has a mini for that
03:51  S_SubZero: Apple themselves says the iPad is for looking at information.  Not information creation.
03:51  Swian: its not a laptop or desktop replacement
03:51  Swian: it is what it is
03:52  Swian: my wife uses it all over the house for web browsing, email, chat, netflix
03:52  GoogleFreak: might as well get the mac book air
03:52  Swian: I wouldn't want one, but hey, its not for me
03:52  Swian: how much is that
03:53  Swian: the iPad wasn't too bad
03:53  richardcavell: Are they going to introduce something bigger than the iPad?
03:53  richardcavell: The iSlate?
03:53  GoogleFreak: i'm happy with my ipod touch
03:53  Swian: I'm happy with my mac mini, dual boot PC and netbook
03:54  GoogleFreak: i don't use my pc that much anymore 
03:54  Swian: I don't either, but I do need it
03:54  GoogleFreak: i'll probably get the mac mini for my next mac
03:54  Swian: for working from home and gaming

03:57  richardcavell: It's funny cos it's true
03:57  iaj: hey there
03:57  richardcavell: If Apple made an overpriced pencil box, people would line up to buy it
03:58  iaj: is there any way to send a mail in my mail.app's draft folder @ a specified time?
04:00  Swian: good question, that could be useful
04:00  Swian: not that I use mail, I like thunderbird
04:02  ae86-drifter: "When you open up the hinged upper lid, the iBox interior is filled with 29 different graphic art tools, each of which responds to a variety of hand movements. The interfaces are fairly intuitive, with a variety of mark-making potential."
04:02  iaj: ahhh found something :) in mail scripts
04:02  ae86-drifter: applescript could do that
04:03  Swian: also a thunderbird add on that can

04:31  Swian: I have very little pain
04:31  GoogleFreak: yes
04:31  GoogleFreak: because meat is the most acidic
04:32  GoogleFreak: cooked meat anyways
04:32  ae86-drifter: raw salmon is good
04:32  Swian: I don't know about the acid, but read a nice piece about fat storing in your cells not matter HOW lean the meat
04:32  ae86-drifter: and berries
04:32  Swian: and that fat was the worst for RA
04:32  Swian: don't like salmon, but raw tuna, sign me up

07:39 +remyo: I like the idea of Chrome OS

07:40 +remyo: I started dating again. And it's meant I'm behind on work too. So I haven't gotten around to following any tech news
07:40  LaraX: but then I saw other people talking about it

12:31  eroomde: hi. I've a bunch of individual pdf files. how can i merge them into one document?
12:31  raluxgaza: Suggestions please: Which to get macbook classic or mac air 11" for rails development and vm?
12:32  raluxgaza: anyone with experiences using both
12:32  eroomde: raluxgaza: vm's are bottlenecked mainly by disk io speed rather than cpu (ram helps either way). So something with an ssd will show advantages, assuming you don't want to use an external disk
12:33  eroomde: and the air 11" has i beleive a higher resolution than the 13 inch macbook (stupid I know!) and i'm in the higher resolution = better camp
12:34  raluxgaza: eroomde: How about they keyboard comfort level for all day typing
12:34  Kasm279: raluxgaza: should be about the same
12:34  Kasm279: oh
12:34  Kasm279: 11" MBA
12:35  eroomde: eroomde: I think they'd be probabl the same. I get rsi so I hate laptop keyboards and avoid trying to do extended typing at them
12:35  eroomde: I have a kinesis freestyle external which i use when i'm going to be typing for a while
12:35  eroomde: not really portable though!
12:36  raluxgaza: yea, typing is vital important to me cos of wrist problems
12:36  raluxgaza: also size is :D
12:36  theworkpatrol: 11.6", 1366 × 768
12:36  theworkpatrol: 13.3", 1440 × 900
12:36  theworkpatrol: those are the resolutions
12:36  theworkpatrol: for the mba
12:36  raluxgaza: theworkpatrol: okay thanks
12:36  raluxgaza: 1366 x 768 is not bad
12:36  eroomde: but the 13"mbp I beleive is less than the 11.6 mba?
12:36  raluxgaza: it's the standard these days anyways
12:36  eroomde: which I could not really understand
12:37  theworkpatrol: the 13" mbp starts at 1199 and the 11" mba starts at 999
12:37  raluxgaza: yea, quite the price difference 
12:37  theworkpatrol: with the 11" mba you lose physical size, optical media support, and some ports
12:37  eroomde: raluxgaza: yeah I got really bad wrists all of a sudden. never had a problem with rsi, thought i was a fit and healthy and sport 22 year old. then suddenly whilst typing my thesis i was in agony
12:38  raluxgaza: i get student discount, and it's either the mba 11 or mb classic
12:38  raluxgaza: as they are the same price
12:38  eroomde: i'd go for the 11 mba
12:38  theworkpatrol: get the mba
12:38  theworkpatrol: the aluminum alone makes it a better deal
12:38  raluxgaza: eroomde: yea I know how you feel, it's a real pain
12:38  theworkpatrol: there is no way i'd run a plastic mac when i could have a metal one
12:39  raluxgaza: theworkpatrol: get analysis and recommendation
12:39  raluxgaza: **good
12:39  raluxgaza: thanks guys
12:39  theworkpatrol: i could elaborate but honestly, the key difference is in the unit's construction and i htink the mba has the mb beat hands down
12:39  theworkpatrol: th*
12:39  eroomde: raluxgaza: no problem. but consider this a vote for getting a good external keyboard too!
12:40  eroomde: just for the odd typing binge
12:40  raluxgaza: eroomde: yea, however carrying an external keyboard everywhere is not practical for me as i work remotely most of the time
12:40  theworkpatrol: the 11" mba keys are surprisingly comfortable. i would only recommend a bigger screen for home use.
12:42  raluxgaza: Yea, i'll go with the mba 11
12:42  raluxgaza: with a larger flash
12:42  eroomde: theworkpatrol: that's good too (if only so your neck isn;t bent down) but it'll still a bit bad to use such a small keyboard long term. the issue for me was having to bend by wrists inwards
12:42  eroomde: that caused the carpal tunnel
12:43  eroomde: whereas a more split keyboard really helped the problem go away. but then it affects differen people differently!
12:48  eroomde: raluxgaza: OOI, what is the edu discount price on an mba?
12:48  shuaib: mba guys?
12:48  shuaib: I know of mbp, what's an mba?
12:48  eroomde: (I am about to start a uni research job in jan, my mbp is 4.5 years old now, you follow my thinking!)
12:48  eroomde: air
12:48  shuaib: Oh, right! :P
12:49  AlecTaylor: hi
12:50  shuaib: I wouldn't go for an mba without owning an mbp first. But then I am a developer, with need for slightly more power then what mba has to offer
12:50  AlecTaylor: Which Mac Operating Systems have built in read-only NTFS support, and which have built-in read/write NTFS support? - The reason I ask is the person who's harddrive I'm formatting may not have MacFuse with NTFS-3g installed...
12:51  veovis_muaddib: shuaib: To be honest I wouldn't keep a macbook air that was gifted to me.  I'd sell it and buy a windows/linux desktop.  And I'm speaking to you from a mbp
12:51  eroomde: shuaib: yeah that's what I'm having to figure out at the moment
12:51  veovis_muaddib: AlecTaylor: None
12:51  veovis_muaddib: AlecTaylor: They all have read only.  The read write is not stable
12:51  raluxgaza: eroomde: £797
12:51  eroomde: there's plenty of heavy linux metal on racks in our lab so I might just move to using an mba as a client to running jobs on the racks
12:52  eroomde: raluxgaza: ah good, i'm in that currency too
12:52  raluxgaza: eroomde: ;)
12:52  veovis_muaddib: AlecTaylor: Snow Leopard can have read/write support with a terminal command, but it's corrupted several hard drives for me
12:52  veovis_muaddib: Paragon is the way to go for fast NTFS, and NTFS-3G is the way to go for cheap NTFS
12:53  veovis_muaddib: *free, not cheap
12:53  shuaib: eroomde, it all comes down to your need, if what you are mostly going to be using it for is surfing web, and writing docs, then by all means mba would be a good choice.
12:54  AlecTaylor: veovis_muaddib: What's the earlies Mac OS version that supported read-only NTFS?
12:54  veovis_muaddib: AlecTaylor: I know Leopard did.  I'm not sure about Tiger, sorry
12:55  veovis_muaddib: And before that, you'd have to look
12:56  AlecTaylor: look?
12:56  veovis_muaddib: Google
12:56  AlecTaylor: ...
12:56  eroomde: shuaib: i'm a reseracher into statistical signal processing, so actually all my life i run very computationally heavy problems like MCMC and simulated annealing. but they're so heavy weight that actually trying to run them on anything other than a big heavy box or cluster probably doesn't make much sense
12:56  eroomde: unless i'm just debugging on a tiny test case
12:57  shuaib: eroomde, I think mba is for you then :)
12:57  eroomde: hence my thinking that an mba might make a nice client on which to develop and shell into the big boxes
12:57  veovis_muaddib: eroomde: Do you start them through screen/alternative or vnc/rdp or what?
12:57  eroomde: veovis_muaddib: usually screen
12:57  eroomde: i like screen
12:57  veovis_muaddib: Oh yeah
12:58  veovis_muaddib: Do you know about Visor?
12:58  eroomde: i did a little dance when a friend introduced me to it. no more messing around with 'bg, 'fg' and '&'
12:58  eroomde: not heard of it I'm afriad - do you have  alink?
12:58  eroomde: oh wat i do
12:58  eroomde: the quicksilver people right?
12:58  veovis_muaddib: I believe so
12:58  eroomde: drop-down term
12:58  veovis_muaddib: Yeah
12:59  veovis_muaddib: It's great for when you want quick access to ssh and such
12:59  eroomde: yeah i used it for a while but never re-installed it after my snow leopard upgrade. i probably should, it was good
12:59  veovis_muaddib: I can bring it down while watching videos with VLC, restart a server, and be watching my movie the whole time
13:00  veovis_muaddib: Yeah, I've been trying to find a linux alternative for awhile, but haven't found one I like.
13:01  eroomde: yeah. as bad as it is to say, i'm only staying with osx for the little things, like i just plugged in my random junk printer scanner to scan a pdf letting agreement for my new flat, and was able to drag the individual scanned sheet pdf's into a new preview.app window to make one big pdf. the little things like that are what i think i'd miss if i went to linux full time
13:01  eroomde: but for my 'job' i'd rather have a linux machine (with a decent package manager!!)
13:07  eroomde: well anyhoo, god luck with your degree raluxgaza 
13:08  raluxgaza: eroomde: cheers mate, it's a post-grad, all the best to you too
13:09  eagles0513875: anyone able to help me with some wifi printer issue :( 
13:09  eagles0513875: its really pissing me off 
13:10  eroomde: raluxgaza: ok cool. we're in the same boat then. have fun!
13:10  eroomde: see y'all

17:22  neverblue: is this a support channel ?
17:23  neverblue: sorry, ill assume it is
17:24  neverblue: is there a keyboard shortcut that brings up a (similar to Windows-right-click) context menu, for performing actions with a selection ?
17:24 @ChrisAM: good question
17:26 @ChrisAM: you can enable mouse keys
17:26  neverblue: could you give me a URL on doing this?
17:26  neverblue: please :D
17:26 --- b0o-yeah_ is now known as b0o-yeah
17:27 @ChrisAM: it's under universal access
17:28  neverblue: right, but I am new to Macs and I am unsure what you mean up enable mouse keys
17:28  fujisan: l'explication﻿ c'est: "ignorier mich nich" ^^﻿
17:28 @ChrisAM: go to System Preferences and then Universal Access
17:28  neverblue: for example, are you implying I can activate the mouse's right click ?
17:29  neverblue: which, when clicked, performs similarly to a Windows-right-click 
17:29  fujisan: is a logout-login just as beneficial as a reboot? 
17:29 @ChrisAM: do you want to be able to right-click from the mouse, or do you want the context menu to appear when you press something on the keyboard?
17:30  neverblue: fujisan, some services will not be restarted on a logout
17:30  fujisan: hmz okay
17:30 @ChrisAM: fujisan ... depends on what you're trying to do
17:30  fujisan: my system has been up for 4 days so do i need a reboot?
17:30  neverblue: ChrisAM, my original question was pertaining to the keyboard
17:30 @ChrisAM: If i's a kerne update, you have to reboot.
17:30  neverblue: fujisan, why would you 'need' a reboot is the important question
17:31  fujisan: ChrisAM:  i just read somewhere that you need to boot at least once a day to keeps things running smooth
17:31  neverblue: fujisan, could you supply the URL/resourse where you read this ?
17:31 @ChrisAM: fujisan ... for Windows maybe.
17:31  fujisan: neverblue:  i think i read it in the macfan magazine
17:31  fujisan: which is a dutch magazine for macusers
17:32  neverblue: gotcha
17:32  fujisan: but i am paraphrasing here most likely
17:32 @ChrisAM: I don't notice any performance problems with not rebooting.
17:32  fujisan: hmz ok
17:33 @ChrisAM: neverblue ... you can enable right-click with the mouse with Mouse preferences... you can enable the context menu from the keyboard by enabling Mouse Keys within the Universal Access preferences.
17:34  fujisan: neverblue:  the magazine did have a really nice issue about anaglyph stereoscopic 3D
17:34  neverblue: fujisan, :D
17:34  fujisan: and included some red-blue carton goggles and a picture of a lion which was really good

17:50  neverblue: how can I send a magic packet to wake my sleeping mac from my windows station

18:00  fujisan: well when i play these games it's for a number of hours

18:10  Angostura: AnthonyCat: Root is disabled by default on OS X. If you enable it, you have to set a password
18:13  AnthonyCat: Angostura: what does it mean for it to be disabled, because I can be root
18:14  Angostura: What do you mean? If you are logging in as user 'Root' then clearly it has been enabled
18:14  Angostura: If you are merely sudoing, then no, you're not root

21:52  osxdude: so my Mac locks up when a CD that shakes a lot is in the drive
21:52  osxdude: and said CD is spinning
21:52  osxdude: ..
21:52  osxdude: eagles0513875: I know somethings about logic
21:52  osxdude: not an expert
21:53  eagles0513875: osxdude: how do i set it when im recording to keep movign along the measures and automatically detect the type of note instead of using the one i have clicked when recording in the score
21:54  eagles0513875: osxdude: guessing you have no idea
21:54  osxdude: well, score is based on note length and position, although from personal experience...
21:55  eagles0513875: which do you prefer using 
21:55  eagles0513875: the score or
21:55  osxdude: piano roll
21:55  eagles0513875: it behaves the same as if im using the score though
21:55  osxdude: what do you mean?
21:56  osxdude: I mean like
21:56  osxdude: Piano roll gives you much finer control
21:56  eagles0513875: the notes out putted are 16th notes which is not the rhythm im playing

21:57  osxdude: ok
21:57  eagles0513875: i dunno what i should google for
21:57  osxdude: well I don't have much experience with the score; last time I tried to write on the score, it was a hellish experience, lol
21:58  eagles0513875: osxdude: what version of logic studio
