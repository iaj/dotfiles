20:57  Phrogz_: Repeat: MacBook trackpad, turning on the setting for "one finger dragging" without "drag lock" now has a pause between when the finger comes up and the drag is released. Anyone know of a hack to remove this delay and get the old "the moment the finger is up the drag is over" behavior?
21:01  thelostpatrol: that's supposed to happen in case you get to the end of the trackpad with your finger and still need to drag. the pause allows you time to get your finger back on the pad someplace else and keep dragging without losing the file.

21:47 * Phrogz_ accepts that the dragging delay is inherent in the driver and cannot be overridden, and just turns off one finger dragging.

22:19  anr78: I'm looking for a download manager that let's me add downloads from common filehosts to a queue. jdownloader does the job but hasnÂ´t got the os x feel to it.
22:21 @ChrisAM: tried iGetter?
22:22 @ChrisAM: or SpeedDownload
22:22 * aL3x uses "not too lazy to google apps manually"
22:23 @ChrisAM: we can do it for you
22:23 @ChrisAM: !g os x download manager

22:49  Citrus: My mac pro wont start up. I am getting a cpu A & B overtemp led light up on my motherboard
22:49  Citrus: how can I fix it?
22:50 +LaraX: do any of you know much about Android phones? what do you think of EVO vs Epic? I might get one
23:02 @crilly: LaraX: Android is a Linux based mobile OS. My view is simply this: Linux needs to stay in server land. It has no place in any environment where the user directly interacts with its UI for everyday use, and important everyday use at that.
23:02 @crilly: brb
23:03  crilly: Just updating the IRC client.

23:21  gucko: hi people
23:22  Citrus: I have the HTC Evo and absolutely love it
23:22 @crilly: Hi gucko 
23:22  Citrus: You cant beat Sprint's data plan
23:22  b3ny0-: I like the HTC hardware
23:22 @crilly: Citrus: I've never actually seen it. I'll look it up. Lara has disconnected though.
23:22  b3ny0-: but I don't want wm/android
23:23 @crilly: b3ny0-: I wouldn't mind giving the latest WM version a try, see what it's like.
23:23  b3ny0-: perhaps try it
23:23  b3ny0-: I had a wm6 phone once
23:23  b3ny0-: had it one day, then sold it
23:23  b3ny0-: :P
23:24 @crilly: ;p
23:24  gucko: How luck you are guys! I wanna buy a MBP and it's totally not the best time to buy it, since new ones could be released soon :(
23:24  gucko: *lucky
23:24  fujisano: gucko: 
23:24  fujisano: :<
23:24  b3ny0-: I bought mine a few months ago
23:25  b3ny0-: be glad you get the new faster ones :P
23:25  gucko: but I have to wait :(
23:25  b3ny0-: your entire life is waiting for stuff
23:25  b3ny0-: better get used to it
23:25  b3ny0-: :P
23:25  gucko: :)
23:26 @crilly: Got mine a year ago.
23:26  b3ny0-: I didn't think I would like OSX that much
23:26  gucko: b3ny0-: why?
23:26  b3ny0-: a few years ago when I used it in a hired studio I really didn't like it
23:26  gucko: b3ny0-: what did you use before OSX?
23:27  b3ny0-: windows since 94, before that Atari OS
23:27  gucko: lol
23:27  gucko: b3ny0-: you preferred Windows over OSX?!
23:27 @crilly: I did too, for a long while.
23:27  b3ny0-: back then I did yes
23:28  gucko: and the reasons?!
23:28  b3ny0-: this was around 07-08
23:28 @crilly: All I knew about Macs was single-button mice and an odd, funny OS.
23:28  b3ny0-: I knew it a lot better
23:28  Citrus: anyone know if there is a quick fix for m Mac Pro. The CPU overtemp LEDs for both CPUs are going off after a few seconds
23:28  b3ny0-: and yes, windows CAN work without mishaps of any larger kind ;)
23:28  b3ny0-: its up to the user
23:29 @crilly: Citrus: I wouldn't turn it on again, that's for sure. I would also check the cooling system, as it sounds something is failing with it.
23:29  b3ny0-: the biggest reason back then was probably because I got nuts of the perephirals to the MAc
23:29  b3ny0-: and that I played a lot of games on my computer
23:29 @crilly: Yeah I played games too.
23:29  gucko: b3ny0-: what's your main work now on OSX?
23:30  b3ny0-: everyday tasks mostly, and music production
23:30  b3ny0-: main reason I got it was to have a dependable laptop for live performances
23:30  b3ny0-: and also produce when travelling
23:32  b3ny0-: basically what's made me favor OSX now is 80% owed to the trackpad
23:32  gucko: yeah I love it too. So practical
23:32  b3ny0-: the multitouch implentation is just what laptops needed, never liked laptops until now
23:33  b3ny0-: for desktop I still prefer windows though, I still play quite a lot of games and a console won't cut it for me
23:35  Citrus: How do I find the thermal sensor on my Mac Pro? it isnt listed in the service manual
