02:05  netdaemon: unless you turned on the firewall, it is open

02:07  torchie: like a notification led type dealie
02:07  netdaemon: a vibration every so often, or a ding if you have sound on
02:07  netdaemon: no LED though
02:09  torchie: so it keeps vibrating and dinging even after the notification arrives?
02:09  netdaemon: yes
02:09  netdaemon: vibrating and dinging, or just vibrating, depending on your settings and if you have it on silent
02:10  torchie: does the ipad vibrate
02:10  netdaemon: i have no clue on that one
02:10  netdaemon: lol
02:10  netdaemon: i have an iPhone 3GS

17:38  pgpkeys: this rocks, just found out my aunt sent me down a walmart card so i can get a kindle 2 from there! niiiice
17:38  pgpkeys: now hopefully it will allow oyu to view PDFs on it and not just .mobi or .epub books
17:38  pgpkeys: s/oyu/you/g
17:38 +LaraX: I'm just saying you have a Mac, so you don't have to deal with Vista... and if you're not even going to use this yourself, maybe you don't want it as much as I do...

17:39 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: it can view PDFs yes, you'll want to pull your hair out when you do view PDFs on it though

17:40  pgpkeys: yeah
17:41 +LaraX: zer0her0: well at least all black, or something different. like I love how the Cr-48 looks, all black and especially that rubberized coating... maybe they'll even use carbon fiber one day, or something interesting
17:41 +LaraX: they = Apple
17:41 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: that would be news to me as far as i'm aware you have to do the conversion on the desktop
17:41 +LaraX: (or Google)
17:42  pgpkeys: zer0her0: well so long as calibre works on the conversions i'll be happy
17:42 +zer0her0: LaraX: how recyclable is carbon fiber? that's why apple went from titanium to aluminum 
17:42 +zer0her0: pgpkeys: that it does
17:43 +zer0her0: i need to sit down and work on the UI fir calibre, it's so aweful
17:43 +LaraX: zer0her0: I'm not sure other than it's black and lighter than aluminum, but good question
