00:35  Branes: I'm not trolling; I'm passionate about interface, and I am firmly convinced that it is the neanderthals and their love of the commandline that is deliberately holding back advancement in computer interaction.
00:36  Cam: Branes; How do I delete every mp3 in "downloads" with finder? Amaze me.
00:36  gnormandin: Branes: I'm all for advancement... so long as it makes my life easier or accelerates my current tasks
00:36  Cam: ^
00:36  gnormandin: ie... it need to IMPROVE my workflow
00:36  gnormandin: not simply alter it
00:36 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 88 seconds
00:36  gnormandin: *THAT* is why
00:36  Branes: Getting rid of the requirement to learn another language is the ultimate improvement.
00:36  gnormandin: introduce a new input paradigm that improves and accelerates what I do.. and I'll drop my terminal
00:37  Branes: They already did, in 1983, it's called the GUI.
00:37  gnormandin: until then, I dont think you even have an arguement
00:37  Cam: Branes; It's not easier!
00:37  Cam: I /cannot/ do what I want with it.
00:37  Kasm279: blargh wtf
00:37  Kasm279: explorer just randomly froze -_-
00:37  Branes: And the only real advancement in interface paradigms since 1983 can be attributed to one mane, John Underkoffler.
00:37  Branes: Everything else has just been marking time, treading water.
00:37  Kasm279: name*
00:37  londonmet050: what's up guys
00:37  Branes: They commandline must die.
00:38  Branes: -y
00:38  londonmet050: any thing exciting
00:38  gnormandin: Branes: please, instead of complaining, make it better
00:38  Cam: Branes; How do I?
00:38  Branes: I've already told you how to make using a computer better - stop using the commandline.
00:38  Cam: NO.
00:38  Cam: How do I delete every .mp3 file in my directoy?
00:39  Cam: -y+ry
00:39  londonmet050: lol
00:39  gnormandin: Branes: stopping a current task is bnot better, it's reducing productivity
00:39  londonmet050: stop using command line
00:39  Branes: Open the folder, sort by kind, drag over everything that's an mp3, drag to the trash. Requires no thought, no memorising of an arcane, nonsyntactical written language with no relevance or bearing on the real world.
00:39  nostar: anyone understan dyld?
00:40  Cam: Branes; or rm /path/to/*.mp3
00:40  Branes: Which makes no sense to a human.
00:40  Cam: That is 100000000 times faster.
00:40  Cam: Branes; it shows that to those that know it, the commandline > gui
00:40  Cam: Unless the gui can do what I do with the commandline: I will not alter.
00:40  Kasm279: why don't all three of you just stop
00:40  Branes: "Teach computers how humans work. Never teach humans how computers work, because they lose their humanity and become machines." -- Alan Kay, Xerox PARC 1983.
00:41  Kasm279: you can't make Branes alter his opinion
00:41  Kasm279: Branes can't make you other two alter your opinions
00:41  Cam: Kasm279; I can proove that he should consider what I am saying.
00:41  Cam: I agree! GUI IS  the way to go!
00:41  Cam: But not right now.. right now it /sucks/
00:41  Branes: This addiction to ancient history is another infuriating example of blinding stupidity.
00:41  Kasm279: it won't change anything :P
00:41  Cam: Branes; the gui has no power.
00:42  Branes: Cam, you are completely and totally wrong.
00:42  Branes: Utterly.
00:42  Cam: Nope.
00:42  Cam: My sister gave me 1000 songs and wanted me to remove the m4a's
00:42  Kasm279: both of you, stop
00:42  Cam: Unless finder makes that easy..
00:42  Cam: TERMINAL.
00:42  gnormandin: Branes: look... ideally, you are completely correct
00:42  Branes: I spent twelve years at the prompt and was good at it. Later I spent three years teaching infants like you, who thought they knew better, how to design interface paradigms and instill some semblance of sense.
00:42  gnormandin: and conceptually, you are correct
00:42  nostar: I installed xcode, then overwrote a lib libiconv from source and broke it, so i re installed xcode and it fixed the broken lib, except if i log in over ssh for example i still get dyld errors even though i get no more errors with the same user on a local terminal.  some kind of cache thing or something
00:43  Branes: Good! Then why do you guys still cling to the modern equivalent of chipping flint arrow-heads?
00:43  gnormandin: Branes: but we have here a case of conditionaing... if I have a keyboard "muscle memory" doing stuff on the keyboard is faster...
00:43  gnormandin: *conditioning
00:43  gnormandin: that.. and apple needs to FTFF
00:44  Cam: Fight the fucking firefox?
00:44  Cam: :D
00:44  Branes: You should never have been allowed that conditioning in the first place. Which is why the computng community has utterly failed humanity and the only thing they've managed to do collectively is make things more complex, more insane, and more user-hostile.
00:44  gnormandin: Branes: case in point: delete item using the finder: usually 2 steps, and the second step does the deltion and takes a while
00:44  Cam: Branes; Just agree with me. For now (FOR NOW) it is much easier to do complex tasks using the command line compared to finder.
00:44  gnormandin: steps to delete on the terminal?
00:44  gnormandin: 1
00:44  Branes: I re-iterate -- learn how computers work, you stop being human.
00:44  gnormandin: and it's faster than finder's step 2
00:44  Branes: No, Cam. Never.
00:44  Cam: Branes; Let's time.
00:45  Cam: I will send you a zip of 1000 mp3's with 2500 textfiles
00:45  Cam: And we can time eachother. Who can delete the mp3's first.
00:45  Branes: No you bloody well won't.
00:45  gnormandin: Branes: please respond to my point
00:45  Cam: You use finder. I use terminal.
00:45  Cam: You *will* lost.
00:45  Cam: -t+e
00:46  Branes: Number of steps is an irrelevancy, Norman. The art of any tool is to reduce the available vocabularity to a small, intuitive set. No commandline, hell, no written language, can do that.
00:46  Cam: and Branes, the day you beat me? I will delete terminal.
00:46  gnormandin: Branes: if I understand your arguement correctly it's that if we are forced to think like a machine, that we lose our humanity, our identity?
00:46  Cam: Branes; but there IS NO TOOL to do what I want EXCEPT the command line
00:46  Cam: I want my files deleted NOW.
00:46  Branes: It is more efficient, and more adaptable in the long term, to have less than ten vocabulary elements.
00:46  Cam: Not in 45 minutes.
00:46  gnormandin: Branes: pray tell, how does one write an application without text/commandline?
00:46  Branes: Marten.
00:47  Cam: bbl
00:47  Branes: Gods gift to programming, and the latest, most thorough graphical programming environment for the Macintosh since HyperCard.
00:47  gnormandin: how would one write a kernel, or tcp/ip stack w/o text/commandline?
00:47  gnormandin: Drivers?
00:47  Branes: The same.
00:47  gnormandin: ie... the low level stuff your GUI runs on top of?
00:47  Branes: The same.
00:48  Branes: (Yes, Marten is *that* good)
00:48  gnormandin: do you happen to have a reference to marten? I come from the Linux world... and I'm not familiar
00:49  Branes: www.andescotia.com/
00:49  gnormandin: yeah, just found it 8-)
00:50  Branes: The lead programmer wrote OpenFirmware, and also did Apple's implementation of it. In Forth, I might add :) And he hangs out in #macosx.
00:50  gnormandin: I dont see how I could write a driver that accesses hardware registers with this
00:50  Branes: He's older than I am :)
00:51  Branes: Ha. Dude, the first program he wrote with Marten 0.8 was a driver for his Unikey.
00:51  gnormandin: I'm reading some examples though
00:51  gnormandin: before I say for sure
00:52  gnormandin: Branes: it does look interesting... real code via a UML type interface
00:52  gnormandin: tree-based programming
00:53  luist: wth is wrong with this iMovie export... the video looks great in iMovie but when i export its widescreen and with a terrible sound
00:53  gnormandin: luist: check your volume levels and video output format?
00:54  luist: gnormandin: how? cant i just export exactly as it is in iMovie?
00:54  gnormandin: what version of imovie?
00:55  luist: 2011
00:55  gnormandin: Branes: I will be ab it of a smartass and say: you still need to type on the keyboard for input 8-)
00:55  gnormandin: luist One sec
00:56  Branes: Yes, but you can use your *own* native language, you don't have to learn another.
00:56  Branes: That's what I mean about teaching computers how humans work.
00:56  gnormandin: bbiaf
00:56  LetsGo67: I'm trying over and over again to get AR5005 Wireless working in Tiger.  Can someone help please?
00:57  Branes: Any good tool will have a working interface vocabulary that is limited to a subset of what its operator already knows. And despite what most of you geeks seem to think, flexibility is often not a good thing -- choice breeds confusion, confusion breeds frustration, frustration leads to hate, and hate leads to twinkies.
00:59  LetsGo67: Help please!
01:04  LetsGo67: I'm tired.  I need help.
01:07  LetsGo67: Why am I the ONLY person who can't get DWL-G510 working?
01:10  Branes: Perhaps because it uses a different chipset than the '20>
01:10  Branes: ?
01:10  LetsGo67: And I Google over and over again.  Branes, it's AR5005 but it won't work in Tiger.
01:11  Branes: Then perhaps the device's interface isn't something recognised by MacOS, or is x86-dependent and you're using a PowerPC ... which wouldn't suprise me.
01:11  LetsGo67: I thought that was what Windows was supposed to be.  Look for drivers, they don't work...
01:12  LetsGo67: Why not PowerPC?
01:12  Branes: Different code in the device's bootstrap ROM.
01:12  LetsGo67: I'm tired of wasting my time trying out drivers that don't work!
01:13  Branes: Then change device.
01:13  Branes: Find one which you know *does* work with PowerPC and MacOS.
01:18  LetsGo67: I just want to cry.  I'm trying to do everything right.  This card will work in Windows and Linux but not Mac.  Anything that I try to do for the greater good is waster.
01:19  LetsGo67: Someone in this room please tell me that I can buy a router and convert it into a wireless adapter.
01:19  LetsGo67: Tell me the truth.
01:19  LetsGo67: Can I use a router as a wireless adapter?
01:21  Branes: No, that's not possible.
01:21  LetsGo67: And so why not?
01:21  LetsGo67: Someone told me it was.
01:21  Branes: Because you're asking the deivce to work backwards.
01:22  LetsGo67: Is there an Ethernet to Wi-Fi adapter?
01:22  Branes: Yes; several. MacSense AeroPad is a good one.
01:22  Branes: That said, if you're using a desktop or tower, you should attempt to use a cable.
01:24  Branes: If you cannot print the internet connectopn point to the computer, or run a suitable length of cat5, look at EoP, ethernet-over-power, and take advantage of your house mains wiring by turn it into a building-wide ethernet network.
01:24  Branes: s/print/bring
01:25  LetsGo67: I'll hopefully find a wireless card that will work with this Mac.  :'(
01:26  Branes: Homeplug is the name of the standard, many companies have adopted it, and a twin-pack of HomePlug adaptors will cost you less than an AeroPad will.
01:27  Branes: You also gain almost 100bT speeds (up to six times faster than wifi for throughput), it is plug-and-play and requires no drivers at all for any OS, and you bypass all the problems of interference, as well as being secure from hacking.
01:29  LetsGo67: Hopefully it costs less than that.  See you soon.
01:29  Tomis: you can get a router and set it to bridge mode, and have it join another network 
01:29  Tomis: the airport express can do just that
01:29  Tomis: cheeper to just get a usb wifi dongle though
01:35  luist: geeez this iMovie is so crazy... when i move my movie to the project, it zooms in the video and cut the border.... how can i fix this
01:40 --- MobGod_ is now known as MobGod
01:45  luist: can anyone help me with this?
