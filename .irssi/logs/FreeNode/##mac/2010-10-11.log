10:09  muzik: How do you tell a christian windows user they are an idiot? :(
10:16  Branes: ... well he *could* have mentioned that most christians treat their beloved Bible like a software licence, they just scroll to the bottom and click 'I agree' ...

12:20  iaj: Is there someone using irssi on mac?
12:23  danl: iaj: I do
12:33  iaj: danl: neat.. well what do you for highlighting, and notifying?
12:34  danl: well, my highlights show in pink, I have a separate channel window that logs my highlights and I get a growl notification on highlight
12:41  iaj: danl: how did you get that to work.. can you show me your configuration?
12:41  iaj: espc the growl thing :)
12:46  danl: iaj: just some simple perl scripts
12:46  danl: got them all from the scripts repo for irssi
12:46  danl: http://scripts.irssi.org/
12:46  iaj: which ones? :O I checked there already
12:46  danl: except maybe the growl one
12:47  iaj: oO can you pastebin?
12:47  danl: I'm not on or near my mac at the moment, so unfortunately, I can't :(
12:47  b3ny0-: I "use" irssi in osx
12:48  b3ny0-: but its not running in it
12:48  danl: how are you using it?
12:48  danl: n/m
12:48  danl: thought iaj said that
12:48  danl: lol
12:48  danl: iaj: the highlight window script is: hilightwin at the link aboce
12:48  danl: *above
12:49  b3ny0-: ssh via terminal
12:49  b3ny0-: but I guess most commands are the same
12:49  danl: yea, but the growl script won't work that way ;)
12:51  danl: iaj: the growl script: http://pastie.org/1212679
12:51  danl: yay for ssh
12:56  iaj: thanks buddies - ill take a look at it in a sec - just received... orders! :'(
12:56  danl: mmk
12:57  danl: Keep in mind, none of that will work if you didn't install irssi using ports and with the +perl option
12:57  danl: (I don't think0
12:57  danl: The version of Perl that OS X comes with it outdated
13:03  antii: mcL: MAN!
13:07  iaj: danl: im acutally using lotsa perl scripts already
13:07  danl: iaj: mmm
13:07  danl: *mmmk
13:07  iaj: just now theres a vim script in development which made me use irssi :-)
13:16  cYmen: Does anybody know how to turn off the built-in touchpad? It's broken and keeps sending wrong signals...

13:57  keystr0k: Everything worked fine... just thought the URL was strange
14:02  iaj: danl: what about that Growl.pm ? I can't load up the script because I'm lacking the file it seems.
14:03  danl: it needs to be installed via CPAN
14:10  LetsGo67: Mac OS X Tiger shows up with SpotLight in the corner, no dock, no other bars.  Rainbow wheel spins and spins.  What does this mean?
14:13  LetsGo67: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=843780
14:16  iaj: danl: how do I do that?
14:18  LetsGo67: For my problem, I think it is the CMOS battery.  Thanks anyway.
14:21  danl: iaj: using the command: cpan Mac::Growl
14:21  danl: you may need to run it as sudo
14:25  iaj: danl: hmm I tried.. but... http://pastebin.com/yXPwpMvj
14:25  danl: then try: sudo port install Mac::Growl
14:28  MrUnagi: mornin
14:28  danl: mornin MrUnagi 
14:29  MrUnagi: sup my man
14:29  MrUnagi: i got my phone updated and good to go
14:29  MrUnagi: i just hate to think i have to wipe it for every update
14:29  danl: normal ota's shouldn't need tow ipe it
14:29  danl: *to wipe it
14:29  danl: I think it was because you rooted ;)
14:30  MrUnagi: i know it is
14:30  MrUnagi: but thats what i mean
14:30  danl: It's like the risk you run updating a jailbroken iPhone ;)
14:30  MrUnagi: i thought that turning s-on would allow ota to work
14:31  MrUnagi: maybe there is some way to backup my data and settings
14:31  danl: I wonder if s-off is preventing my ota
14:31  MrUnagi: probably
14:31  MrUnagi: after you said that i noticed that mine was off
14:31 * danl ponders
14:31  MrUnagi: and to unroot it i had to turn it back on the restore to factory
14:31  MrUnagi: oh man
14:31  MrUnagi: i bet i could have m anually updated
14:31  MrUnagi: i only tried ota with s on
14:32  MrUnagi: ugh i should have tried that
14:32  MrUnagi: do you have to turn s on to manually update?
14:32  DarkStar1: just a quick question. do MBPs hard drives disengage if the laptops are dropped? like some (apparently) PC laptops 
14:33  iaj: danl: not missing something? cannot find a package called Mac::Growl
14:33 * danl shrugs
14:33  danl: I forgot how I installed it iaj
14:33  DarkStar1: sorry accidentally left
14:33  danl: DarkStar1: they are suppose to.
14:33  danl: It's the purpose of the SMS
14:33  iaj: danl: :\ damn.. don't you have a bash history :)
14:33  danl: (Sudden motion sensor)
14:33  MrUnagi: DarkStar1: yes
14:34  MrUnagi: DarkStar1: at least mine does
14:34  DarkStar1: danl: sms?
14:34  MrUnagi: i hear an audible chirp if i move it too fast
14:34  danl: see above
14:34  DarkStar1: Ok thanks
14:34  MrUnagi: it use to disengage all the time
14:34  MrUnagi: whether i moved it or not, that was frustrating
14:34  MrUnagi: bought my first mac, and that happens, i was like crap i made the WRONG decision
14:35  DarkStar1: what were you dong Yanking it?
14:35  MrUnagi: no....it was a software issue
14:37  DarkStar1: Any thoughts on usng smc fan control?
14:37  danl: you can turn the sms off, some aftermarket drives require it
14:37  danl: DarkStar1: I have smc fan control
14:37  danl: I use it to keep my fan running max most of the tiem
14:37  danl: *time
14:37  danl: my macbook stays hot
14:37  DarkStar1: was thinking of downloading it but I figure the OS mightnot be happy with it
14:37  MrUnagi: heh
14:38  MrUnagi: i have no desire to control my fans
14:38  MrUnagi: though running max might be ok
14:38  MrUnagi: theyre so damn quiet
14:38  danl: MrUnagi: I found with flash, they dont stay running on high enough
14:38  MrUnagi: i dont run flash all that often
14:38  MrUnagi: sad that flash runs hotter than 3d apps
14:39  DarkStar1: Maybe that's what pissed of jobs and said the iphone will not support it
14:39  MrUnagi: nah
14:39  MrUnagi: its because flash is buggy
14:39  MrUnagi: i have it on my evo and its horrible
14:39  MrUnagi: buggy
14:39  MrUnagi: and a huge memory hog for no reason
14:40  DarkStar1: aye since adobe took em over they seemed to hog resources ever since 
14:40  KaOSoFt: With the latest update, Flash works just fine on my HTC Desire.
14:40  KaOSoFt: With the latest update
14:40  MrUnagi: i have no problem being flash less as long as there are apps for what uses flash on desktop
14:41  b3ny0-: flash is some kind of bad joke
14:41  KaOSoFt: "The real practical joke..."
14:41  MrUnagi: lol
14:42  MrUnagi: flash even feels dated to me
14:42  MrUnagi: like 'ooooh this was the future in the late 90s'
14:42  b3ny0-: imho flash has always been a piece of shit
14:42  b3ny0-: and I'm not just talking on mac, its crap in windows too
14:43  crilly: b3ny0-: watch your language for me bud
14:43  crilly: and yeah Flash is crap 
14:43  b3ny0-: sorry, it can be colorful at ties
14:44  MrUnagi: :D
14:44  crilly: ;]
14:44  MrUnagi: crilly: at least it was used in a correct context
14:45  crilly: haha yeah i'll give him that
14:45  MrUnagi: hehe
14:47  crilly: Google Chrome has grown on me; it's super fast.
14:48  b3ny0-: its what I use
14:49  MrUnagi: i dunno why i am resisting chrome
14:49  crilly: Seems as though you can write pretty complex addons for it, so I think it's a good plstform
14:49  crilly: seems to be a lot of addons too
14:51  MrUnagi: am i razy for enjoying safari?
14:51  MrUnagi: lol
14:51  MrUnagi: crazy*
14:52  b3ny0-: I liked it, except for one thing
14:52  b3ny0-: you can't google search directly in the adress bar
14:52  b3ny0-: that annoyed me
14:54  MrUnagi: i can see that as being annoying, but im so use to going slightly to the right that it doesnt bother me
14:54  b3ny0-: I was too used to chrome from windows
14:55  crilly: Safari: Alt+Cmd+F = Google search
14:55  MrUnagi: nice crilly 
14:55  MrUnagi: thats an odd keystroke
14:55  MrUnagi: almost like zapping the pram
14:56  MrUnagi: zapping pram = yoga for the fingers
14:56  crilly: and Cmd+L takes you into the address bar and lets you type in a new address.
14:56  crilly: overwriting the curent one

15:39 @crilly: b3ny0-: Come on now, you've been warned.
15:39 @crilly: If you want to be in this commnunity, you will have to control your use of foul language.
15:40  b3ny0-: feel free to come up with a better pseudonym for a company that ruined half the earth
15:40 @crilly: Foul language doesn't make you look intelligent.
15:40 @crilly: It degrades it, in fact.
15:43  b3ny0-: yes, well while I respect the rules of the channel (if there is one that forbids it), I don't believe in preventing a person to speak his mind, nothing personal
15:43  MrUnagi: you cant speak your mind without swearing?
15:44 @crilly: I'm not preventing you from speaking your mind, I'm encouraging you to improve your diction.
15:44  koro: Foul language can be pretty intelligent!
15:44  MrUnagi: can it?
15:45  b3ny0-: I fully agree about mindless swearing and slandering, but it can in fact be beneficial to get a message across 
15:45 @crilly: It can be witty, at most.
15:45  koro: Of course.
15:45  b3ny0-: all forms of abuse are bad
15:45  MrUnagi: trolling is bad too
15:45  koro: b3ny0-: yes.
15:45  koro: Foul language is not a form of abuse. Abuse of foul language is.

15:45  b3ny0-: very much so
15:46  koro: It's not. I'm shutting up.

15:47  b3ny0-: I dunno, can't say I'm thrilled over it, just speaking my mind is all
15:47  b3ny0-: anyways, change of subject
15:48 @crilly: Good call.
15:48  b3ny0-: I apologize but I'm not normally around people that are easily offended
15:48 * MrUnagi sighs
15:48  koro: I really do want an ipad.
15:49  koro: Just sayin'.
15:49  koro: Apple won't sell it on these parts of the world :(
15:49  b3ny0-: they don't sell it here either yet
15:49  b3ny0-: hurry up already
15:50  koro: Where's that?
15:50 @crilly: I had the chance to get one for £100, but it would be unless for me.
15:50  b3ny0-: sweden
15:50  koro: Omg. 100 pounds. I WANT.
15:50  b3ny0-: consumer electrics are always ridiculously expensive here too
15:51  koro: I could try to buy one on ebay here, but it's like $1300 (lol)
15:51  b3ny0-: everything is like 500$ more than it is in the US
15:51  koro: b3ny0-: same here... but it's easier: everything is between 200 and 300% the price in the US
15:51  koro: sometimes more
15:52  koro: and the worst part is not the price, it's that even if you want to pay the price, it's not always easy to find what you want

17:09  cosmo_: what method of encryption does osx use on user passwords?
17:09  _KaszpiR_: md5 probably
17:12  KaOSoFt: MD5... only?
17:17  ichdertom: mhh now i wanted to answer 
17:17  ichdertom: he/she/it parts
17:18  _KaszpiR_: more info about passwords are in manuals
17:18  _KaszpiR_: man passwd
17:18  _KaszpiR_: and
17:18  _KaszpiR_: man crypt
17:19  _KaszpiR_: so its DES
17:20  cosmo_: thank you _KaszpiR_ 
17:22  ichdertom: simple des?
17:22  ichdertom: which means the keychain is not really secure is it?
17:23  _KaszpiR_: keychain is rather different story
17:24  _KaszpiR_: keychain is encoded by triple des
17:24  _KaszpiR_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28Mac_OS%29
17:24  alexbobP: ichdertom: not simple DES, a DES-based salted and slowed hash
17:24  alexbobP: ichdertom: I personally wouldn't still use DES in anything, but DES-based crypt is probably safe
17:25  ichdertom: well okay Triple-DES for keychain files sounds fair
17:25  ichdertom: if i give the system access to a key
17:25  _KaszpiR_: i suggest crypting whole disk anyway
17:25  alexbobP: meh, I wouldn't use a keychain that used triple-des
17:26  alexbobP: but I had the foresight to not use the mac os x keychain anyways
17:26  ichdertom: and somebody changes the password by resetting it the system doesn't have any access any more does it?
17:26 * alexbobP doesn't trust closed-source stuff
17:26  alexbobP: _KaszpiR_: there's a way to encrypt the whole disk on mac os?
17:26  _KaszpiR_: partitions for sure
17:26  ichdertom: i have an encrypted sparsebundle
17:26  alexbobP: can I encrypt the main partition?
17:26  _KaszpiR_: or at least userdir
17:27  alexbobP: ugh, I hope you're not talking about filevault
17:27  _KaszpiR_: main, hm not sure,
17:27  _KaszpiR_: never used srypting uder mac os x
17:27  alexbobP: I tried it, and it was super-buggy, I had to backup all my data so I could delete it so it would un-break
17:27  _KaszpiR_: but i suggest to see TrueCrypt
17:27  alexbobP: truecrypt only supports system disk encryption in windows
17:27  ichdertom: well I'm not talking about filevault but about an encrypted sparsebundle built by disc tool with 128 bit aes. do you think this is unsafe?
17:27  _KaszpiR_: hmm maybe you're right
17:28  alexbobP: and on linux we have luks which is great
17:28  _KaszpiR_: but nayway you can make a one huge file on the disk and mount it under osx ;D
17:28  alexbobP: mac os x just seems to be pretty behind in crypto tools
17:28  _KaszpiR_: as all osx ;)
17:29  alexbobP: I thought mac os x is the only os x...
17:29  alexbobP: there's no dell os x that I haven't heard about is there?
17:29  ichdertom: .oO( lool )
17:30  ichdertom: alexbobP: he probably meant as osx in general
17:32  CPng|N: lol
17:34  alexbobP: ichdertom: oh, lacking in general and not just in crypto?
17:34  alexbobP: I dunno about that... os x is pretty strong in window-minize-effects
17:35  alexbobP: *minimize

17:37  MrUnagi: is there a terminal tool that will show me what channel other networks are on around me
17:40 * LaraWeb uses webchat instead :|
17:43  alexbobP: b3ny0-: that looks interesting but it doesn't make sense
17:43  alexbobP: b3ny0-: they aren't explaining how their product fits extra hard drives in your computer!
17:43  b3ny0-: you remove the dvd burner
17:44  b3ny0-: and install a drive holder there
17:44  alexbobP: oh lol
17:44  alexbobP: well that makes sense then
17:44  b3ny0-: then you get a casing with usb adaptor for your removed drive so you can still use it as an external drive
17:44  alexbobP: so they want me to pay $100 for what?  the enclosure with a hard drive?  or just the enclosure?
17:45  alexbobP: because that's some BS :P
17:45  alexbobP: I can get an external enclosure and a tube of superglue for a lot less, and keep my optical drive!
17:45  b3ny0-: the internal enclosure + the burner enclosure
17:46  alexbobP: well I guess it would be nice
17:46  alexbobP: right now I have an SSD in my mbp
17:46  alexbobP: so it would be nice to also put in a hard drive and get some real storage
17:46  b3ny0-: I am planning to install an SSD into mine
17:46  alexbobP: 64GB is okay, and it's fast, but it's not a lot of space
17:47  b3ny0-: but it would be nice with a storage drive as well
17:47  alexbobP: yeah
17:47  alexbobP: well this is kind of appealing actually
17:47  alexbobP: I don't use the optical drive all that much
17:47  b3ny0-: and lugging around on an internal drive is a bit of a pain
17:47  b3ny0-: I don't think I've used it once since I got it
17:47  b3ny0-: like two months ago
17:47  b3ny0-: :P
17:48  b3ny0-: so you might as well hook it up to usb when you need it
17:48  alexbobP: yeah
17:48  alexbobP: well I'v been thinking I'll probably sell my mac soon
17:49  alexbobP: and try to buy a non-mac laptop
17:49  alexbobP: otherwise I'd seriously consider this
17:49  bove: I'm trying to find the names for some files copied in Finder over a week ago. Would I find a log for that somewhere?
17:50  b3ny0-: I've been a windows user all my life and I wouldn't trade this laptop for a win one
17:50  b3ny0-: windows is pretty daft on portable devices
17:51  bassliner: MrUnagi: if you found it, please let me know. i know for linux there is "iwlist scanning" that will show up wireless lan networks.
17:52  Angostura: bove: Sorry - could you explain a bit more what you are trying to do?

22:22  londonmet050: hello
22:22  londonmet050: any one used terminal split screen
22:22  londonmet050: Can you cycle between 2 screens?
22:22  londonmet050: split pane
22:22  ChrisAM: using screen?
22:23  londonmet050: LIke if you split the terminal
22:24  londonmet050: I can only work in the lower one
22:24  londonmet050: So why does one want to use split pane
22:25  ChrisAM: you can use screen to do that
22:25  londonmet050: ?
22:25  londonmet050: what screen
22:25  ChrisAM: GNU screen
22:26  londonmet050: So u cannot split the terminal and work
22:26  ChrisAM: yes
22:26  londonmet050: how
22:26  ChrisAM: go to Window -> Split Pane
22:26  londonmet050: I id
22:26  londonmet050: *did
22:26  londonmet050: it splits

22:26  londonmet050: only in the down one
22:26  londonmet050: I can work
22:27  Angostura: You effectively want 2 terminal windows?
22:27  londonmet050: yes

22:51  londonmet050: ChrisAM:  you there
22:55  londonmet050: so split pane is to just scroll
22:55  londonmet050: that sucks
22:55  Angostura: londonmet050: Can you give examples of a terminal on any platform that acts the way you would like?
22:55  londonmet050: ok
22:56  londonmet050: split the screen in to 2
22:56  londonmet050: so I can work between them
22:56  londonmet050: tab's make one window visible at one time
22:56  Angostura: Is that a "no" then?
22:57  londonmet050: I am not sure
22:57  londonmet050: but that is what I am looking for
