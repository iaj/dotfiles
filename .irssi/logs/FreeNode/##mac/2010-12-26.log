22:09  kateweb: mobile me keeps trying to sync how do i tell it to stop? I dont even have mobile me
22:09  kateweb: it all started when i pluged an iphone in
22:14  WarpZone: I need help.  An internet-enabled program on my macbook pro is not detecting an internet connection, even though firefox and adium and so on can all use it.  The developer of the program says they think it's a firewall.  I have already told the mac OSX firewall in System Preferences to allow it.  So now the question becomes what other firewall might exist on my computer?
22:14  WarpZone: Using OSX 10.5.8
22:15  WarpZone: Whatever program this is, it does not appear at the bottom of the screen while it is running.
22:16  Swian: I'm not aware of any "other" firewall other then the systme one
22:16  Swian: system
22:16  WarpZone: hmmm
22:17  WarpZone: Or any other program that could interrupt an internet connection?  They said Little Snitch was an example of a program that could do that, even though technically not classed as a firewall since it monitors outgoing connections, too.
22:19  WarpZone: Or really, anything at all you can think of that might cause it.
22:20  Swian: sorry, no ideas
22:20  Swian: what is the app that's not working?
22:21  WarpZone: Unity3D's online store.
22:21  Swian: is that web based?
22:21  Swian: or is it an app
22:21 --- Bensawsome is now known as Guest12245
22:22  WarpZone: Unity.app is the app.  There is a menu option which launches the web store.  The "loading" bar appears to be a novel implementation.  (not anything I've seen in another standard app)  More than that I couldn't tell you.  Supposing it's not web-based, what else besides a firewall could be responsible?
22:23  Swian: can't think of anything, does it work when you turn the firewall off?
22:23  WarpZone: Nope.
22:23  Swian: then its not the firewall
22:23  WarpZone: Actually hang on.  Could my router be blocking apps selectively?
22:24  Swian: not likely
22:24  WarpZone: hmm
22:24  Swian: unless its a specific port you need open
22:24  Swian: find out which port the app uses
22:24  WarpZone: I have no way of knowing that.
22:24  Swian: you can google for it
22:25  WarpZone: I google "Unity online store" port I get nothing.  Apparently other human beings are not asking this question, and unity's developer see no reason to document it anywhere.
22:26  Swian: don't know what to tell you then, did it ever work?
22:27  Swian: and have you tried putting the machine you're using on the DMZ for your router?
22:28  WarpZone: No it did not ever work.  The developer seems to think it's a problem at my end, not something that affects other users.  What is a DMZ and how do I put my machine on it?

22:38  WarpZone: I don't think I can get into this.
22:39  Swian: can always reset to factory defaults
22:39  Swian: admin admin for username and passwork
22:39 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 75 seconds
22:39  WarpZone: Okay, if I can find the documentation that came with the router, I'll know what the default password is.  Would power-cycling the router restore it to factory state?  And does factory state include the admin password?
22:39  Swian: no
22:39  Swian: there is usually a button you need to hold in for 30 secons
22:39  Swian: seconds
22:39  WarpZone: Okay.
22:40  Swian: with a paper clip tip or something
22:40  WarpZone: Gotcha.
22:40  WarpZone: I'll save that for a last resort.  Thanks.
22:41  Swian: I set my router up first thing, but I go into mine often

23:15  zzing: Quicktime tells me this: "An invalid sample description was found in the movie." It still plays fine in quicktime X, but doesn't open in 7. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
23:17  crilly: Import it into iMovie and perhaps back out again? That might resolve the issue.
