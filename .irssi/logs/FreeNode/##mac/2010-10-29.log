02:58  nchase: anyone encounter steam on mac thrashing the hell out of their hard drive?
03:00  mmav: hi, is anyone around?
03:01  CPng|N: no
03:01  mmav: haha
03:02  mmav: I have a strange issue with snow leopard, as of today
03:02  mmav: apparently the OS only sporadically responds to mouseover things, like highlighting the button the cursor is on, or showing the names of the apps in the dock on mouseovee
03:02  mmav: r
03:03  mmav: also had a random kernel panic earlier today
03:04  EdLin: mmav, try reinstalling, you can do that while keeping your data you know.
03:04  EdLin: it's a lot more pain-free than Windows in that regard....
03:04  mmav: how do I do that, just boot from the DVD?
03:05  EdLin: mmav, the DVD has the proper selections, yes.
03:05  mmav: meh
03:06  mmav: and I'll keep all my applications as well?
03:06  EdLin: mmav, if you're lucky enough to be using Time Machine, you can even restore without using addititional space while saving the data.
03:06  mmav: I'm not a time machine user, unfortunately
03:06  EdLin: mmav, then you'll need to have enough space both for the old data and the OS.
03:07  mmav: I have 100gb free
03:07  EdLin: mmav, that's fine then.
03:07  mmav: but will it install the OS twice?
03:07  mmav: one old version and a clean one?
03:07  mmav: I've only installed SL a couple weeks ago :/
03:08  EdLin: mmav, it will install the OS once, and put all of your old stuff in another directory tree, where it can be moved back.
03:09 --- peshalto_ is now known as peshalto
03:09  EdLin: mmav, unlike Windows, which has the registry, it's practical to be able to move back many applications straight from there to /Applications
03:09  mmav: yeah
03:09  mmav: meh
03:09  mmav: this is frustrating
03:09  mmav: it's such a random bug
03:09  EdLin: mmav, you probably have a corrupt file somewhere in your OS. It happens.
03:10  mmav: alright, I'll try reinstalling
03:10  mmav: thanks
03:10  EdLin: np
03:11  mmav: lol
03:11  mmav: I just reset the mouse
03:12  mmav: and everything is a-okay again
03:13  EdLin: hmm, OK. I had a similar problem and only getting the OS reinstalled really solved it. You say you're having KPs. That indicates either corrupt files or a hardware problem usually.
03:13  mmav: I've only had one
03:14  mmav: do you know where I can find the kernel panic logs, so I can find what caused it?
03:14  EdLin: oh, OK. Well, if you have problems again, remember your option of reinstalling.
03:14  EdLin: Console.app
03:16  mmav: haha there's a lot of messages there, do you know the Sender[PID]?
03:16  EdLin: mmav, I think there's a search box you can use to filter them.
03:17  mmav: I wouldn't know what to search for, kernel and panic both turn up 0 results
03:17  EdLin: mmav, usually the information is not all that informative to a non-OS-hacker anyway.
03:17  mmav: it doesn't work like Windows' BSODs?
03:18  EdLin: BSODs aren't that informative to non-OS hackers, but no, there's no standard code.
03:18  EdLin: mmav, you just figure out what it was doing before the exception hit.
03:24  mmav: that'd be great, if I can find the panic haha
03:30  SixEcho: i'm trying to get my mac hooked up to my samsung TV via a displayport+hdmi cable I have… works fine - however cannot get the screen to fit the TV.  Mac shows 1080p resolution, but it's too small, and overscan is too big.  Installed SwitchResX — and the current 1080p frequency match the TV's spec exactly 1920x1080 67.50KHz horiz, 60.00Hz vert  — anyone have any experience getting a perfect fit over HDMI?
03:53  LetsGo67: Hello gang!  My Mac sounds like a barber shop shaver.  Is that normal?
03:53  LetsGo67: Power Macintosh G3.
03:55  koro: LetsGo67: yes. You can even shave with it.
03:55  LetsGo67: lol :)
03:56  sr0z: iShave
03:56  LetsGo67: No, but what does this electric sound mean, Koro?  I don't really want iShave, unless maybe Apple makes a shaver.  ;)
03:56  Tsavo: my Macbook sounds like that when there is a CD spinning and i pick it up
03:56  LetsGo67: Tsavo: eg. Your Macbook sounds like when the barber shaves hair off?
03:57  Tsavo: it's the CD hitting the insides of the disk bay because the laptop bends
03:57  LetsGo67: I thought Apple was good quality.  :(
03:58  LetsGo67: Is the Mac SE FDHD a good computer?
03:58  Tsavo: it's because the bay is so narrow. almost any bending (it's a 2006 macbook, so it's a plastic shell) will cause it to rub
03:58  koro: dude, isn't that computer like 15 years old
03:58  LetsGo67: Yes but it has MS Word and MS Excel
03:58 * LetsGo67 will replace it with non-MS equivalents.
03:58  koro: it must be the hard disk petrifying
03:59  LetsGo67: No, Koro.  The hard disk is an army shooting gun.
03:59  LetsGo67: But it's a lovely sound nonetheless.  50 watts or less.
04:00  LetsGo67: As opposed to stupid computers today that take 140 or more for the tower alone.  #MDG
04:00  LetsGo67: And they are slow and they run M_______t W_____s V___a.
04:01  EdLin: LetsGo67, nobody sells computers now with Vista, they all have Windows 7....
04:01  Tu13es: my MBP uses about 50W under full load :)
04:01  EdLin: Tu13es, my Mac mini uses less than that. :)
04:01  Tu13es: my MBP is faster :)
04:01  EdLin: and it was before the "Green minis" too, which use less than 20 watts I think.
04:02  EdLin: yeah, rub it in.
04:02  Tu13es: yeah, crazy how little power they use
04:02  LetsGo67: EdLin: No, Steve Jobs quit because Vista, which sold tens of dozens of copies, was overtaking Leopard.
04:02  LetsGo67: EdLin: Mac Mini has no screen.
04:02  LetsGo67: Mac SE FDHD has monochrome screen.
04:02  EdLin: LetsGo67, you're in an alternate universe now. Steve Jobs quit about 20 years ago, and rejoined in the late 90s.
04:03  LetsGo67: EdLin: No, Steve Jobs quit on a YouTube video in the Leopard era...
04:03  EdLin: LetsGo67, you aren't serious, are you?
04:03  LetsGo67: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KftrYHIu9O8
04:04  Tu13es: hm, looks like the screen only uses about 6W or so
04:04  LetsGo67: Tu13es: What is the screen.
04:04  Tu13es: my MBP screen
04:05  LetsGo67: "Leopard's gonna get lost in all of that WOW."
04:05  EdLin: Tu13es, LED backlit, ftw.
04:05  LetsGo67: We don't have cash.
04:05  Tu13es: yep
04:05  LetsGo67: Apple Studio?
04:05  Tu13es: no, MBP
04:06  LetsGo67: SO THE YOUTUBE VIDEO is proof that Steve Jobs QUIT!
04:06  LetsGo67: Tu13es: Generic?  As long as it works well, why not? :)
04:06  koro: troll
04:06  Tu13es: yes
04:06  LetsGo67: Mac Best Peripherals is what MBP stands for.
04:07 * EdLin wanders off, tired of lame trolling
04:07  Tu13es: go away
04:07  LetsGo67: What is wrong?  YouTube clip is supposed to be a joke, for anyone who cared to watch it. :S
04:08  EdLin: LetsGo67, using youtube videos as "proof" of a troll is fujisan material.
04:09  LetsGo67: Fujitsu?  Fujifilm?  Sorry?
04:09  Tsavo: I thought the video was funny..
04:09  LetsGo67: Tsavo, thanks.  :)
04:10  LetsGo67: If you like to use ADB keyboard in Tiger say 12345678987654321!
04:11  LetsGo67: and if you don't, then say those numbers in the inverse order.
04:12  LetsGo67: Then what is your favourite keyboard?
04:12  LetsGo67: Favourite web browser?

06:10  Tsavo: How does cloning work with Macs?
06:11  richardcavell: Tsavo: it works
06:11  richardcavell: What are you trying to ask?
06:11  Tsavo: From one to the other? My friend just bought a new MBP and he wants to clone everything over. Will Migration assistant do it to 100% accuracy
06:11  Tsavo: as if you're using the same Mac
06:12  richardcavell: Yes
06:12  richardcavell: It doesn't clone the entire hard drive, just the apps and documents and so on
06:12  richardcavell: Migration Assistant works really well
06:12  Tsavo: how far does it go? will it copy over preferences and stuff that isn't computer specific like appearance and passwords etc?
06:14  richardcavell: Yes, it will do preferences and accounts
06:14  Tsavo: ok thank you 
06:14  richardcavell: Migration Assistant is pretty robust in my experience
06:22  Kasm279: Tsavo: you can even have Migration Assistant copy over Mac OS9 if you have it installed on your G3 slot loading iMac or a G4 tower
06:22  Kasm279: (oldest ones that can do TDM)
06:23  Tsavo: he's going from a 2008 mbp to a new one, so no worries there. all he needs is a fw cable

16:03  Anita_Gofradump: ok i got a i7 imac with 24gb of ram, i want to install ubuntu on it, ok thats not the problem- but how can i read ext3 partitions in mac?
16:05  richardcavell: You mean read them in OS X.  It's difficult.
16:05  Anita_Gofradump: ya
16:05  richardcavell: it's only do-able for experts
16:05  richardcavell: For one thing you can only read ext2 not ext3
16:06  Anita_Gofradump: ext2 is ext3
16:06  richardcavell: And the program to do it is not actively maintained
16:06  Branes: Anita_Gofradump: You must run all non-supported OSes inside a virtual machine at all times. Attempting to run Ubuntu directly on Apple's custom hardware will result in premature CPU death.
16:06  Anita_Gofradump: ext3 is just ext2 with a master file table ro sometthing similar
16:06  koro: i would worry if a there was a freenode channel with 154 people in it devoted exclusively to big mac
16:07  richardcavell: Anita_Gofradump: Yes, you're right, I know.  But I'm saying you can't mount the special ext3 portions
16:07  richardcavell: If you're not an expert, the answer is basically: Don't try to mount ext under OS X
16:07  Anita_Gofradump: ah thats not so important
16:07  Anita_Gofradump: i just need them read only
16:08  richardcavell: The way you should do it is have OS X running at the same time and mount it as a network drive
16:08  Branes: Anita_Gofradump: Use OSX or Windows-with-Boot-Camp as your host OS, and keep Ubuntu inside a vitual machine via Virtualbox or VMware Fusion.
16:08  Anita_Gofradump: a external usb dump drive with movies and such stuff
16:08  richardcavell: Branes: Oh God here we go
16:08  Anita_Gofradump: branes: virtualbox, sounds interesting
16:08  Anita_Gofradump: thanks to mention it
16:09  Anita_Gofradump: does virtualbox support video acceleration by now?
16:09  Branes: Some.
16:10  Branes: As a free option, it's still the best for hosting a linux, esp. Ubuntu
16:10  crilly: :D
16:10  Anita_Gofradump: yeah with that amount of ram it is
16:11  crilly: No USB support in VB though boooo
16:11  richardcavell: I think VirtualBox is more actively developed than the commercial options, too
16:11  richardcavell: It has a community giving it support.  It's a hybrid of paid/commercial development and open-source community
16:12  Branes: Dev is about the same, but whilst vbox is geared towards improving over-all generic-PC equivalency, Fusion & Parallels are focused almost exclusively on Windows support.
16:12  richardcavell: And in my experience they're quick to respond to problems.  I mean, when Ubuntu 10.10 came out, they were very quick to update so that guest additions worked well
16:13  richardcavell: Branes: I suppose you have a point there
16:13  Branes: Naturally :) They go where the money is.
16:14  richardcavell: But I like the fact that VBox is so robust.  It is designed to work with any host and any guest.  That takes coding skill rather than coding kludges.
16:17  crilly: i don't know who would want to build a product to support Windows. As I keep saying to my friend's, "it's not that my Mac doesn't support your projector, it's the fact your projector doesn't support my Mac". Everything else is wrong.
16:18  richardcavell: Well people should have the option of running whatever OS they want
16:18  richardcavell: If people want to run Windows, why not?
16:18  crilly: NO!
16:18  crilly: OS X only!
16:19  Anita_Gofradump: someone tried to fit a gulftown hexacore into an imac i7?
16:19  richardcavell: The choice of operating system is a bit more important than the choice of what colour T-shirt you're going to wear.  Your choice of OS influences who controls the Internet and billions of dollars worth of the market
16:19  richardcavell: For masses of people to 'vote' to go with Windows or away from Windows is a very significant thing
16:20  richardcavell: it's not trivial
16:21  Anita_Gofradump: well i'm happy if i can run a XP64 within a mac
16:21  crilly: I'm happy if I can do what I need, which I can.
16:21  thedonvaughn: well you're speaking at the desktop level.  I think the server market infulences who 'controls' the internet more.  and linux is the dominant force behind most internet servers, i.e. web servers, dns, etc
16:21  thedonvaughn: and is gaining ground faster than ever expected in enterprise role
16:22  thedonvaughn: mac os x doesn't even have it's foot in the door when it comes to servers
16:22  richardcavell: yeah
16:22  richardcavell: Anyway I'd love to chat about this but I'm trying to sleep.
16:22  thedonvaughn: which is fine, their niche is the end user
16:22  thedonvaughn: and they do it excellent
16:28  crilly: thedonvaughn: Spot on. That's why I think Linux should stay in the server land.
