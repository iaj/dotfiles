00:07  MrUnagi: Fedayk1n: you an expert with grep?
00:08  Fedayk1n: an expert?
00:08  Fedayk1n: I've used grep a whole lot
00:08  Fedayk1n: but I wouldn't exactly say expert
00:17  CPng|N: I was once upon a tie
00:17  CPng|N: time
00:17  CPng|N: takes me a big longer now to come up with the more complex ones
00:17  CPng|N: assuming by grep you really mean Regular Expressions
00:19  CPng|N: personally it sound to me like mrunagi is port forwarding 22 to his machine, when he could probably just use a different external port and avoid much of these hack attempts
00:19  MrUnagi: CPng|N: i already changed it
00:19  MrUnagi: went from 20 an hour to 4 every few hours
00:19  CPng|N: ie: translate port 175636 external to 22 internal and just jot that weird #'d port somewhere like in your phone
00:19  CPng|N: ah
00:19  MrUnagi: i am kinda just doing this for fun
00:19  CPng|N: ok good!
00:19  CPng|N: gotcha
00:19  MrUnagi: :D
00:19  CPng|N: well done sir
00:19  CPng|N: lol
00:20  MrUnagi: i mean, think how hardened a server would be if you missed one root log in, your ip is blocked
00:20  MrUnagi: of course all root logins would fail, thats the point
00:24  MrUnagi: CPng|N: wanna see my script?
00:33  MrUnagi: now i need a way for the script to see what ip addresses have already been added to iptables and delete them from the log....or a copy of the log
00:33  MrUnagi: er i dunno how i would do this
00:37  dtrott: I have a script that disables the screen saver password whenever I am at home (and re-enables it when I leave) however if the screen is locked when I get home I still need to enter the password one time, is there a way to create a script which can programmatically unlock the screen? OSX 10.6.6
00:37  MrUnagi: wow....lol
00:38  MrUnagi: a very involved script to allow you to be lazy =)
00:38  dtrott: All my scripts are that way :-)
00:39  MrUnagi: it seems silly to be bothered by entering your password one time :D
00:40  dtrott: The real issue is that if you programatically disable the dialog it doesn't actually show up that one time
00:40  dtrott: you can still enter your password but the screen is completely black

03:09 +FriedBob: ChrisAM: I was just looking for something to listen to while I played Assassin's Creed, ate ramen, drank coffee and did some in home training.
03:09 +ChrisAM: sweet
03:09 +ChrisAM: Sugarpill is on now
03:13  MrUnagi: im still at work
03:13  MrUnagi: only 11 hours to go
03:13  MrUnagi: 13 down 11 to go hah
03:14 +ChrisAM: you work a 24 hour shift?
03:16  MrUnagi: about once a month
03:20 +ChrisAM: I used to have to do that in the Navy.
03:21  joobie: hey guys.. ive got an iphone that is running the latest firmware already.. however im having some weird problems (like i delete one mail account and then it removes all my mail accounts). I wanted to reload the latest firmware on my iphone, but itunes says i've already got it on.. how can i force it to reload the latest firmware again?
03:24  tonsofpcs: ##mac is ##iphone?
03:25 +FriedBob: Only when the moon is right.
03:25  MrUnagi: joobie: did you jailbreak
03:26  joobie: no
03:26  MrUnagi: i dont even have an iphone
03:27  MrUnagi: but i do have great news
03:27  MrUnagi: you can save a ton of money on your car insurance if you switch to geico
03:28 +FriedBob: Not a ton. 15%. A ton is one a different company.
03:28 +FriedBob: s/one//
03:28 +ChrisAM: I've never used an iPhone... sorry.
03:28 +FriedBob: Nor have I
03:28  Kasm279: i wonder if apple will fix the USB thing on the iPad
03:29  MrUnagi: Kasm279: i love you
03:29 +FriedBob: The ipad has a USB thing?
03:29  Kasm279: yeah, the camera adaptor
03:29  MrUnagi: ChrisAM: what phone do you have
03:29  Kasm279: with iOS4 on the iPad you can't use a keyboard with it because the current has been limited
03:29 +ChrisAM: I've got a BlackBerry Curve... but I'm probably going to get an HTC Evo soon.
03:30  MrUnagi: crapberry?!
03:30  MrUnagi: i have an evo
03:30  jenkinz: hello!!!
03:30 +ChrisAM: ohai
03:30  MrUnagi: HI!!!!!!
03:31  MrUnagi: omg jenkinz hi!!!
03:31  MrUnagi: oh em geeee
03:31  jenkinz: how can i configure a proxy for the whole system
03:31  Kasm279: im about to switch to either a Palm Tungsten W or a Sony Ericsson W200a
03:31 +ChrisAM: jenkinz ... network preferences
03:31  jenkinz: but does it apply for all the connections?
03:31  Kasm279: yes
03:31 +ChrisAM: no
03:31  Kasm279: or not
03:31  Kasm279: >.>
03:31 +ChrisAM: Anything using a browser.
03:31  jenkinz: even connections i make from the terminal?
03:32 +ChrisAM: A proxy for the whole system sounds more like a VPN.
03:32  jenkinz: :O ok
03:32  jenkinz: any good options?
03:32 +ChrisAM: What is your end goal?
03:33  MrUnagi: thats what a vpn sounds like to me
03:33  MrUnagi: vpn's are the death of me =/
03:33  jenkinz: hmmm anonymize my connections made from the terminal
03:33 +FriedBob: At my last job, our VPN server was named "Terminator"
03:33 +ChrisAM: jenkinz ... you might be better off getting a shell somewhere.
03:34  jenkinz: thats not it xD
03:34 +ChrisAM: It's hard to be truly anonymous though.
03:35 +ChrisAM: What sort of connections do you want to initiate from the terminal?
03:35  Fedayk1n: a vpn isn't even near a proxy
03:35  joobie: guys where can i download 4.2.1 iphoen firmware from the apple site? looked at http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1061 and it says to get it from itunes.. i want to download the ipsw file
03:35  jenkinz: http connections with a python script
03:35  MrUnagi: i was gonna say
03:35 +ChrisAM: write your script to use the proxy
03:36 +ChrisAM: there's probably a module that recognized the $HTTP_PROXY variable.
03:36  jenkinz: :O didnt think that
03:36 +ChrisAM: err recognizes
03:36  MrUnagi: omg something is making noise and i dunno what
03:36  MrUnagi: sounds like jenkinz wants to do some hacking
03:36  jenkinz: lol no
03:37  jenkinz: not ready for that
03:37  MrUnagi: that is exactly what a wannabe hacker would say!
03:37 --- dust--- is now known as dust--
03:37  jenkinz: really? :D
03:37  MrUnagi: someone that DOESNT wanna hack would be like 'yea man i got my private keys to break 256 bit encryption riding on a worm with a trojan, i got the pentagon last week'
03:38 +FriedBob: Of course then there are those who don't know what they are talking about...
03:38  MrUnagi: typically most wannabe hackers lol
03:39 +ChrisAM: I'm a wannabe hacker.
03:39  MrUnagi: yup
03:40  MrUnagi: get out of my firewall ChrisAM 
03:40 +FriedBob: Good, my proxy script worked.
03:41  MrUnagi: sudo rm -r /
03:41  MrUnagi: lol
03:42  MrUnagi: does that even work?
03:42 +ChrisAM: try it
03:42  MrUnagi: fno
03:42  remyo: I thought there needed to be an * in there 
03:42  MrUnagi: !g sudo rm -r /
03:42 +Securabot: 343,000 results | i typed 'sudo rm /* ' - Launchpad Answers @ https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/25672 | And what exactly will sudo rm -rf do? | tuxmachines.org @ http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/22428 | look what this idiot is trying to do... - MacTalk Forums @ http://forums.mactalk.com.au/8/42417-look-what-idiot-trying-do.html
03:42  MrUnagi: lol
03:43  MrUnagi: i typed 'sudo rm /* ' & now 7.10 not booting -" kernel panic " 
03:43  MrUnagi: haahha
03:43 * remyo always aliases rm to a message which tells me to mv to ~/.Treash instead 
03:43  MrUnagi: remyo: that is a good idea
03:43  MrUnagi: how do you empty trash via cli
03:44  MrUnagi: im a little sudo happy myself =/
03:44  MrUnagi: i need to stop doing that
03:44  remyo: rm -r ~/.Trash/* ? 
03:44  MrUnagi: sudo mkdir directory can be a pain when you forget that sudo makes the ownership root:root
03:44  MrUnagi: but this is coming from a guy that freshly understands how permissions work
03:45  MrUnagi: im gonna go into #ubuntu and tell people to type sudo rm -r /*.....ill be banned for sure
03:46  remyo: I dunno. rm just seems like a bad idea in general. It seems like by default it should send things to a Trash and there should be another command to empty that Trash
03:47 +FriedBob: I tend to alias rm to rm -i, at least for root.
03:47  MrUnagi: it is amazing that i havent lost anything drastic
03:47  MrUnagi: but then again i back up my system daily
03:47 +FriedBob: That way I can still use it, but for root, it will prompt me to make sure i actually want to delete each thing
03:48  MrUnagi: i have a cron job to say "I love you. You are so smart. You impress me every day." every 5 minutes
03:48  MrUnagi: it makes me feel worth something
03:49  MrUnagi: i <3 cron
03:49  MrUnagi: cron + rsync = why do we need any commercial backup softwarE?
03:49  remyo: Right on
03:49  MrUnagi: though i do admit i use CCC
03:50 +ChrisAM: MrUnagi ... does it pop up this image? http://media.schadenfreude.net/2009/06/stuart-smalley-posters.jpg
03:50  remyo: It still baffles my mind that so many systems primarily use ftp 
03:50  MrUnagi: ChrisAM: it will now
03:50 +ChrisAM: heh
03:50  MrUnagi: remyo: i use sftp.....what are you trying to say
03:51  MrUnagi: i love that xkcd comic........make me a sandwich
03:51  MrUnagi: no
03:51  MrUnagi: sudo make me a sandwich
03:51  MrUnagi: ok
03:51  remyo: MrUnagi: ssh and rsync just seem to much more convenient 
03:51  remyo: so much*
03:51  MrUnagi: remyo: not when you cant access the files from android
03:52  CPng|N: s/convenient/safe
03:52  MrUnagi: sftp is over ssh....
03:52  CPng|N: conventional ftp, like telnet, should probably have been deprecated by now
03:53  remyo: CPng|N: Sadly it's not 
03:53  MrUnagi: but sftp is just as secure as ssh right?
03:53  CPng|N: sftp is ssh
03:53  CPng|N: well, can be
03:53  CPng|N: it also beans SSL FTP
03:53  CPng|N: confusing term
03:54  CPng|N: either of which is encrypted and (can be) very safe
03:54  MrUnagi: hmmmm
03:55 +FriedBob: Key phrase there is "can be"
03:55  MrUnagi: when is sftp not ssh
03:55  Fedayk1n: when its scp
03:56  MrUnagi: scp is ssh is it not?
03:56  Fedayk1n: yeah true
03:56  Fedayk1n: hmmm
03:56  Fedayk1n: I'm sure there's a case
03:56 +FriedBob: ChrisAM: Will you let me know when there is music again an the interviews are over?
03:56 +ChrisAM: yeah
03:57  Fedayk1n: oh wait
03:57  CPng|N: scp is not ftp
03:57  Fedayk1n: yeah
03:57  joobie: hey guys.. is there a way to unlock those mac USB restore drives so that you can restore on any mac system? right now it detects that it's not a macbook air when i try to use it on a macmini and it stops me from using it..
03:57  Fedayk1n: sftp is not always ftp over ssh
03:57  CPng|N: scp is cp (copy) over ssh connection
03:57  jenkinz: maybe this :P  http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/how-to-set-proxy-for-terminal-quick.html 
03:57  Fedayk1n: sometimes its simple file transfer protocol
03:57  CPng|N: sftp has been used to descript ftp over ssh as well as ssl encrypted ftp, similar but different
03:57  CPng|N: oh yeah then there's that damn simple file xfer prot. lame
03:59  CPng|N: and when I say "can be", I mean anyone can dumb down for F up a security protocol and leave a huge hole open. but in general practice it's safe, and 99.99% of the time it's a safer bet than standard ftp.  but, it can be a nightmare in stuffy corporate environments
03:59  CPng|N: where they pretend that it's a PITA to properly set up certificates and open firewalls correctly
04:00 +ChrisAM: FriedBob ... Music is back
04:01 +FriedBob: ChrisAM: Sweet, the GnR song I was listening to just ended.
04:01 +ChrisAM: good timing
04:04 * ChrisAM is listening to Glitch.fm: The PolyBeat Plant (with @Sugarpill) streaming "Minnesota - Purple daze"
04:10  MrUnagi: so.....now that the verizon iphone is out
04:10  MrUnagi: i find myself depressed
04:10  MrUnagi: nothing to look forward to
04:11 +FriedBob: I have plenty to look forward to.
04:11  MrUnagi: but *I* don't
04:11 +FriedBob: Like 3 weeks of 12 hour days and a promotion.
04:11  MrUnagi: i wish i had a civilian job
04:12 +ChrisAM: get one
04:12 +FriedBob: I'd actually love to work for the federal government.
04:12  MrUnagi: will any of this dabbling with bash and scripting and networking and ssh and remote access get me a decent job?
04:12  MrUnagi: probably not
04:12  MrUnagi: im wasting my time huh
04:12 +FriedBob: But in the mean time, I do this.
04:12  CPng|N: it will help, but you usually need to know a lot more than just that
04:12  CPng|N: bash scripting is in a LOT of the job descriptions I'm looking at these days
04:12  MrUnagi: im doin what i can
04:13  MrUnagi: i also have some cisco knowledge
04:13  CPng|N: and I've had ssh related questions at a couple of interviews
04:13  MrUnagi: working on security+
04:13  MrUnagi: CPng|N: im not an expert in bash =(
04:13  MrUnagi: i mean i figured that script out earlier
04:14  MrUnagi: to dump ip addresses trying to access root into a text file and add those to iptables to drop
04:14  MrUnagi: thats impressive right?
04:14  MrUnagi: no? ok =(
04:14  CPng|N: I don't know if the jump between mid-level and expert will do all that much for you. as long as you can figure it out and/or understand it, modify scripts, make basic automation scripts etc
04:14  CPng|N: I'd say it is
04:14  MrUnagi: :D
04:15  CPng|N: it'd be a good example to remember in an interview
04:15  MrUnagi: this is true, maybe i need to keep a portfolio of the ones i make
04:15  CPng|N: it might not impress an senior level IT geek but it's impressive to others
04:15  CPng|N: not a bad idea
04:15  CPng|N: cuz doing that now is easier than going back years from now and trying to round that up
04:16  MrUnagi: i also have a cron job pulling the remote auth.log over scp
04:16  MrUnagi: its a bit more automated than mounting the remote file system
04:17  CPng|N: indeed
04:19  MrUnagi: i could probably write a script and put it in the ifup and ifdown, so that if there is not connection, to comment out the job in cron, so that it isnt constantly trying
04:19  MrUnagi: then when the network is up, uncomments the entry, downloads the log every 5 minutes
04:20  MrUnagi: h.264 dropping from chrome? thats a mistake
04:21  MrUnagi: CDMA iPad coming to Verizon, too, says CFO......i just wanna say i called this earlier
04:21  MrUnagi: someone replied to that earlier saying 'verizon already sells the ipad'........to which i give them a blank stare
04:32  CPng|N: iPad 2
04:32  MrUnagi: i like that pad
04:32  CPng|N: the VZW built-in iPad will be the ipad2
04:32  CPng|N: or at least, it would be completely ridiculous to make one for the original ipad when the new ipad will be released so close
04:33  Tomis: the iphone 5 is due soon
04:33  MrUnagi: june
04:34  Tomis: unless they're going to keep selling the iphone 4 for the next year
04:34  MrUnagi: i doubt it
04:34  Tomis: the verizon iphone pretty much hit the mark for when an update was due
04:34  MrUnagi: i dont think it cost them that much to do this phone
04:36  CPng|N: it's only slightly updated
04:36  CPng|N: iPhone 4.1
04:38  CPng|N: Windows 8 will apparently run on ARM
04:38  CPng|N: and nVidia will be making CPUs 
04:38  CPng|N: which will fail harder
04:39  Tomis: fail harder than what
04:40  CPng|N: the other
04:41  CPng|N: seems strange that nvidia is going to make cpu's but stop making chipsets, but maybe if I read up more on it, it would turn out to make perfect sense
04:41  CPng|N: I don't think I care to read about that crap any more tho. lol
04:49  MrUnagi: oooh i get the whole s/reference/thing/g now
04:49  MrUnagi: im learning about sed =)
04:50  MrUnagi: i think my script uses that
04:50 +FriedBob: ChrisAM: I'm trying to get some studying and testing done, so had to switch over to Ozzy and Pantera and Rammstein. I study better to that.
05:11  MrUnagi: so, i am starting to realize, most 'hacking' can be thwarted by secure passwords
05:12  Tomis: not really
05:13  MrUnagi: i cant do crap without passwords =/
05:13  Tomis: go to a website which exploits a severe rendering bug in your browser, executes arbitrary code, your whole OS just fell over
05:14  MrUnagi: i cant seem to enable screen sharing on my wifes mac throught terminal
05:14  Tomis: then walk over there and turn it on
05:15  MrUnagi: oh there it goes
05:15  MrUnagi: Tomis: im not at home
05:15  Tomis: probably should have enabled screen sharing before you left then, heh
05:15  MrUnagi: i got it :D
05:19  MrUnagi: lol
05:19  MrUnagi: i love freaking her out
05:21  CPng|N: next skipped message, send wednesday, december 10th, at 10, twenty, three, pee em.
05:21  Fedayk1n: the best,  is when you ssh over, and have it say things to her
05:22  CPng|N: lol i can't wait to do that
05:22  CPng|N: there are also phone apps to make the mac "say" things
05:22  CPng|N: so you can go take a crap and make everyone else join you!
05:23  MrUnagi: Fedayk1n: thats part of it
05:23  MrUnagi: i just watched her on facebook and made alex say what she posted on her wall
05:23  MrUnagi: and then i opened *.jpg in her pictures folder lol
05:24  CPng|N: heh
05:24  MrUnagi: :D
05:24  Fedayk1n: just ssh over,  and type "say -v alex you sure have a pretty mouth"
05:24  Tomis: she's think she has a virus
05:24  Tomis: and then you'll be buying her a PC next
05:25  MrUnagi: she knows better than that
05:25  CPng|N: hahhahha
05:25  Tomis: becuase she insists the mac is virus prone
05:25  Tomis: you're really only hurting yoursef
05:25  CPng|N: I feel sorry for someone who thinks a pc will be more secure
05:25  CPng|N: man that would ruin your digital life
05:25  CPng|N: onoz
05:26  MrUnagi: :D
05:35  MrUnagi: hmmm.....next i think i wanna figure out how to stream video over udp securely
05:36  Tomis: what sort of video
05:38  MrUnagi: from usb cam
05:38  MrUnagi: i like to keep things light without 3rd party apps
05:45 --- nav_ is now known as navs
05:45  MrUnagi: right now i can see her with photobooth through vnc
05:48  Tomis: why not just use ichat, lol
05:48  navs: without the context that sounds somewhat creepy
05:48  MrUnagi: Tomis: believe it or not i think ichat has more overhead
05:49  MrUnagi: and definitely less control
05:49  Tomis: i suspect ichat would be more efficient
05:49  Fedayk1n: the trick is snapping an image without turning on the green indicator led
05:49  MrUnagi: with vnc i can compress, and make it grayscale
05:49  Tomis: ichat uses h264 compression, and scales the quality with the available bandwidth
05:49  MrUnagi: Tomis: not over 3g
05:50  MrUnagi: right but id rather sacrifice framerate than quality
05:50  Tomis: ARD uses what appears to be JPEG compression
05:50  Tomis: massively inferior for the purpose of video
05:50  MrUnagi: works for me :D
05:52  fujisan: hey
05:52  MrUnagi: HEY!
05:52  CPng|N: shh
05:52  fujisan: how well does dosbox run on os x?
05:53  CPng|N: dosbox?
05:53  fujisan: i really need to play this old game again :<
05:53  MrUnagi: ran fine for me
05:53  CPng|N: as in DOS as in disk operating system?
05:53  fujisan: dosbox
05:53  CPng|N: really need to huh
05:53  eva_02: guys, can you help me with little offtopic thing 
05:53  CPng|N: which game
05:53  fujisan: http://www.dosbox.com/
05:53  fujisan: Little Big Adventure
05:53  Tomis: wait a day or two, then give her a call eva_02

05:56  CPng|N: glooorious
05:56  MrUnagi: lol
05:56  navs: I shuddered a little at the thought of a DOS emulator being the best OS X app eva
05:56  CPng|N: ya no kidding
05:57  eva_02: i need a USA phone number for sms verification in craigslist
05:57  MrUnagi: sounds like a scam
05:57  eva_02: nono
05:57  MrUnagi: sudo checkscam eva_02
05:57  MrUnagi: yep.....its a scam
05:57  Tomis: then get a $20 perpaid thing eva_02

05:58  MrUnagi: CPng|N: requires a us  number
05:58  CPng|N: wait that probaly wouldn't solve a thing
05:58  CPng|N: ya
05:58  eva_02: for one year
05:58  Tomis: who is this craig, and do you really trust his list?
05:58  fujisan: navs that's cause you never played 'Little Big Adventure'
05:58  MrUnagi: lol
05:58  MrUnagi: lol Tomis 
05:58  CPng|N: kings quest > LBA
05:58  Tomis: why would i want access to your box for a year
05:58  navs: oh i havent?
05:58  eva_02: Tomis: dunno, i hear that he is old man 
05:58  fujisan: CPng|N:  for which platform and have you actually played LBA?
05:58  MrUnagi: is it like chindler's list?
05:58  CPng|N: for which platform??
05:59  MrUnagi: because you don't wanna be on that list
05:59  Tomis:  chandaleir list
05:59  CPng|N: there were no platforms back then
05:59  CPng|N: there was pc. and, pc jr
05:59  fujisan: kings quest for which platform
05:59  CPng|N: and black and white macs with 3 games

05:59  Tomis: so i have this tortillas, that came in a ziplock bag
05:59  MrUnagi: Tomis: i thought i got it wrong
05:59  Tomis: with the text "PRESS TO RE-CLOSE"
05:59  CPng|N: Some call me......           Tim
06:00  CPng|N: press'n'drag
06:00  fujisan: guys i am going to enjoy dosbox
06:00  CPng|N: guy ok
06:00  Tomis: does that a little redundant to anyone?
06:00  fujisan: it's great for retrogaming
06:00  Tomis: re-close?
06:00  fujisan: os x is the best os to run dosbox on
06:00  CPng|N: it was closed. until you opened it
06:00  CPng|N: now you want to reclose it
06:00  Tomis: but the previous state was open
06:00  navs: no different than re-open
06:00  Tomis: now i want it closed
06:01  fujisan: because dos and os x share their common ancestry namely the underlying lynchpin the unix underpinnings 
06:01  CPng|N: so actually yes. the first time you close it, it's wrong. it's after your' 2nd toritlla that it's right
06:01  Tomis: lol fujisan 
06:01  fujisan: :)
06:02  CPng|N: dos doesn't share much unix underpinning
06:02  CPng|N: aside from "cd"
06:02  MrUnagi: lol
06:02  MrUnagi: does dos share any?
06:02  CPng|N: not even "dir"
06:02  MrUnagi: why do they continue with the same bs structure
06:02  MrUnagi: why dont they rewrite it
06:02  CPng|N: rewrite what
06:02  fujisan: http://www.darkflame.co.uk/Swede/Blipstream.html
06:02  CPng|N: there is no DOS
06:02  MrUnagi: CPng|N: windows
06:03  CPng|N: windows != dos
06:03  MrUnagi: i know this...
06:03  Tomis: windows is DOS
06:03  Tomis: i dont' care what MS claims
06:03  MrUnagi: nevermind, i dont feel like having this convo
06:03  Tomis: hey've only gotten better at hiding it
06:03  CPng|N: nor do I
06:03  CPng|N: lol!
06:03  Tomis: they've lied before, they will lie again

06:04  Tomis: the kinect is awesome
06:04  Tomis: mac needs one built in
06:04  CPng|N: that it is

06:04  Tomis: best gam system ever
06:04  MrUnagi: i guess we are missing my point
06:04  CPng|N: they should sell office, AD, and kinect. and stop all this other nonsense
06:05  Tomis: they should buy yahoo
06:05  Tomis: and shut it down
06:05  CPng|N: yes
06:05  CPng|N: please
06:05  Tomis: and give the moeny back to the shareholders

06:05  CPng|N: "sorry. we tried for a while but.. uh.. well, here."

06:06  Tomis: how can you not beleive in yourself
06:06  Tomis: that's so sad
06:06  MrUnagi: ?
06:06  navs: if MS bought facebook they'd surely muck it up and then there would be no facebook and I could contact friends through email like it should be done
06:06  CPng|N: so copying 3 files is all it takes to hack up a mac app store app?
06:07  torchie: osx has a pretty hott dosbox app

06:07  MrUnagi: is dosbox in the app store?
06:07  torchie: prob not
06:08  CPng|N: ah
06:08  CPng|N: regardless, it surely won't last
06:08  CPng|N: not that you really need or should be using MAS if you're that type of person
06:09  Tomis: anyone doing that surely has no problem just downloading a pre-hacked version of the game
06:09  CPng|N: exactly
06:09  CPng|N: I notice you say game
06:09  CPng|N: lol
06:11  CPng|N: hmm. you can buy the iLife 11 apps separately. for $15 ea. not shabby
06:11  Tomis: kinda crappy actually
06:11  Tomis: it'll drive down the price of 3rd party apps
06:11  CPng|N: true

06:11  CPng|N: ya
06:11  MrUnagi: apple is trying to kill me
06:11  torchie: yeah what the hell
06:11  CPng|N: though at the same time some apps need to be driven down. 
06:12  MrUnagi: not because i am a developer, but because i smell like cheese
06:12  Tomis: stinky cheese man!
06:12  MrUnagi: i want an ipad arm band
06:12  CPng|N: lol
06:12  CPng|N: that product sounds like a loss for the developer
06:12  Tomis: make a viral video about it MrUnagi 
06:12  MrUnagi: do they make them?
06:12  CPng|N: yes
06:13  CPng|N: well, supposedly
06:13  MrUnagi: about cheese? or an ipad armband
06:13  CPng|N: they NOT being apple
06:13  CPng|N: ipad armband
06:13  MrUnagi: it will be the best selling product ever
06:14  Tomis: the iPad already has an ARM inside it though
06:14  Tomis: so does tht mean the iPad needs a band in it too?
06:14  CPng|N: hmm. It hought someone made one, but can't find it now. maybe it was a joke after all. could swear I saw a real product for sale a few months ago
06:14  MrUnagi: i shall make it
06:14  MrUnagi: it will be epic

10:09  db8: hello
10:09  LSD`: o/
10:09  db8: could someone please help me, i am new to mac and a friend of mine has done something
10:10  db8: they inserted a removable drive into a mac, dragged a dropped 23folders residing on the mac's HDD onto the removable drive - What does that mean - have they moved the folders to the removable drive or have they copied them?
10:10 --- Tomis2 is now known as Tomis
10:11  S_SubZero: If they disappear from the source, they are moved.  If they do not disappear from the source, they are copied.
10:12  db8: problem is the folders have subfolders in them, if the root folders have NOT disappeared could it still be the case that they have been half copied half moved?
10:12  LSD`: OS X will indicate it's about to copy something by placing a white cross in a green circle on the file icons when you're hovering over a destination. It usually defaults to moving when you're going between two folders on the same drive and copy from removable drives
10:13  db8: ic
10:13  db8: well all i know is that the mac used is running the latest version of the MAC OS
10:13  LSD`: db8: you haven't tried copying files/folders into one that has several with the same names, right? OS X doesn't like that. It'll overwrite the old with the new and not "merge" them like viortually every other OS/UI
10:14  db8: oh no
10:14  Fedayk1n: LSD`: uh, most OS's don't merge
10:14  Fedayk1n: most over-write
10:14  db8: just 23folders on the HDD have been dragged and dropped onto clean removable hdd
10:14  cryptics_: win7 is the only one i've seen ask about merging
10:15  LSD`: Fedayk1n: files yes, folders no
10:15  db8: what im worried about is if this action makes some wierd move-copy operation whereby most files have been moved from the HDD and only a small amount has remained
10:16  LSD`: cryptics_: every version of Windows I've used will merges directory tress on copying
10:16  db8: i dont understand why MACs are wierd like that
10:16  db8: or if they a wierd like that
10:18  LSD`: If you have Folder1 with FileX and FileY in it and then copy it to another drive that also has a "Folder1" in it, but with FileA and FileB, most will simply copy in FileX and FileY beside FileA and FileB and be done with it. OS X (and possibly every version of Finder as well) will overwrite the Folder1 in the destination nuking FileA and FileB in the process
10:20  db8: if on the removable HDD there are no folders whatsoever and you drag and drop 23 folders from the MAC HDD, does anyone know if the result would be deterministic and not unknown

12:42  db8: by default when you copy a file from a MAC does the file indicate its been copied?
12:42  Tomis: no db8 
12:42  db8: yesturday i was using a MAC for the first time
12:42  db8: i remember copying some files
12:43  Tomis: do a search for recently create/modified files
12:43  db8: but when you copy a file to a removable disk?
12:44  db8: i copied the files from the HDD to a removable disk
12:44  Tomis: again, do a search i nhe finder
12:44  db8: what will the finder do?
12:44  MrUnagi: omg im so tired
12:44  Tomis: find the files if you search for them, lol
12:45  db8: i dont have a mac infront of me
12:45  MrUnagi: find it
12:45  MrUnagi: uh oh
12:45  Tomis: then what's your question?
12:45  Fedayk1n: wow samson's new usb mic is pretty nice
12:45  Tomis: search the disk from whatever OS you're on
12:45  db8: no i mean it will list the files which have recently been copied?
12:45  Tomis: try it and find out
12:46  MrUnagi: on engadget eh Fedayk1n 
12:46  Fedayk1n: yeah NNW went off :D
12:46  MrUnagi: 2 more hours
12:47  MrUnagi: 2 more loooong hours
12:48  db8: Tomis: ok, if i search for files that have recently been created/modified i will get a list of files that have recently been created or changed in some way on the HDD, however if i coped file Hello.txt from the HDD onto a USB flash drive, removed the flash drive and then I performed the search you said - it will not list Hello.txt as recently created/modified will it???? how has that file been modified?
12:49  Tomis: try it and find out
12:49  Fedayk1n: db8 your mac won't do what you're looking for without specialized software
12:49  Tomis: doing a file copy won't modify the original, no
12:49  MrUnagi: what about foo.txt
12:49  Fedayk1n: so no
12:49  Tomis: it may change the "last opened" date, but i doubt it
12:49  MrUnagi: these are not the droids you are looking for
12:50  db8: Tomis: i see so you need specialised software for this?
12:50  MrUnagi: i still dunno what db8 is trying to do
12:51  Tomis: no db8 
12:51  Tomis: just run a search with the right parameters
12:51  Tomis: and see what you get
12:51  Fedayk1n: sounds like he's trying to track filesystem history
12:51  Tomis: yea, there's nothing that logs when you copied a file
12:51  MrUnagi: im going to invent one
12:51  Tomis: it would be easier to just search the destination disk for newly created files
12:51  Fedayk1n: MrUnagi: they exist
12:52  MrUnagi: shhhhh
12:52  MrUnagi: let me dream
12:52  db8: ok, say i shared a folder on my MAC, on it i have to files 1.txt and 2.txt, if you connected to my shared folder and copied 1.txt onto your drive, will I on my MAC be able to know which file you copied?? thats what im trying to find out?
12:52  Fedayk1n: go for it,  invent a new one.   server watchdog software is a pretty good racket
12:52  Tomis: no db8 
12:52  MrUnagi: i havent come across a log like that
12:52  MrUnagi: that would be nice
12:52  Tomis: you will have no record of what files were accessed and copied
12:52  Fedayk1n: actually..  yes you can dig up that information
12:53  MrUnagi: Fedayk1n: how
12:53  db8: how?
12:53  MrUnagi: how?
12:53  Fedayk1n: god now you're gonna make me go through my bash history
12:53  Tomis: you could run a program to watch file system access
12:53  MrUnagi: lol
12:53  Tomis: but there's nothing built-in to do it
12:53  MrUnagi: you could run windows in parallels
12:53  Fedayk1n: yeah the app that outs the information isn't really in engrish
12:53  MrUnagi: but that wouldn't solve your problem
12:53  Tomis: lol
12:53  MrUnagi: =)
12:54  MrUnagi: forgive men, i have been at work for 22 hours
12:54  MrUnagi: s/men/me
12:55  Fedayk1n: you can get the info via fs_usage
12:55  Fedayk1n: but good luck sorting through it all
12:56  Fedayk1n: and to get the information you want out of it,  you will probably need to modify the runtime rules of it so it tracks it
12:57  MrUnagi: omg why does my terminal keep telling me i have new mail
12:57  Fedayk1n: MrUnagi: because you do
12:57  MrUnagi: where???
12:57  MrUnagi: mail.app?
12:57  Fedayk1n: localhost?
12:57  Tomis: lol
12:57  MrUnagi: i have never seen it do that before

13:46  Keshi: Forgot to switch the input method back.
13:48  MrUnagi: tired
13:49  Keshi: Oh okay, aye. Me too, I've been awake quite a while now.
13:50  Keshi: I had meant to for all interested BTW, I found out the answer to that move app appstore thing.
13:50  MrUnagi: ive been awake for 25 hours
13:51  Keshi: It seems to work fine. I moved TextWrangler into /Application/Utilities and it update to version 3.5.2 from 3.5.1.
13:51  Keshi: Yes, I have been awake since 5PM yesterday, when I woke up from a two hour nap. It is now 10 to midnight.
13:52  Keshi: So I guess that is close to 32 hours.
13:52  Keshi: Why is IRC full of people with crazy sleeping patterns?
13:54  MrUnagi: i am on a 24 hour shift
13:55  Keshi: Oh okay, aye. I would recommend trying to get away from that.
13:55  Keshi: I am just an insomniac basically.

14:07  shuaib: So is there a channel around dedicated to "darwin" issues (compiling etc)? Both #darwin and #xnu are empty
14:08  shuaib: Or should I direct my questions related to kernel to this channel ;)
14:11 +ChrisAM: you can ask.. if someone knows the answer, they'll respond.
14:12  shuaib: ChrisAM: cool, thanks
14:13  shuaib: So has anyone tried compiling xnu with GCC version>4.0? apple's documentation refers to version 10.6.4 of kernel and says it should be build with gcc version 3.3
14:13  shuaib: Not sure if the same is true for latest versions of xnu
14:15  Keshi: What is "darwin ports"?
14:23 +crilly|w: Keshi, it a package manager like system for compiling the source code of various applications that have been ported to OS X (which is based on the Darwin kernel).
14:31  jessd: Hey, has anyone here found a way to map a key in Remote Desktop for Mac Os to the Windows Key?  I'm snowbound working from home today, and it would be very beneficial to do this.  Google fails me on this one.
14:32 +crilly|w: "key"?
14:33  Keshi: It is much like the freebsd ports system?
14:33  jessd: +crilly|w : Yep, a keyboard key.  Perferably one I don't use, like caps lock
14:33  jessd: s/Perf/Pref/
14:33 +crilly|w: Ah right.
14:34 +crilly|w: I'm not sure, jessd. Are you using an RDP client?
14:34 +crilly|w: Keshi, kind of yeah, but not as comprehensive. 
14:35  jessd: +crilly|w : Yep, using RDC from Microsoft.  I've not found anything else.  
14:35  Fedayk1n: use CoRD MUCH better than RDC
14:35  jessd: Fedak1n : Ah, /me looks
14:37 +crilly|w: Yeah look at CoRD.
14:38  jessd: .. and that does the trick.  Awesome, thank you Fedayk1n and +crilly|w
14:39  Fedayk1n: no worries
14:46 +crilly|w: :)

16:42  MobGod: pgpkeys Skype 
16:43  Tomis: archive the folder, then email it to him or whatever MobGod 
16:43  bisu[Shield]: does this channel help with os x problems
16:43  Tomis: in finder, file>archive
16:43  pgpkeys: zip the file to get around any limits in skype's safe file sending, then right click his name in skype and select send file.. and select the file to send him
16:44  pgpkeys: done/done once he accepts
16:45  MobGod: ok thanks guys 
16:45  MobGod: does iweb save as html 
16:45  MobGod: what does it save as ?
16:46  pgpkeys: i thought iweb allowed you to export as html
16:46  pgpkeys: File menu, export or save as 
16:47  Tomis: yes, html, of course
16:47  Tomis: that's its whole purpose
16:47  Tomis: but if you want all the various image and other crap included, you need to archive it
16:48  HackeMate: what is the equivalent to clonecd?
16:48  HackeMate: with its same features
16:48  Tomis: what does clonecd do
16:48  HackeMate: hm?
16:49  HackeMate: cloning cds with copyright (games backup)
16:49  Tomis: just make a disk image
16:49  Tomis: in disk utility
16:50  HackeMate: but those cds sometimes are protected and they trhow errors to mess up the burner software
16:50  HackeMate: clonecd ust ignore those things

16:57 +zer0her0: ChrisAM: weird, i know he moved and didn't, possibly still doesn't, have internet at his new place other then via his cell
17:02  pgpkeys: i just pulled inet off my cell. too expensive 
17:04 +ChrisAM: mobile internet is just a fad anyway
17:05  pgpkeys: i was only using it when i needed to look something up real fast or wanted to browse FB.
17:05  pgpkeys: not important enough to keep
17:05  webPragmatist: can you do wildcards in hosts?
17:06  pgpkeys: not for assignment
17:06  pgpkeys: nor can you *.host.com in hosts file
17:06  pgpkeys: which sucks because then it would be easy to 127.0.0.1 *.adserver.com 
17:08  pgpkeys: tomis are there commandline tools for working with Mac OS X (desktop) firewall? like iptables or pf?
17:08 * pgpkeys realizes he really should be reading the Apple Training Series Mac OS X 10.6 Support Essentials book
17:09  Tomis: yea there is pgpkeys , it's called something or other
17:09  pgpkeys: hahaha
17:09  Tomis: then they switched to using something else
17:10 * pgpkeys grins and gives tomis the finger ;)
17:10  Tomis: so it has two firewall systems now
17:10  Tomis: check out Water Roof, it's a GUI to the firewall system
17:10  pgpkeys: googling. thanks
17:11 +zer0her0: 10.6 Support Essentials: Have you tried turning it off and on again? Is it plugged in?
17:12 * pgpkeys snickers
