16:12  LaraX: hi zer0her0
16:12  zer0her0: LaraX: hello
16:13  LaraX: zer0her0: you said the display MacBook Air 11" had 4GB, right? but I don't know if you told me if they sold them like that at the store. I might get one tomorrow or this weekend
16:14  LaraX: 4G RAM*
16:15  zer0her0: no i said it was the higher end MBA 11 inch
16:15  crilly: They sell MBA 11" with 4GB of RAM, yes.
16:15  zer0her0: 128GB flash & 2GB RAM
16:15  LaraX: but higher end meaning what?
16:15  LaraX: oh
16:15  crilly: More storage.
16:15  zer0her0: yea
16:15  LaraX: crilly: I know, I'm asking if they have the 4GB RAM in stores or you have to get it in the mail
16:15  zer0her0: all the models we have in the store only have 2GB
16:15  zer0her0: which is lame
16:15  LaraX: I don't need storage
16:16  crilly: You can't it after market LaraX 
16:16  LaraX: zer0her0: I see
16:16  LaraX: crilly: I know
16:16  LaraX: so I guess I have to get it in the mail then if I want 4GB
16:16  LaraX: RAM
16:16  crilly: Oh I see your (weakly worded) point. Well if they have to order one in, I guess they will.
16:16  crilly: I want a MBA too :(
16:17  LaraX: that's not what I was asking either. I'm trying to decide whether I'm going to get it from a store or Apple's site
16:17  LaraX: depending on what or isn't sold at the store
16:17  LaraX: is or isn't*
16:18  zer0her0: i'm still not sure if i want a MBA
16:18  LaraX: http://www.cultofmac.com/11-inch-macbook-air-first-impression-its-freakin-fast
16:19  crilly: I want the 11" so I can throw it in my bag and take to work and mate's houses it.
16:19  crilly: etc*
16:19  zer0her0: crilly: but that's what my 21" game laptop is for
16:19  zer0her0: well throw it in the wheelbarrow
16:21  LaraX: zer0her0: if you got one which one would it be?
16:21  crilly: he likes them long and black
16:21  crilly: and think
16:21  crilly: thick*
16:22  zer0her0: hey now
16:22  LaraX: they don't come in black... I wish!
16:22  crilly: So erm... the vibrating one i guess
16:22 * zer0her0 shakes head
16:22  crilly: ;P
16:22  zer0her0: hehe
16:22  LaraX: well iPhones vibrate
16:22  LaraX: right?
16:22  zer0her0: PG friendly people!!
16:22  zer0her0: :P
16:22  LaraX: tell him that :p
16:23  zer0her0: i'd prob get the low end 11" w/ 4GB RAM
16:23  LaraX: so you'd have to get it from Apple's site too right?
16:23  LaraX: I didn't want to get anything in the mail, I wanted to pick it up at a store
16:23  zer0her0: well i have to get all my equipment from apple's site
16:23  zer0her0: :(
16:24  LaraX: I have a MobileMe trial right now, I can order it with my credit card info there right? since it's also an Apple ID or whatever
16:25  zer0her0: yes you can order it in the store
16:25  zer0her0: but it has to be shipped to your house
16:25  LaraX: oh
16:25  LaraX: do you know how long it might take?
16:26 * zer0her0 calls up the factory
16:26  LaraX: it's ok, I can find out
16:26  zer0her0: shit i forget if they speak mandarin or cantonese
16:26  zer0her0: ah it's cantonese
16:26  zer0her0: they say 1 to 3 days
16:26  zer0her0: ;)
16:26  LaraX: you're really going to call China? :p
16:27  LaraX: you did already?
16:27  zer0her0: either i called up china and spoke cantonese or i went to store.apple.com and looked at shipping time when i selected the macbook air
16:27  zer0her0: ;)
16:27  crilly: ;]
16:27  LaraX: well I did say I can find out, but thanks anyway :) I thought you might know offhand
16:27 * crilly rolls his eyes
16:28  crilly: women.
16:28  LaraX: ...
16:28  LaraX: don't start
16:28 * zer0her0 stays far away from crilly for when LaraX attacks
16:28  LaraX: he always acts like that
16:28  zer0her0: haha
16:29  LaraX: :|
16:29  zer0her0: ?
16:30  Tu13es: hm, you can put 4gb in the lowest end 11"
16:30  Tu13es: with 64gb
16:30  crilly: ;P
16:30  crilly: Tu13es: yeah I think so
16:30  FriedBob: LaraX: Do you prefer blades or automatic weapons?
16:30  crilly: don't see why not
16:30  Tu13es: i guess i just misread zer0her0 
16:31  LaraX: FriedBob: I'll use both on him
16:31  zer0her0: Tu13es: yea i downgraded from 64 to 4
16:31  zer0her0: ftw
16:31  Tu13es: nice
16:32  crilly: lol
16:32  FriedBob: LaraX: Chainsaw bayonett on an automatic rifle? :)
16:33  zer0her0: FriedBob: thanks Gears of War
16:33  crilly: indeed
16:33  FriedBob: zer0her0: So? It's an awesome idea, and I have seen a few people who have real ones - some that function.
16:34  zer0her0: it's not an awesome idea
16:34  zer0her0: do you know how quickly your gun would get jammed due to miscellaneous bits of human?
16:35  FriedBob: Depends on how it was engineered.
16:36  LaraX: FriedBob: all of the above ;)
16:36  crilly: zer0her0: We need a ##mac minecraft server :P
16:36  crilly: It woul be awesome

17:21  jazzyb: Hello all,
17:21  LaraX: hi
17:22  jazzyb: I never installed or used Mac OS X, and i have barely used it. Just wondering how the licencing work for it.
17:23  jazzyb: Dose mac use Serial Keys like Windows? are the OEM keys stuck to the Machine like windows? Are there even OEM keys?
17:24  zer0her0: jazzyb: mac only works on mac
17:25  jazzyb: I know. I am thinking of getting a second hand Mac. 
17:26  zer0her0: ah ok
17:26  zer0her0: in that case no apple "trusts you"
17:26  jazzyb: If i do, I would like format and install a fresh copy of the OS. So just wondering how the licencing works.
17:26  zer0her0: no serial #s on anything but their apps that cost over a grand
17:26  crilly: jazzyb: If you want to try the latest version of OS X, you will need an Intel based Mac.
17:26  zer0her0: good catch
17:26  zer0her0: though thankfully PPC macs are all but dead
17:26  zer0her0: though i miss em
17:27  jazzyb: OK. Cool, thanks for your help.
17:27  crilly: jazzyb: And if you want to try OS X, you will need a Mac end of. So, you need a Mac to use OS X and you need an Intel Mac to use Snow Leopard. If you buy a Mac with 10.5 on it, then you can buy Snow Leopard (10.6), which will basically upgrade 10.5 to 10.6 for you.
17:28  jazzyb: It is an old PPC mac i am thinking of getting :-(
17:28  jazzyb: I would like an Inetl one - but it is too expensive for me.
17:29  zer0her0: jazzyb: PPC only lets you get up to 10.5 and there is a bunch of software that won't run
17:29  zer0her0: it's more a less a dead end road unless you're really gung ho about PPC stuff
17:29  jazzyb: OK 10.5 will be good enough for me to learn on, and my needs.
17:30  jazzyb: Take it Mac OS x has no rubbish like - Microsoft Genuine Advantage 
17:34  jazzyb: OK. Thanks for you help Zer0Her0, crilly.
17:34  zer0her0: jazzyb: not currently
17:34  zer0her0: and your welcome
17:34  jazzyb: Have a good day all.
17:34  ichdertom: this microsoft license thingy is just silly. lots of pcs using a unlicensed copy spread viruses and spam mails 'cause they don't have any security updates
17:34  jazzyb: Thanks again. :-)

18:19  zer0her0: nice, what client do you use?
18:20  danl: the only good one
18:20  danl: irssi
18:20  danl: now she quit
18:21 * danl pokes Lara extra hard
18:21  zer0her0: you mind sharing how you do that?
18:21  danl: do what?
18:21  FriedBob: zer0her0: Get your mind out the gutter
18:22  crilly: zer0her0: If you used Textual, I could write a plugin for you in ObjC.
18:22  zer0her0: the regex stuff
18:22  zer0her0: i use irssi
18:22  danl: oh easy peasy
18:22  FriedBob: macirssi here
18:23  crilly: yeah with irssi it's as easy as asking bashusr for his script which does that :P
18:23  zer0her0: true
18:23  zer0her0: i should jsut do that
18:23  jeremyw: irssi
18:23  danl:  /hilight -regexp thereg.+ex.*here

20:42  tasslehoff: A friend of mine has bought the iPhone 4. Is there a way to transfer paid apps from iPhone 3GS to iPhone 4?
20:44  claude2: tasslehoff: yeah itunes will automatically move everything over
20:45  claude2: you can restore the iphone 4 from the last backup from the 3gs, so the settings and everything will get migrated to the new one
20:45  RenegadeWut: I have a weird problem dudes, my keyboards works but the Character keys (Any thing used to format and type characters)
20:46  tasslehoff: claude2: yeah, that's what I thought too, but he claims everything but the apps was restored
20:46  claude2: they might be disabled for some reason....
20:46  claude2: with the phone connected to itunes, if you click on the phone, then click the apps button
20:46  RenegadeWut: And my mouse can move, but not click or interact (I.e mouse overs or hot corners)
20:46  claude2: he can make sure they are checked off
20:47  claude2: RenegadeWut: make sure you have the right keyboard mapping set maybe?
20:47  RenegadeWut: Anyone any ideas? I'm getting really worried :(
20:47  claude2: it might be set to the wrong language
20:47  zer0her0: he may have sync apps turned off
20:47  zer0her0: seems to happen if people only buy apps on their phone
20:48  RenegadeWut: claude2: Sorry, could you elaborate?

20:58  yoluca: hi all
20:59  kithpom: test
20:59  yoluca: im planning to buy me a MacBook Pro 15-inch ... now ... should i got for the i5 or i7 core ... ? 
20:59  S_SubZero: you should get the i5
20:59  yoluca: why ?
20:59  zer0her0: iX
20:59  S_SubZero: fives are more friendly looking numbers
21:00  S_SubZero: rounded and such
21:00  yoluca: lol
21:00  jeremyw: Because 5 is my favorite number
21:00  kithpom: yoluca: what do you intend to do with it?
21:00  yoluca: kithpom nothing special .. just home user ... 
21:00  RenegadeWut: Alright got my mouse working
21:00  yoluca: i just heard that the i7 gets really hot ... is that right ?
21:01  RenegadeWut: But why is my keyboard characters not? 
21:01  RenegadeWut: Anyone? I will literally try anything at this point
21:02  S_SubZero: try another keyboard
21:03  RenegadeWut: Well I don't have that resouce t the minute
21:03  RenegadeWut: At*
21:03  jeremyw: Check your keyboard setup in System Preferences
21:03  S_SubZero: reboot, reseat, uh.. shake it?
21:03  RenegadeWut: Is there a shortcut that I may have pressed to disable your keyboard
21:04  RenegadeWut: S_SubZero: the keyboard works, just not the characters
21:04  jeremyw: Check your settings, like I suggested.
21:04  RenegadeWut: Please don't try to be funny
21:04  S_SubZero: try tapping all of them several times.  My PC laptop's CTRL key sometimes sticks and it causes the keyboard to act strangely.
21:04  RenegadeWut: jeremyw: Any setting in particular
21:05  kithpom: S_SubZero: I find that happens alot with usb keyboards.
21:05  yoluca: MBPro 15-inch 2.66GHz Intel Core i7 with 128 ssd and NVIDIA GT 330M with 512 MB  VS 
21:05  yoluca: MBPro 15-inch 2.53GHz Intel Core i5 with 128 ssd and NVIDIA GT 330M with 256 MB 
21:05  S_SubZero: yoluca: I believe we already covered this topic.
21:05  yoluca: will the i7 woth the £150 extra ?
21:06  kithpom: yoluca: is using an ssd you might go with the i7. hard drive would be bottleneck otherwise. you really as just plain home user would have no need for it though.
21:07  kithpom: yoluca: how much extra are you paying for the ssd?
21:07  yoluca: kithpom would you spend a bit extra and get the i7 with ssd ?
21:07  yoluca: £ 160 for 128 ssd 
21:08  yoluca: 2.66GHz vs 2.53GHz   dont even notice :))
21:08  kithpom: yoluca: the i5 is dual and the i7 is quad?
21:08  yoluca: no clue 
21:09  yoluca: on the website it says botch dual ... but i think ..both quad 
21:09  S_SubZero: no Apple uses the dual core i7's
21:09  yoluca: is it ? hmm
21:09  S_SubZero: the true quad i7 mobiles are significantly lower speed.
21:09  yoluca: Enjoy incredible performance from the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, which features two processor cores on a single chip.
21:09  S_SubZero: like 1.7Ghz or whatever
21:10  yoluca: yeah u right 
21:11  kithpom: yoluca: that sucks that for you in uk ssd is $50 more than an upgrade in US
21:11  yoluca: so what now ... is it worth spending £ 150 more and get the i7 ? ... or better save the £150 , get the i5 and upgrade it to 8GB ?
21:11  S_SubZero: 8GB for a "home user" really?  
21:11  kithpom: yoluca: doing any virtualization like vmware fusion or parallels?
21:12  yoluca: S_SubZero yeah ...vmware 
21:12  yoluca: upps kithpom ^
21:12  kithpom: yoluca: more than one vm at a time?
21:12  yoluca: 4-5
21:12  yoluca: and  lots of remote 
21:13  kithpom: ouch. in that case i would say go with the i7 and the 8gb if you can.
21:13  S_SubZero: and what part of 4-5 VM's is "home user"  @.@
21:13  yoluca: S_SubZero :)
21:13  kithpom: S_SubZero: the part where it isn't
21:13  yoluca: ok lets say ...i will use it for a bit of both :)
21:13  yoluca: so ...get the i7 ...and in the future upgrade to 8 gb 
21:13  yoluca: thank ....you 
21:14  yoluca: i will indeed do that 
21:14  claude2: right, you can always upgrade ram later
21:18  yoluca: just hopping that from the advertised 8-9 hours of battery life ... i will get at least 5 :)

21:36  yoluca: kithpom thanks
21:36  kithpom: yoluca: it looks like the suggestion there could be to go with the i5.
21:38 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
21:50  yoluca: I'd still suggest opting for an SSD before considering any CPU upgrades, but if you're looking to keep your new MacBook Pro for a while the Core i7 is worth it.
21:58  yoluca: wooow mac are very expensive :))
21:59  yoluca: for the same price i can get a nice vaio ....

22:00  CEnTR4L: Get your "nice" vaio then.
22:00  yoluca: wow
22:00  yoluca: really love the mbp ... but come one mate ... look at the specs i get with the vaio 
22:01  Tu13es: there's more to a Mac than specs
22:01  yoluca: like what ?
22:01  Tu13es: Mac OS
22:01  yoluca: im paying so much extra just for the look ...
22:01  Tu13es: build quality, reliability, warranty, etc.
22:01  Tu13es: I gladly pay more to be able to run Mac OS
22:02  Tsavo: OS X is the only reason I have a Mac
22:02  yoluca: there is hackintosh remember ? :)
22:02  Tu13es: sure, but the legality of it is questionable, and it never *just works*
22:02  b3ny0-: yes, but it seldom works as well
22:02  Tu13es: and that's really the main reason I'm okay with paying more
22:02  b3ny0-: and besides, Channel rules: Play nice, no hackintosh & English only
22:02  b3ny0-: ;)
22:02  Tu13es: yep
22:02  yoluca: :)
22:02  yoluca: sure 
22:03  yoluca: really confused now... 
22:03  b3ny0-: don't get me wrong, I'm no mac-fanatic and I have no problem with people using hacks, but its what the channel sez
22:04  yoluca: i own a vaio ... never had a mac before ... really want to get one ... dont know why ... maybe the look ... ? but when i look at the vaio specs ... its hard to choose the mac 
22:04  b3ny0-: I've been a windows user for 16 years, got my first mac a few months ago
22:04  flimmern: you forgot to calculate osx in there
22:04  flimmern: and iLife etc.
22:04  flimmern: that's a bunch of great software. the vaio is a nice machine, but you're stuck with windows and a metric fuckton of other pre-installed crapware
22:04  Tu13es: yoluca: the "look" is really very little a factor
22:04  b3ny0-: ilife might be decent
22:04  b3ny0-: but I almost never use it
22:04  Tu13es: the OS is pretty substantially different, in a good way
22:04  b3ny0-: so I would rather have it excluded for a lower price
22:05  b3ny0-: I wish there was an OSX core version
22:05  yoluca: but hold on ... can you not just but the vaio and buy the os x too ? 
22:05  b3ny0-: if you want the best hardware for the money, mac is probably not the answer
22:06  b3ny0-: but apple makes the most solid laptops overall imho
22:06  yoluca: hmm
22:06  Tsavo: here here
22:06  b3ny0-: I would almost buy it solely for the trackpad
22:07  b3ny0-: which rapes and kills everything that pc-trackpads has to give
22:07  Tsavo: I like the new trackpad but i wish it still had an independent button
22:07  b3ny0-: the multitouch just makes it so much faster to navigate its ridiculous
22:07  b3ny0-: yeah
22:07  b3ny0-: that's one gripe though
22:07  yoluca: if i never used a mac before .,.. wonder if is worth spending so much ...just because the os... that i will prob ... dont even use 
22:08  yoluca: hmmm its hard ... dammmmmm
22:08  Tu13es: yoluca: if you don't plan on using OS X, don't bother buying a Mac, imho
22:08  b3ny0-: I rarely ever turn my windows desktop on anymore
22:08  b3ny0-: no that's pointless
22:09  flimmern: Tsavo: i like the mac trackpad especially for not having that button :)
22:09  yoluca: i need my vmware on the machine ... i will do remote ...and play games ... and yeah surf :)) 
22:09  Tsavo: I'm used to it with a button and when I use a new MB my thumb always presses really hard on the area between the trackpad and the little lip that you open the laptop with
22:09  Tsavo: i'm used to the button being right there
22:10  Tsavo: I just need to readjust I suppose. For now i'll keep my laptop closed and use a mouse ;)
22:10  flimmern: i never press anything at all, just tap with my finger
22:11  flimmern: btw i used to hate touchpads until i got my mac
22:11  Tsavo: yah, all small and off center. What are those PC manufacturers thinking?
22:11  flimmern: it's just not comparable to what everyone else uses
22:12  flimmern: Tsavo: not only that, but it feels like they're not responding at all
22:12  Tsavo: Mine sort of feels like that now that I've used it for so long and worn it down so much
22:13  Tsavo: but i remember the good ol' days when i barely had to touch it...
22:13  Tsavo: any opinions on the new apple mouses?
22:14  Tsavo: are the touch gestures good?
22:14  Tu13es: the magic mouse is an ergonomic nightmare
22:14  Tsavo: I noticed that from the pictures. Looks like Apple is going for portiblility/aerodynamic design rather than ergonomic
22:14  b3ny0-: flimmern: me too, but pressing and holding down on the trackpad to move stuff can be a bit of an arse
22:15  b3ny0-: that's the only flaw though
22:16  Tsavo: I'm using a Microsoft mouse from who knows when and it's good enough for me
22:16  b3ny0-: me too
22:16  b3ny0-: or a razer deathadder to be exact
22:16  flimmern: b3ny0-: it just double tap and it holds
22:16  flimmern: -t
22:17  b3ny0-: I thought that launched it?
22:17  Tsavo: I remember when I first started those gestures on my Macbook. I could do everything mouse related with zero noise. no more noisy clicking
22:17  b3ny0-: oh you mean just taps
22:18  Brisk: The Magic Mouse is actually somewhat neat. The gestures/touch are nice. However, I also game in Boot Camp, so use a fancier mouse.
22:18  b3ny0-: doesn't work here
22:18  b3ny0-: yeah the click is quite solid and loud
22:19  flimmern: b3ny0-: double tap and leave your finger on the pad :)
22:19  Tsavo: make sure you have drag lock enabled http://midspin.webhop.net/2.jpg
22:19  b3ny0-: that sounds more time consuming than clicking and holding, but perhaps more comfy
22:19  flimmern: one gets used to it :)
22:20  Tsavo: buhbye
22:35  webPragmatist: anyone using office 11 yet?
22:51  WaY: hello
22:52  WaY: anybody with a new MacBook Air with 2.13 processor?
22:58  crilly: not i
22:58  crilly: night
22:58  almonds: me
22:59  almonds: not new
22:59  almonds: but i got a air 2.13 in my lap rite now, its a clients
22:59  almonds: working on it
22:59  almonds: 2gb ram, 128gig ssd
22:59  almonds: runs fine
22:59  almonds: just installed parallels on it with windows
23:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
23:16 --- CPng|N1 is now known as CPng|N
23:24 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
23:27  blez: hey
23:28  blez: I'm new to mac, I opened a vmware image of macos x
23:28  blez: on every install it wants a User and Password
23:28  blez: is there any way to see all users and their passwords ?
23:29  almonds: confused
23:29  almonds: explain what you are doing again?
23:30  blez: er.
23:30  blez: is there a way to see all users and their passwords
23:31  blez: let's say I'm on another computer
23:34  blez: how to get current user's password?
23:41  al_admeld: blez: you know thats asking for the admin password right
23:41  al_admeld: the one youre logged in as
23:54  jeffmr: do cuda drivers work with mbpro late 2008 9600m gt cards and do they provide any better performance for games?
23:54  CPng|N: the whole idea of a password is that others do not know it. If you could list the passwords out, you'd have a massive security issue
23:58  DistortedLoop: any opinions on "best" IRC client for Mac?  Using Colloquy but it really pinwheels/beachballs too often and seems to drag the whole system down.
