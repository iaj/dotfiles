13:59  syn7ax: are there any vodafone mobile broadband / mobile connect software working with osx 10.3.2?
14:01  syn7ax: K3520 HUAWEI
14:01  Angostura: bless you
14:04  thnee: haha
14:05  syn7ax: ^^ no chance?
14:12  thnee: syn7ax: why dont you ask vodafone?
14:17  syn7ax: they suck hard as hell
14:18  syn7ax: but i found a solution. i need VMC Software v2.1 
14:19  LSD`: Any particular reason you're running 10.3.2 and haven't upgraded it to at lrast 10.3.9?
14:21  syn7ax: got some crashes when i try to upgrade to 10.3.9 dunno why but had ro re-setup the hole system 2 or 3 times. and now im scared and im glad that the system is running
14:22  syn7ax: made a ram check and got some errors here. think ram is damaged
14:23  syn7ax: i hit the book hard one yeahr ago.. maybe that was not good^^
14:24  syn7ax: but now im searching for an VMC 2.1 downlaod
14:24  syn7ax: cant find it here: http://www.business.vodafone.com/site/bus/public/enuk/support/10_productsupport/laptop_connectivity/40_software/software/20_previous/p_mac.jsp
14:26  thnee: syn7ax: if i were you, id search for a new job instead. so i could afford a new computer
14:28  syn7ax: yeah man. you right.. :(
14:28 * syn7ax is currently job searching 
14:29  syn7ax: coding for food^^
14:30  syn7ax: anyone got a job for me?
14:37  syn7ax: :D
15:07  syn7ax: tschöööhööö
15:09  syn7ax: eins müsst ich noch wissen. ich such ne moeglichkeit unter osx 10.3.2 eine festplatte zu partitionieren. welches tool empfiehlt sich da?
15:20  LaraX: !seen remyo
15:20 @Securabot: LaraX, remyo (~remyo@adsl-36-99-19.asm.bellsouth.net) was last seen quitting ##mac 7 hours 15 minutes ago (07.10. 06:05) stating "Quit: remyo" after spending 5 minutes there.
15:27 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
15:28  syn7ax: which osx can i run on a ibook g4? latest pls
15:28  Angostura: 10.5 Leopard
15:28  LaraX: Leopard
15:29  Angostura: Though 10.4 might be a better bet, less resource hungry
15:29  shadewind: if I get a Mac Pro with 3 GB RAM, I'll have to replace all of the modules to get 6 GB of RAM and still retain the triple channel bandwidth?
15:30  jer_: shadewind, yup
15:30  shadewind: and that's what you're supposed to do?
15:31  shadewind: well... even though people recommend to never buy memory through Apple, 6GB memory upgrade when ordering would be cheaper than buying 6GB aftermarket
15:32  LaraX: why not get it from Apple?
15:33  shadewind: because they overcharge a bit compared to the actual cost for the components
15:33  LaraX: is what they use better though?
15:33  syn7ax: Angostura: if it is less resource hungry i prefer the 10.4 too
15:33  shadewind: nah... it's the same
15:33  syn7ax: thx
15:33  shadewind: LaraX: same stuff, they just chrage more for it
15:34  shadewind: there is not a 2200 SEK price difference between 3GB and 6GB
15:34  LaraX: syn7ax: Leopard was ok on my PowerBook G4 17", but it might be different on iBooks
15:35  syn7ax: hmm yeah, might be.
15:35  LaraX: shadewind: ok, I got more RAM from here once: http://www.tekserve.com/ , don't know what  kind they used
15:36  shadewind: LaraX: I'm from Sweden so I don't think it helps me much, but thanks .)
15:36  shadewind: :)
15:36  syn7ax: which tool should i use to create a second partition under osx10.3.2?
15:37  ZaiS: diskutility
15:37  shadewind: the final question, though, is whether to get an 8-core or a quad-core
15:37 --- mikeplus32 is now known as mikeplus64
15:37  syn7ax: does it comes with 10.3?
15:37  LaraX: shadewind: I see :) are you going to replace the RAM yourself?
15:38  shadewind: LaraX: yeah, I've built about several PCs and replaced numerous components myself so I feel pretty confident
15:38  antii: shadewind: D:
15:39  shadewind: antii: ;)
15:39  syn7ax: ZaiS: does it comes with 10.3?
15:39  ZaiS: i think yes
15:41  ZaiS: Disk utility is part of Mac OS X (should be in every OS X)
15:41  syn7ax: ah yes, i used it 2 weeks ago.. but cant find any option to create new partitions in it
15:42  syn7ax: create hd images yes .. but no partitions
15:42  syn7ax: im wrong sry..
15:42  ZaiS: go to partions tab
15:42  syn7ax: yes i found it. thx m8
15:42  shadewind: anyone believe I'm right in thinking that higher clock frequency (3.2 over 2.4) will probably give similar performance boosts as more cores (8 over 4)
15:43  shadewind: ?
15:43  syn7ax: shadewind: i do, yes
15:43  jer_: shadewind, depends on the workload
15:43  ZaiS: performance depence on application as well as on hardware
15:43  shadewind: jer_: obviously
15:43  shadewind: in this case, it's DAWs
15:44  shadewind: Cubase 5 more specifically
15:44  jer_: shadewind, if it's that obvious, then why did you ask the question the way you did without providing some workload details you'll be subjecting it to?
15:44  shadewind: jer_: I'm not very good at making choices
15:44  shadewind: it's a problem I have
15:44  shadewind: an irrational one at that
15:45  syn7ax: 4cores are ok.. so bedder more frequency
15:46  shadewind: from what I understand, the single CPU Mac Pro systems use 3500-series Xeon CPUs while the dual CPU systems use 5500-series Xeon CPUs
15:46  shadewind: if I understand correctly, the only difference is that the 5500 series support dual CPU configurations?
15:49  syn7ax: ZaiS: i cant create a new partion under the boot partition with disk utility. :
15:49  syn7ax: damn
15:49  ZaiS: any error massages?
15:50  syn7ax: no, there is only the information that i cant do it with the start-volume. the buttons r gray
15:51  ZaiS: have no idea then
15:51  syn7ax: damn
15:51  syn7ax: mabye another tool can do it?
15:52  ZaiS: as i see problem in old OS version (for other tools)
15:52  syn7ax: tru
15:52  syn7ax: or can i boot disk utility from the installation disk?
15:52  syn7ax: perhaps it works if the system is not running
15:53  syn7ax: like a live linux cd
15:53  ZaiS: yes you should be able to run disk utility from boot cd
15:53  ZaiS: disk utility is part of install cd
15:53  syn7ax: hmm so i will try this later..
15:53  ZaiS: not sure is it try for OS X < 10.4
15:54  syn7ax: k
15:54  ZaiS: true i mean
15:55 * syn7ax afk
15:56  LaraX: spline: hi?
15:56  LaraX: just saw that...
15:57  spline: hi
15:58  spline: you said something yesterday with my name in it
15:58  spline: didn't see anything else in my lgos
15:58  LaraX: yeah I was going to show you something, let me see if I still have it
15:59  LaraX: spline: can you believe this? http://www.speedtest.net/result/979640581.png
16:03  spline: whoa
16:03  spline: that's horrid
16:03  spline: LaraX: on Sprint's software, I recall a way for you to measure the RSSI or some of the other signal strengths
16:04  spline: I had it on my palm treo and could monitor it
16:04  spline: if you're not downloading and its over 500ms, I'd disconnect
16:04  thelostpatrol: LaraX, those were awesome speeds in 1992
16:11  LaraX: spline: for the last few months at random times it keep switching from EVDO Rev A to IXRTT, I did this speed test in Chrome while loading Firefox with all its tabs... it was EVDO Rev A when I started, then it switched to IXRTT again
16:12  LaraX: thelostpatrol: I know, it's worse than dial up sometimes
16:12  LaraX: keeps*
16:12  LaraX: spline: but I'm waiting for 4G to be announced in NYC so I can get a new card, I've heard it's available but not anounced yet
16:13  LaraX: announced*
16:13  LaraX: it's been driving me crazy, sometimes I spend hours just trying to get 1 page to load like Gmail and have to keep restarting
16:20  spline: LaraX: it could mean that the tower you're getting evdo rev A is not close enough
16:20  spline: I again suggest you look into some type of antenna for your phone if possible
16:20  spline: or get one of their cards
16:20  spline: getting an antenna is like light and day
16:21  spline: yeah that's exactly why I wound up buying a nice Wifi USB setup and later just paying for internet
16:21  spline: so many people over the years assume they can go full-time on wireless even if they dont download a lot
16:21  spline: and its still got a long way to go
16:23  LaraX: spline: but the same card is being used in the same location as before and it used to be fine, so I think it's from their tower. and if my antenna you mean that external thing they give where there's a cord and you can have the card vertical (I've heard it supposedly helps), I'm using that now and it hasn't really made a difference
16:24  LaraX: if by*
16:24  LaraX: spline: and it's not a phone, it's a mobile broadband card
16:24  londonmet050: hello
16:24  LaraX: hi
16:24  spline: well is it some cheap antenna or an external one?
16:24  londonmet050: Is there a way to stop the MBP at boot up
16:24  spline: getting it near a window or higher up helps
16:24  londonmet050: like a BIOS password
16:25  londonmet050: Something that stops MBP from booting
16:26  LaraX: spline: it's something that came with it, it plugs into the usb, then there's a wire and you attach the card to the top of the laptop vertically. I thought it was just for if you don't have space next to the laptop, but maybe it's an antenna too, or used for better reception
16:29  LaraX: spline: it might be what it says here: http://www6.sprint.com/landings/speedtest/?ECID=vanity:speedtest "If your device supports an extendable or shark fin antenna, place it in the upright position. Often, putting your antenna in an upright position will result in a receiver sensitivity gain of around 2 to 3 dB." though I don't know what an "extendable or shark fin antenna" is/looks like or if that's what mine is
16:29  LaraX: sorry I forgot to include that's # 10. ^
16:30  spline: shark antenna looks like a shark fin
16:30  spline: if it were above the water
16:30  LaraX: ok then it's not that, this is just a wire
16:30  spline: oh ouch 
16:31  spline: thats not effective  then
16:31  spline: antenna design is critical as to the design if its for someone in a car or where you're stationary in a location
16:31  spline: usually they give you an omni that looks like a normal antenna (on a car) where it has a base and sticks up
16:32  spline: but you can get directional that have to be positioned, which you can easily see
16:33  londonmet050: spline: Is there a way to autenticate MBP before pre boot
16:33  spline: google it
16:35  LaraX: spline: yeah it's not that, here http://shop.sprint.com/NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/DisplayPhones?phoneSKU=SWU598DORA it says "Included Accessories: Monitor clip with USB extension cable"
16:36  LaraX: spline: I was searching Sprint's forums and it seems others are having this problem too and it's from their towers. I shouldn't have to get an antenna when it used to be ok, they need to fix it...
16:36  spline: yeah I looked at those
16:36  spline: I recall they have a very tiny port that becomes a RP-SMA (common antenna connector)
16:37  spline: well no clue where you are in the area but I can't recall anywhere in the 5 b's that had bad reception
16:37  spline: even going over the verazono, throgs, whitestone
16:37  spline: triboro they have towers all over
16:37  LaraX: yeah, it's only been like this the last few months, and I'm in Manhattan, it shouldn't be like this...
16:38  LaraX: it's from them, they just take forever to do anything and don't have very good customer service I guess
16:39  spline: well sprint does listen since dan hesse took over
16:39  spline: or more than they did before
16:39  LaraX: once they suggested I close my account so they wouldn't/couldn't do anything about these problems
16:39  spline: they're #3 in the US so they have to be sens. I never had major issues with them like ATT
16:39  LaraX: because they*
16:39  spline: well that's the last case option when you have bad reception 
16:39  spline: its not a bad thing since you dont get an early term fee
16:40  spline: because wireless isn't an exact thing and they can't just build a tower for everyone
16:40  LaraX: yeah, they offered to give a new card instead, it didn't really help, then they offered to give mifi, I didn't want that... I just wanted this card to work. it's one of their products too
16:40  LaraX: I hope the 4G card will be better
16:40  spline: here: http://3gstore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1618&cPath=290&m1track=googlebase#googlebase
16:41  spline: if you already called on it, they might sell you a discount antenna setup
16:41  spline: not sure if they'd do it but always worth a try
16:41  spline: when I had sprint and neared my two year extension, I called to get the "fav five" that tmobile did then they copied
16:41  spline: and the person on the phone added it to my contract w/o a reup
16:43  LaraX: is the antenna big?
16:43  LaraX: (I'm asking because that page is taking forever to load btw)
16:43  spline: a normal one is usually about 1.5" in diameter base
16:44  spline: and the antenna is.. maybe 5" high?
16:44  spline: that alone can help big time
16:44  spline: ofcourse you can get crazy on antennas but anything larger usually requires an amp thats gonna  run you a few hundred alone 
16:44 --- luist_ is now known as luist
16:44  spline: http://3gstore.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=138_240
16:45  spline: here http://3gstore.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=138_240&products_id=1223
16:45  LaraX: that's ridiculous that you'd need an antenna in Manhattan, I'm not in the middle of nowhere
16:45  LaraX: in a location it used to be fine
16:45  spline: heh at least you're not on ATT
16:45  vxla: what provider do you have LaraX ?
16:45  spline: two folks I knew with iphones cancelled because of how bad service was
16:46  LaraX: maybe if you're driving around with it or going to remote locations then maybe
16:46  vxla: I work in an ATT facility and my service sucks :)
16:46  LaraX: vxla: Sprint. did you see the speedtest?
16:46  spline: yeah sprint was always perfect in NYC
16:46  vxla: LaraX: nope.
16:46  LaraX: vxla: this is worst it's been. ridiculous http://www.speedtest.net/result/979640581.png
16:46  vxla: Sprint is pretty good here in Chicago too, but no one really uses it here that I know (except those former nextel people)
16:46  spline: the only complaint I ever had with them was listening to streaming radio on my way down to there, they lack coverage in the rural areas on the Cross near New Haven
16:47  spline: LaraX: you also have zero access to getting a wifi connection?
16:47  LaraX: vxla: I've had Sprint since the end of 1998 and haven't wanted to switch. I want an iPhone but not AT&T
16:47  vxla: Whatever network the iphone goes to next is going to have as many problems as we did.
16:48  LaraX: spline: yeah, it's making me enter and password and stuff
16:48  LaraX: vxla: do you have an iPhone?
16:48  vxla: providers just don't have the capacity between the tower and their core networks
16:48  vxla: LaraX: yes I do.
16:48  LaraX: if Sprint got the iPhone I'd get it for sure, regardless of whatever problems...
16:48  spline: yeah
16:48  LaraX: it can't be worse than this, it can only get better
16:48  vxla: It'll take VZW a few years to catch up
16:48  spline: heh sprint would love it im sure but would also reek havok
16:49  vxla: if VZW was smart they'd be upgrading now, but in a recession it's doubtful that's happening.
16:50  vxla: I also wonder if providers are looking at ipv6 handhelds and some sort of a CGN yet or not.
16:50  londonmet050: I got the open firmware passowrd
16:50  londonmet050: but clicking on the setup just crashes
16:50  vxla: LaraX: the worst part about that speedtest is the laency -- that's awful
16:50  LaraX: spline: the images in your link aren't loading, and I refreshed the page
16:52  LaraX: vxla: yeah, I took that test in Chrome while loading Firefox with all its tabs, it used to be EVDO Rev A all the time, the last few months it keeps switching to IXRTT
16:52  LaraX: 1XRTT*
16:53  LaraX: lol, I'm taking another speed test right now and think it froze... unless I'm about to disconnect too
16:54 * LaraX pings herself
16:54  spline: larax: you might want to get something that doesn't load the images via prefs/extensions
16:54  spline: I had to do that a few times
16:55  LaraX: is this bad? [07] 10:54:32 AM * Ping reply from LaraX: 40.40 second(s)
16:55  vxla:  CTCP PING reply from vxla: 3.514 second
16:55  vxla: and I'm over a v6 tunnel
16:56  vxla: so yes, that's bad
16:56  LaraX: I think that's a yes :)
16:56  LaraX: not as bad as 9,000+ whatever it was!
16:56  vxla: 40 seconds is worse than 9000ms
16:56  LaraX: almost 10,000
16:57  vxla: but you're talking about ICMP tests vs. TCP rtt's
16:57  vxla: so not a fair comparison
17:02  LaraX: ok this is from right now, it finally finished: http://www.speedtest.net/result/981542369.png a little better?
17:02  vxla: a bit
17:02  vxla: what is your ping time to the following address...
17:03  vxla: 144.232.7.136
17:03  spline: yeah 
17:04  LaraX: I do this in Terminal right?
17:04  vxla: yes
17:04  vxla: ping -c 10 144.232.7.136
17:05  spline: did you get your mac back?
17:05  LaraX: oh yeah, vxla I'm on Vista right now and that didn't work
17:06  vxla: ah sorry
17:06  LaraX: spline: there is no getting it back, yeah I have it but it still doesn't work and I don't want it
17:06  vxla: ping -t 144.232.7.136
17:06  vxla: then let it run for a few seconds
17:06  LaraX: vxla: it's ok, I should've specified :) thanks
17:07  spline: ah heh
17:07  spline: you should sell
17:07  mitnavn: Anyone know how to make the "Bypass proxy"-setting actually work for the specified domains? Nothing is happening right now, it's still going through my proxy.
17:10  vxla: methinks it's time for starbucks
17:12  LaraX: vxla: I was afk, how much of this do you want to see? you can tell me when you come back
17:13  LaraX: spline: yeah like anyone would buy that
17:13  LaraX: or they would for very little
17:14 * danl pokes lara and runs away
17:14 * LaraX catches danl and gives him a hug so he can't run
17:14  danl: :D
17:14  LaraX: :)
