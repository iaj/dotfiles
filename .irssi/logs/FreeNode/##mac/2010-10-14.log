00:00  ahihi: there's no central mixer that controls all of them
00:00  barathron: I see
00:01  Branes: WaveRT is a piece of utter shit.
00:01  Angostura: Yup, each app defines it's own volume within the parameters set out by the System Volume
00:01 --- londonmet050_ is now known as londonmet050
00:01  Branes: Not only does it add an obscene amount of latency into internal audio signals, it flatly refuses to work with external audio interfaces.
00:05  ahihi: I know little about the implementation, it's the concept I'm interested in :)
00:06  ahihi: the fact that there's no general way to, say, mute a specific application is a bit silly in this day and age
00:09  bassliner: ahihi: i totally agree with that and even windows 7 was limping years behind after other operating systems had ways to define the volume for each app seperately without having to actually switch to each app.
00:09  bassliner: ahihi: but that's by far a smaller problem than applications like vlc with a volume slider going higher than 100%.
00:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
00:10  ahihi: well, it's useful at times
00:12  bassliner: you can't disable it. that's all.
00:12  bassliner: and the volume slider is the most wrong place to implement such a thing into a gui i can think of.
00:12  KeeperOfTheSoul: how so? it makes sense in a media player application
00:12  bassliner: absolutely not.
00:13  KeeperOfTheSoul: well what else would you have?
00:13  bassliner: if you want a volume booster (which will in any case distort if you stretch things to more than the maximal value which you have exactly no indicator for except your ears) then go for it, but don't confuse it with a volume slider.
00:14  bassliner: it's a false attempt by all means.
00:14  Angostura: bassliner: You could implement in the Print dialogue, if you want a 'wronger' place
00:14  KeeperOfTheSoul: oh right, I thought you just ment volume sliders in apps were a bad idea
00:14  Angostura: me too
00:14  KeeperOfTheSoul: yeah, it is annoying in VLC that you try to set the volume to 100% and end up boosting it
00:14  bassliner: Angostura: hm. at least that would be more hidden from the actual user interface and not on the volume slider, which by all means should go up to 100% and NOTHING else.
00:15  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: exactly.
00:15  KeeperOfTheSoul: especially since VLC seems to go to about 1000%, leaving a very small area for 0-100
00:15  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: oh no. volume sliders are a great idea because you can limit the amplitude multiplicator, which is completely right and okay.
00:15  KeeperOfTheSoul: I'd say you want something non-linear, a nice big area for 0-100
00:16  KeeperOfTheSoul: then a similar sized area for 100-1000, only that area starts hidden, and maybe click a button to enable boost, which unlocks the extra range of the slider
00:16  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: i'd say you should be able to define if you want it linear or s-shaped or xÂ² shaped.
00:16  KeeperOfTheSoul: could even do a fancy animation where a cover slides up to reveal the extra area :)
00:17  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: if you want it i'd be like hey cool KeeperOfTheSoul has a way to live different from mine, so let him live that way.
00:17  KeeperOfTheSoul: bassliner: most people wouldn't understand that though, and you don't want to overwhelm a user with too many choices
00:17  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: and that's exactly why a volume slider that will give you the ability to distort audio is the wrong attempt.
00:17  KeeperOfTheSoul: so first you need to decide if your aiming for a standard user, or someone who wants to tweak everything (and knows what it means)
00:18  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: the problem is that with such attempts, you force the limitations of standard users on power users.
00:18  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: which then in turn can't make things suit to their needs.
00:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: bassliner: not really, one app doesn't really do well if it tries to be both standard and power, needs to pick one or the other
00:19  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: then goddamn make an option in the preferences for "set maximum volume slider level: [......]"
00:20  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: and if you want to help idiots to not shoot in their own feet maybe hide it by putting it into "advanced preferences (warning warning bla bla this is for advanced power users that know what they're doing bla bla, you have been warned bla)" or something.
00:20  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: i strongly disagree with that.
00:21  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: if you make applications that idiots can use, only idiots will use it.
00:22  Branes: That sums up Apple rather well :)
00:22  bassliner: Branes: absolutely.
00:23  bassliner: but that volume slider thing is like "hey, a light bulb works with 230V, here you have a slider that will let you put 600V into it, so you can make the light brighter. oh we didn't mention you can destroy the bulb and we don't put any limitation at around 230 whatsoever so be careful."
00:24  bassliner: don't even get me started on itunes' gapless playback and cover art foo...
00:26  Angostura: bassliner: Explain the gapless playback issue?
00:28  Angostura: Gapless playback is surely something you can control on an album/track level using Get Info
00:36  bassliner: Angostura: well, i don't want to? it doesn't get me rid of the problem itunes determining some stuff when i drag'n'drop stuff to it.
00:37  bassliner: Angostura: cog-x is a good solution to that problem, it plays music. not more, not less. unfortunately the playlist management capabilities are just missing. songbird is good in my views, but it lacks features too, and it eats up cpu for nothing. mpg123 fits my needs very well but it has no playlist capabilities.
00:38  Angostura: bassliner: hang on, presumably iTunes has a reasonable assessment of what should be gapless. Examples of where it gets it wrtong?
00:39  bassliner: Angostura: i didn't say it gets it wrong. i want to disable the detection.
00:40  Angostura: Uh... OK
00:40  ahihi: I like Vox
00:40  bassliner: Angostura: it will render itunes user interface unusable for hours when i just drag a few gigabytes onto it (which happens daily if you are a musician and label-holder).
00:40  ahihi: it's got a nice minimal UI and plays FLAC
00:41 --- londonmet050_ is now known as londonmet050
00:41  Angostura: You drag a few gigs of files onto iTunes daily? Yup I can say that you are not the target user
00:42  bassliner: Angostura: that problem especially gets much worse with mix sets that last 1 or more hours and with stuff that is on remote shares like samba/nfs/afs shares, oh, i didn't even mention sshfs stuff.
00:42  Angostura: Definitely not the target user
00:42  ahihi: iTunes also does weird things to the audio signal even when you turn all "enhancements" off
00:43  bassliner: Angostura: ok, so i'm the fault when itunes is too stupid to maintain a few gigabytes of songs?
00:43  ahihi: I don't know what exactly but it sounds different from everything else
00:43  bassliner: ahihi: interesting...
00:43  Angostura: No, you're not at fault
00:43  Angostura: You just don't have a typical use-case
00:44  bassliner: Angostura: foobar2000 under windows has no problems whatsoever when i drag'n'drop a f*ckin terabyte of music into it, not to mention i can entirely use the complete user interface while it processes those songs...
00:45  b3ny0-: foobar <3
00:45  b3ny0-: rapes itunes with no vaseline
00:45  Angostura: bassliner: iTunes exists to cater for users syncing their iPods and buying from the Store. Shrug
00:46  bassliner: Angostura: oh i thought i could listen to music with it. excuse me for that wish. oh, and excuse me for having so much music. i will delete it so the software doesn't get problems with my way to live.
00:46  bassliner: *shrug*
00:46  Angostura: bassliner: I'm not getting at you and I'm not excusing iTunes
00:47  b3ny0-: well, they wanted an "all-in-one" solution
00:47  bassliner: Angostura: i'm just trying to make my point of view clear. no offense. :)
00:47  Angostura: But it is like me getting annoyed because Pages is not Quark Xpress
00:47  bassliner: Angostura: lol
00:48  b3ny0-: can't someone port foobar to osx please
00:48  bassliner: oh snap, i reckon they will do something like "why do we have a mail application and a browser? and oh wait why do we even have a seperate app for chatting?" in osx 10.7
00:48  bassliner: ph34r
00:48  b3ny0-: why have a separate app for anything?
00:48  b3ny0-: just throw it all into one
00:48  b3ny0-: :P
00:48  bassliner: yo dawg :)
00:49  bassliner: i herd yo like apps, so we put an app in yer app :)
00:50  ahihi: my ideal audio player would be a daemon that plays a queue of files gaplessly
00:51  ahihi: plus a command line interface for editing the queue and controlling playback
00:51  ahihi: I will probably have to write it myself
00:51  bassliner: ahihi: mpd will come close.
00:51  Angostura: ahihi: You can do that in Finder, can't you
00:51  bassliner: Angostura: no.
00:51  bassliner: ahihi: it even supports very different ways of user interfaces.
00:51  ahihi: mpd seems a little bit overkill
00:51  bassliner: why that?
00:52  bassliner: ahihi: maybe hacking mpg123 would be a good solution then
00:52  bassliner: damn this apple/peach spritzer is the shit.
00:53  ahihi: well, it comes with all sorts of cruft I don't need
00:53  ahihi: mpg123 only plays mp3, doesn't it?
00:53  bassliner: ahihi: then try to hack some software mixing around mpg123.
00:53  bassliner: exactly.
00:53  ahihi: I need FLAC :)
00:53  bassliner: hehe
00:54  Angostura: bassliner:  Select all files in a folder, hit QuickLook, hit Play
00:54  bassliner: Angostura: that would even involve a desktop machine being up just to play music.
00:54  ahihi: and watch playback stop when you switch to another program
00:54  bassliner: Angostura: also you wouldn't be able to use those files while you listen.
00:55  bassliner: ahihi: exactly.
00:55  ahihi: (and no FLAC support)
00:55  bassliner: ahihi: exactly.
00:55  Tomis: itunes
00:55  Tomis: problem solved
00:55  ahihi: which problem?
00:55  ahihi: not mine
00:55  Tomis: here's my music. i don't want ot know or care how it's stored
00:55  Tomis: computer, take care of it
00:55  bassliner: Tomis: please read at least some parts of the discussion if you want to take part in it.
00:55  Angostura: Tomis: It won't copy a terabyte of files over wet string without complaining
00:56  Tomis: why wouldn't you have at least a 4tb internal drive anyway
00:56  Tomis: oh for the day apple offers dual HDs on the laptops... mmmm
00:56  bassliner: Tomis: that's a reasonable attempt at organizing music and i think it's cool it exists. but it is not cool that this way of organizing music is being forced on someone.
00:56  ahihi: I used to use iTunes when I had a measly 7000-file library
00:56  ahihi: and it got slow
00:57  bassliner: Tomis: and i have a 4tb file server in the kitchen that does just that.
00:57  ahihi: I shudder to think how poorly it would perform now
00:57  bassliner: Tomis: seriously, you don't want to try to dragndrop those 4tb onto itunes.
00:57  Tomis: well they've improved the performance
00:57  b3ny0-: anyone know of a software to download an embedded video
00:57  Tomis: why not bassliner 
00:57  bassliner: because it breaks?
00:57  Tomis: just turn off "copy to library"
00:57  bassliner: i have that off.
00:57  Tomis: problem solved
00:58  ahihi: it'll still want to check gapless info
00:58  bassliner: b/s.
00:58  Tomis: what do you use for your media player
00:58  bassliner: foobar2000.
00:58  Tomis: it's got playlists, smart playlists, and all that goodness?
00:58  bassliner: yap
00:58  Tomis: awesome
00:59  bassliner: tho it's not for macos.
00:59  Tomis: isn't it?
00:59  Tomis: i thought there was a port
00:59  ahihi: I really have no need for playlists or even a "library"
00:59  ahihi: my file system suffices
00:59  Tomis: gross
00:59  Angostura: And your big CD-changer :-)
01:00  bassliner: but it's rock stable, i had no complaints in YEARS on it, it's very configurable, very modular and minimalistic, has an extremely lightweight resources footprint and it doesn't stop working just because i dragndrop a shitload of files onto it
01:00  Tomis: sometimes i want to listen to an album straight through
01:00  Tomis: but mostly i want to listen to a mix
01:00  ahihi: I always listen to entire albums
01:00  Tomis: i use the ratings in itunes to mark songs by their feel
01:00  Tomis: lower stars for slower stuff, higher stars for more upbeat/faster stuff
01:00  Angostura: I can't remember the last time I didn;t listen to a mix
01:01  Tomis: then i have a couple smart playlists to sort through all that
01:01  Tomis: usually i don't want to listen to something specific, i just want a mood, so i've got playlists to set the mood i want
01:02  Tomis: wish they'd integrate something like Moody, i used it for a while, but i gave up and went to using stars and smart playlists to essentially accomplish the same thing
01:04  ahihi: most of my music is concept albums
01:04  ahihi: breaking them up would be an insult to the artists
01:04  ahihi: ;)
01:04  Tomis: bleh
01:04  Tomis: i did that with some of my pink floyd yea
01:21  bassliner: that gapless stuff is just completely retarded. that's exactly what a cuesheet and a single file rip is for.
01:24  ahihi: why is that better?
01:24  Angostura: Nope, it's exactly what my wife wants if she has a couple of  Pink Floyd Albums
01:24  ahihi: it's often nice to be able to treat tracks as separate files
01:25  ahihi: I do wonder why iTunes needs to perform some kind of lengthy analysis to figure out gapless playback though
01:26  ahihi: (does anyone else listen to gapless albums that aren't pink floyd?)
01:26  Branes: Constantly.
01:26  ahihi: well I already know you have good taste in music ;)
01:27  Branes: Got any Dave Greenslade?
01:27  bassliner: Angostura: because you won't have to analyze your entire music collection for much less than 1% of gapless album being ripped as multiple files by accident?
01:27  bassliner: err
01:28  bassliner: ahihi: 
01:28  Angostura: bassliner: I've never had gapless analysis take more than about 10 seconds
01:28  ahihi: bassliner: I don't use iTunes, so I don't have to :)
01:28 * Branes is currently re-enjoying "Pentateuch Of The Cosmogony" by Dave Greenslade & Patrick Woodroffe
01:28  bassliner: you can still work with a single file as if it were multiple ones inside your playing applications
01:28  bassliner: (with a .cue file)
01:29  bassliner: Angostura: it completely hangs my itunes and renders it unusable
01:29  bassliner: Angostura: especially with network shares
01:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: or a different file format that supports multiple tracks in a single file
01:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: ie, audio stream and cue combined
01:29  bassliner: yup
01:29  Angostura: Asw, I say
01:30  KeeperOfTheSoul: which iTunes alread supports, since they do that with podcasts and audiobooks to get chapters
01:30  bassliner: KeeperOfTheSoul: exactly
01:30  ahihi: that would be suboptimal for things like importing to Traktor
01:30  ahihi: or any DJ software for that matter
01:31  bassliner:  ahihi you don't want to import gapless tunes at all in dj'ing apps.
01:31  ahihi: sure I do
01:32  bassliner: and if so, you'll be able to do so with a 1hr file too instead of having to analyze your whole music collection just to find out what's gapless (and without being able to disable that in itunes)
01:32  ahihi: the analysis issue only holds true for iTunes
01:32  ahihi: which I still don't use
01:33  ahihi: Vox does gapless playback just fine without any of that
01:37  bassliner: whatever, goodnight ppl.
01:37  ahihi: oh, I guess only lossy compression introduces a problem
01:38  ahihi: well that makes sense
01:58  GarryFre: Google is being my retarded enemy today. I search for any solution to increasing the volume of the all in one mac. I plug in external amplified speakers and it just doesn't cut it. I could have my head slammed into the mac and I still can barely hear it.
02:04  S_SubZero: the iMac, you mean?
02:04  Cressalys: So i dun like the camera on my new itouch
02:04  Cressalys: -_-
02:07  GarryFre: yes, imac
02:10  S_SubZero: Is OS X reporting the volume is turned to max?
02:11  Angostura: An SMC reset might be worth a try
02:11  Tomis: turn up the volume on the externals too?
02:11  Angostura: or is it PRAM?
02:11  Angostura: get your ears syringed? 
02:14  GarryFre: Everything is reported as turned to the max
02:17  maguey_: I have 2 copies of skype running at he same time with different accounts , and it works just fine. My problem is that since each copy is rruning in 2 different accounts and I am not able to share perform some copy/paste among these apps. I set the env var DISPLAY equal in both terminal, but still does not work

04:03  manda_moore: not me... i'm not very good at distinguishing fonts :P

04:14  LaraX: osxdude: so it's like one of these on the top/bottom right? http://www.atpm.com/8.09/images/pcp-font-smoothing.gif
04:14  FriedBob: LaraX: So turn the heat up? :)
04:15  LaraX: FriedBob: if heat makes it work, why doesn't it work in the Summer either?!
04:16  FriedBob: LaraX: Too much heat in summer?
04:16  LaraX: ok, then what about the Spring/Fall?
04:17  FriedBob: Hmm. I blame lunar cycles.
04:17  LaraX: probably
04:19  osxdude: LaraX: yes
04:19  osxdude: lol
04:24  LaraX: remyo: I got the apple cider vinegar
04:25  remyo: LaraX: Awesome
04:26  LaraX: remyo: you said it needs to be diluted to drink but not put on your skin/hair right?
04:26  remyo: I mean you CAN drink it straight. It's just very harsh if you don't dilute it
04:26  LaraX: remyo: also I finally tasted fresh aloe and it's amazing. that bottled stuff is disgusting in comparison. tasted bad and yellowish/brown
04:26  LaraX: I had like two leaves so far
04:27  remyo: Did you get a plant?
04:27  LaraX: tastes*
04:27  LaraX: no but I got some leaves
04:27  LaraX: I'm going to use it on my skin
04:29  remyo: LaraX: Anyway, just dilute acv in water if it burns too much. Otherwise you don't need to
04:30  LaraX: remyo: I don't know how much to put in how much water but it probably says it on the bottle. it's also Bragg's 16oz
04:31  remyo: I usually put it in a tea cup. And if I dilute it about 25% of it will be water
04:31  LaraX: remyo: I just smelled it... this tastes good? :s smells like something alcoholic or something (since it's fermented)
04:31  londonmet050: what is the developer channel
04:31  remyo: londonmet050: #macdev I think
04:31  LaraX: #macdev and #macosxdev and #ipadddev I think
04:32  LaraX: there might be others
04:32  LaraX: maybe #iphonedev
04:32  remyo: Anyway. No LaraX, it doesn't taste good. It taste like vinegar and whisky
04:33  remyo: tastes*
04:33  LaraX: remyo: yeah I don't like vinegar or use it in food either, but I'll try pretty much anything healthy
04:34  remyo: If you're going to drink it just do a tablespoon every other day. Drink it quick (like whisky) and wash it out with something afterwards
04:35  LaraX: I've never drank whiskey and only gargled with apple cider vinegar before and had it in food
04:35  remyo: It hits you. You can kind of "feel it" going down.
04:36  LaraX: sounds like wheatgrass
04:36  remyo: I mean if this was out of context it would sound like awful stuff. But Apple Cider Vinegar is awesome for weight loss, boosting your metabolism, etc
04:36  LaraX: lol
04:37  LaraX: I don't need it for weight loss, maybe other things. I mostly wanted to try it for hair like you said
04:38  remyo: Go for it. 
04:38  remyo: Get as much use out of it as you can when you're single. 
04:38  remyo: It's hard to use with others around 
04:38  LaraX: uh oh
04:39  LaraX: sounds like garlic
04:39  remyo: Some (most) just don't like the smell
04:40  LaraX: I'm also going to get these: http://www.bragg.com/zencart/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=7
04:41  remyo: LaraX: One thing. It does say 5% acidity on the bottle right?
04:41  LaraX: though for the nutritional yeast I've heard it needs to stay dark for the b12 to stay active and this container is transparent
04:41  LaraX: remyo: yeah it's the same one you have
04:41  remyo: Good
04:42  remyo: The acidity is what makes it work
04:43  LaraX: is yours the 16oz too?
04:43  remyo: I've got a couple of bottles, they're both 16's
04:43  LaraX: I'm going to get the aple cider vinegar drinks too which should taste better
04:43  remyo: I think thats the defacto size
04:43  LaraX: apple*
04:44  remyo: I've been using it a lot lately 
04:44  LaraX: there's also 32 and 128 oz
04:45  LaraX: http://www.bragg.com/zencart/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1
04:45  remyo: I wonder if downing the 128 in a day would kill a man 
04:45  LaraX: maybe you should get the 32, but not the 128 since it's in plastic
04:45  LaraX: it looks like
04:45  LaraX: well don't try it!
04:46  remyo: You're not my mom
04:48  LaraX: no, I'm your big sister remember
04:49  remyo: Thats right
04:55  Branes: Has anyone got a direct download link for the VMware Fusion demo installer? Dont want to go through the online account bullshite

04:56  FriedBob: Lemme see if my (ex, since I got laid off) sysadmin does 
04:57  FriedBob: Branes: Sorry, he doesn't either
04:59  FriedBob: Does anyone actually use ping?
05:15  remyo: LaraX: Did you hear about the "back to mac" event?
05:19  Pawnee: Yep
05:21  remyo: FriedBob: I will if I can ever see a good use for it
05:22  Diverdude: it seems android will give ipods/iphones a well deserved set-back! Finally mac is beeing punished for beeing way worse than microsoft when it comes to closed platforms!
05:23  remyo: Why is it that people who don't like apple always call the entire brand "mac"?
05:24  FriedBob: remyo: I turned it on, but so far all it seems to be so far is a way for people to advertise what song/video/app they just bought
05:26  remyo: FriedBob: I think if I was selling music on iTunes I'd TOTALLY use it. But yeah, I don't see the point from the listeners perspective. 
05:27  FriedBob: Even as a content producer, I think using a more established social network, such as facebook and/or twitter would be of more benefit. Even the dying myspace
05:27  remyo: Thats what A LOT of bands still use, myspace
05:27  FriedBob: Yeah, that's why I mentioned it. It's about all it is used for now
05:28  remyo: If Ping could replace myspace maybe that would be cool
05:28  FriedBob: I don't see that happening, unless there is a way for it to have the fancy profile pages w/ the full songs playing etc
05:28  remyo: Replace it for independent artists that is
05:29  manda_moore: as long as Ping never allows custom profiles with sparkling flash graphics......... </puke>
05:29  remyo: Well Ping could do that. 
05:29  FriedBob: I use bandcloud for the little bit of music I have done (remixing and mashups)
05:29  remyo: They could at least have full song samples and slightly cusomtized iTunes Store pages.
05:30  FriedBob: THere doesn't seem to be a lot of demand for chopped and screwed Eagles songs though
05:30  remyo: Heh. I guess it depends what you mash it up with
05:31  FriedBob: On the last album I did, I mashed up a "On a Boat" with "Like a Boss", and then chopped and screwed some Bellamy Brothers, Simon & Garfunkle and The Eagles
05:32  FriedBob: I've got some ideas for future work, both chopped and screwed titles (I have an unreleased C&S of The Fat Boys - Wipe Out) and mashups I plan on doing, just not had time.
05:32  FriedBob: Eventually I will be doing a chopped and screwed version of both disks of Pink Floyd's The Wall
05:32  remyo: Mix Pet Sounds with Burt Bacharach (both of which have released raw instrumentals and vocals) and you've got me
05:33  FriedBob: I shall look into that, and will add that to my song request list.
05:33  FriedBob: My wife wants me to do The Devil Went Down to Georgia and Halo
05:33  remyo: Ugggh. Don't do anything with Halo
05:33  FriedBob: The Beyonce song
05:34  remyo: Thats a great song but it's been remixed to death
05:34  FriedBob: I likely will do it, but just for her
05:34  FriedBob: Gotta keep the wife happy afterall
05:34  remyo: Anyway, did you ever hear the album Painted from Memory that Burt Bacharach did with Elvis Costello?
05:35  remyo: I think it occured to me then that any great vocals put to Bacharach music sounds freaking awesome
05:35  FriedBob: I don't recognize the album title, but may have heard some of the songs.
05:35  remyo: Oh, it's amazing
05:35  os2mac: I have a bash syntax question. trying to grep from /etc/group and list a group's users one on each line to pipe into a while loop. How do I search and replace a "." for a newline character.
05:36  FriedBob: os2mac: Probably w/ sed or awk, but I don't know the exact syntax. Will need a regex for sure though
05:37  os2mac: what is the newline character?
05:37  remyo: FriedBob: Thats it, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_from_Memory
05:37  FriedBob: os2mac: /r or /n I think, not 100%, and the slashes may need to be the other way. Been too long since I used this.
05:38  LaraX: remyo: I hadn't, but it looks interesting
05:38  FriedBob: There is a #bash or ##bash channel that would be able to help you more if no one else is good at scripting here
05:38  remyo: LaraX: Rumored is 10.7 and new Macbook Air
05:39  remyo: And it's next week :D
05:39  LaraX: remyo: yeah, I hope so... and the iPhone on another carrier
05:39  FriedBob: iPhone on Verizon will be nice
05:39  remyo: Well they've been saying that every year since the iphone came out
05:39  LaraX: everyone has been telling me the MacBook Air will be discontinued for so long, and now these new rumors!
05:39  FriedBob: Almost enough to make me switch to Verizon instead of Sprint when my AT&T contract is up.
05:39  LaraX: FriedBob: I'm hoping it'll be on Sprint
05:40  LaraX: I have Sprint
05:40  remyo: LaraX: So if they release a new air is that what you're going to get?
05:40  LaraX: do you have an iPhone now?
05:40  FriedBob: I want to switch to Sprint cause I like their pricing. THey have a nice family plan w/ text & data, plus some nice Android phones
05:40  LaraX: remyo: depending on what it's like, probably
05:41  LSD`: No simultaneous voice/data on CDMA would suck for the iPhone on Verizon/Sprint
05:41  remyo: I want a touchscreen imac. http://www.theiloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/apple-touchscreen-imac-1.jpg
05:41  LaraX: FriedBob: I've had Sprint since the end of 1998 and like it, but recently I've been having so many problems. my ISP is Sprint too and something has been wrong with my internet the last few months, especially recently
05:41  LSD`: I can wait for that. The UI isn't there yet, not to mention it gets painful tapping away at a vertical screen for extended periods
05:42  remyo: Yeah
05:43  FriedBob: I had sprint before I got married, then switched to AT&T cause that's what she had and most of my family (and people I called regularly) had
05:43  remyo: I wonder how major 10.7 will be. Probably won't have the $30 price tag again.
05:43  FriedBob: I want an ARM Mac. :D
05:44  LaraX: remyo: I hope I remember about that event, unless I'm on IRC I usually don't know about these things, at least right away. this is like my RSS feed :)
05:44  LSD`: FriedBob: only if they're able to increase ARM performance 1000x in a reasonable space of time
05:44  LSD`: remyo: I'm almost positive 10.7 will drop support for 32-bit EFI machines :/
05:44  remyo: LaraX: I use a tasklist web app that reminds me of things through my iPhone. So that day I'll get a message that say "Back to mac event today"
05:45  remyo: You could do something similar
05:45  LaraX: remyo: I use Google Calendar and am sure I can put it there, but haven't been using it for things like that. have a MobileMe trial too
05:46  LaraX: Google has a tasks thing too
05:46  londonmet050: where is macports channel
05:46  londonmet050: the macdev guys are like no system configuration stuff here
05:47  remyo: I'm addicted to use a tasklist. In whatever form. I can dump everything I need to do into it and not have to think about it while I'm not handling it. 
05:47  remyo: to using*
05:47  LaraX: I never use to do lists but probably should
05:47  LaraX: londonmet050: #macports ?
05:47  FriedBob: remyo: Integration with FB and Twitter and maybe Buzz would make Ping a lot more useful in general I think
05:48  remyo: FriedBob: Why?
05:48  londonmet050: lara ta
05:48  LaraX: remyo: I use browser tabs as a to do list too, the pages remind me of things
05:48  LSD`: Apple need to stop beating around the bush and just flat out rip off Last.fm
05:48  remyo: Ugh. last.fm sucks. But you're right.
05:49  FriedBob: Or Grooveshark
05:49  LaraX: Buzz is annoying, I just told it I don't want to use it in a new Google account I've been using and it added it to my Gmail anyway
05:50  LaraX: it's like they want to force/trick you into using things
05:50  remyo: Right now I feel like an old man about every social service. I'm just like "Whats the point?"
05:50  FriedBob: I'm not sure how I feel about Buzz. It's almost like a the worst of RSS and Twitter
05:50  londonmet050: what is buzz
05:50  londonmet050: is that  ping
05:50  londonmet050: thing
05:51  FriedBob: I do realy enjoy twitter though, but I am picky about who I follow and engage with.
05:51  LaraX: I hate how it publishes your chat status messages as if it's something that needs to be permanent... AIM does the same thing too now. I don't even change my status any more because of this
05:51  LSD`: The biggest problem I have with Last.fm right now is every time I sync my iPhone I crap myself because I'm afraid it'll crash iTunes and possibly take my iPhone with it
05:51  FriedBob: Buzz is a Google ran social network of sorts, almost like their version of Twitter
05:51  FriedBob: I told last.fm to not open w/ itunes anymore, but it still does half the time
05:52  LaraX: I don't understand Twitter either or use it
05:52  FriedBob: I use twitter a lot. Helps me connect with foodies, pipe and cigar smokers, DJs/producers/bands/etc
05:53  FriedBob: Accountants and auditors too
05:53  LaraX: are the foodies local?
05:53  FriedBob: semi.
05:53  LaraX: or can you search for people by certain criteria, or just follow subjects?
05:53  LaraX: or peopl
05:53  FriedBob: I follow a lot of famous chefs, as well as local restaruants
05:53  LaraX: e
05:54  remyo: LaraX: Oh by the way. The area I'm moving to is a VERY raw food / vegan-centric place 
05:54  FriedBob: I have local people and businesses I follow, but in 3-4 different areas since I have moved a few times over the last few years
05:54  remyo: It's going to be great
05:54  LaraX: remyo: good :) I want to live in an area like that
05:54  remyo: I'm SURE there are places like that in NY
05:54  FriedBob: LaraX: You can search by topic and by region, esp if you use a couple of 3rd party sites to enhance the search
05:54  LSD`: I'd rather be as far away from those smelly hippies as possible
05:55  LaraX: remyo: I want to move but stay in this city, most of these places aren't too close to me
05:56  FriedBob: I don't want to do the whole vegan thing, but I do beleive in eating local when possible, and want to open a restaurant that only uses locally sourced in season ingredients
05:56  LaraX: LSD`: anyone would smell if they don't take a shower... and not all of them don't take showers
05:56  LaraX: FriedBob: where are you?
05:57  FriedBob: LaraX: Bouncing back and forth between southwest & central/north east MO right now
05:57  FriedBob: Hope to wind up settling down near KC
05:58  LaraX: I think I asked you, but does your nick refer to fried food?
05:58  FriedBob: Only vaguely
05:58  FriedBob: This nick was originally "Fried Green Bob". A combination reference to Veggie Tales & fried green tomatoes.
05:59  FriedBob: Bob being the tomatoe on Veggie Tales.
05:59  LaraX: remyo: there are more places like that downtown and in some areas in Brooklyn. I might move to Queens or Brooklyn but would rather stay in Manhattan
05:59  remyo: I used to LOVE Fried green tomatoes when I was a kid 
05:59  FriedBob: I like the song. NEver had actual fried green tomatoes though
06:00  remyo: No kidding.
06:00  londonmet050: any one knew any client that uses RDP
06:00  remyo: LaraX: Manhattan is actually usually where I am when I'm in NY
06:00  londonmet050: aqua connect is commerical I looking for freeware
06:00  FriedBob: londonmet050: MS makes an official RDP client
06:00  londonmet050: for osx?
06:00  FriedBob: Yeah, at least they used to
06:00  LaraX: people actually eat fried green tomatoes, the food?
06:01  LSD`: yes, hit up mactopia
06:01  FriedBob: I have it on my 10.4 PPC mac
06:01  remyo: LaraX: Oh yes
06:01  FriedBob: LaraX: Yeah, but not much outside the deep south
06:01  LSD`: There's also CoRD, but I prefer the MS one
06:01  LaraX: what does it taste like?
06:01  remyo: It's a southern thing for sure
06:01  FriedBob: The MS one works really well
06:02  LaraX: remyo: where do you stay when you're here?
06:02  remyo: LaraX: I've stayed at a few different hotels. They're very cheap in that area.
06:02  FriedBob: I shoulda visited NYC while I was living in Baltimore. Gonna be a lot more of a hassle to visit now
06:03  LaraX: remyo: cheap in what area, Manhattan? not really... unless it's some seedy place
06:03  LSD`: FriedBob: Yeah, CoRD had scaling issues last time I tried it
06:03  FriedBob: LSD`: I've never used anything but the MS client. My only complaint was having to use an external 2/3 button mouse.
06:03  LaraX: remyo: I stayed at some really cheap hotel in Times Square once
06:03  FriedBob: control-click didn't work in the client
06:03  remyo: LaraX: Well I wasn't staying in the nice ones :p. But they do have "not-so-horrible" hotels there that aren't expensive 
06:04  LSD`: FriedBob: You can set it up to allow the use of modifiers to simulate the extra buttons iirc
06:04  FriedBob: LSD`: Hmm. Doesn't matter now though.
06:04  LaraX: remyo: I think this place had a shared bathroom in the hallway, and a sink in the room, or something
06:04  FriedBob: I have no reason to use it ATM since I got laid off and won't be doing remote support anymore.
06:05  remyo: Yeah... But if you're in Ny, especially if you're just visiting you don't spend a ton of time in the hotel anyway
06:05  LaraX: remyo: have you stayed in a youth hostel?
06:05  remyo: Not yet
06:05  FriedBob: 3-4 hours/morning to recharge enough to stay out all night again. :)
06:05  LSD`: Yeah, I can't really use it anymore either since my Windows server trial expired and my other Windows machine is Home Premium, so no Remote Desktop support without hacking
06:05  FriedBob: My winbox at home is Win7 Ultimate
06:06  LaraX: those are pretty cheap, but some have shared rooms, etc
06:06  remyo: FriedBob: The last time I was in Ny I spent SO MUCH time at this place called Mannys Music. Have you heard of it?
06:06  FriedBob: remyo: No. Never been to NYC.
06:06  remyo: If you do you should go there. It's this really awesome guitar shop
06:06  LSD`: FriedBob: I bought Home Premium because it was AUD$150 for the upgrade and I didn't really need the extra fluff Professional and above include
06:06  remyo: I kept going back day after day so I could try all the different guitars. I think they got annoyed with me
06:07  FriedBob: LSD`: I have Ultimate cause I hosted a launch party
06:07  remyo: But I found this awesome Martin that I still play all the time
06:07  remyo: LaraX: You've been to the Met right?
06:07  FriedBob: It's the "Signature Edition" - Has Balmer's autograph stamped on it
06:08  LSD`: If I still had access to MSDNAA then I would have grabbed Professional for free, but I don't and Home Premium was more than enough to play StarCraft II (in the absence of a powerful enough Mac) >:D
06:08  LSD`: FriedBob: along with DEVELOPERS! DEVELOPERS! DEVELOPERS! DEVELOPERS! ?
06:08  LaraX: remyo: museum or opera?
06:08  FriedBob: LSD`: That must be what those runes mean
06:08  remyo: LaraX: the metropolitan museum of art.
06:08  FriedBob: The ones that look like they were done in dried blood.
06:09  LaraX: yeah
06:09  remyo: Thats a place I think about ALL the time. When I got to New York again thats the first place I'm hitting
06:09  remyo: when I go*
06:10  FriedBob: LSD`: Oddly enough, I am more amused than intrigued at the idea of win7mobile.
06:11  remyo: In Atlanta we have the michael carlos museum and the high museum of art. But they're no met. 
06:11  LaraX: remyo: my favorite NY artist is probably Saxton Freymann, I want to go food shopping with him: http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&q=%22saxton%20freymann%22&rlz=1B3GPCK_enUS398US398&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1280&bih=649 :)
06:11  FriedBob: remyo: BTW, my next project will be Under Pressure vs Ice Ice Baby. Trying to decide how I want to title it.
06:12  remyo: FriedBob: You could call it On This Ice but I think thats a Pink Floyd song :p
06:13  remyo: LaraX: You've showed me these before. It's awesome
06:13  FriedBob: "On Thin Ice" is the Floyd song.
06:13  FriedBob: From The Wall
06:13  remyo: Yeah! Thats right
06:13  remyo: I have the Wall (on Vinyl and cd) but I haven't listened to it in ages. 
06:14  FriedBob: The Wall & Dark Side of The Moon are two of my favorite albums, ever.
06:14  remyo: Roger Waters has been touring on them. I got to see one of the Dark Side tours
06:14  remyo: A year or so ago
06:15  remyo: I think he's touring on The Wall right now
06:15  FriedBob: There was a Floyd tribute band that played while I was in Baltimore. Didn't get to go, but from what I was told, it was as close to being at a real Pink Floyd concert as you can get
06:16  remyo: Do you know what the band was called?
06:17  FriedBob: I can't remember, it was about a year ago
06:17  FriedBob: They were a local or regional band though I think
06:17  remyo: When Syd Barrett died there was a local bar that held a tribute show for him. And a ton of local artists came out to perform. 
06:17  remyo: All dressed like Syd. Even the girls
06:18  FriedBob: That would have been something to see
06:19  LaraX: :|
06:19  remyo: LaraX: Whats wrong?
06:19  FriedBob: Freeze up again?
06:20  LaraX: remyo: just that I froze... again...
06:20  remyo: AH :(
06:20  LaraX: it's freezing as often as it used to just disconnect
06:21  LaraX: yeah
06:21  EdLin: FriedBob: did they play any of the real old stuff, like Saucerful of Secrets?
06:21  LaraX: hi EdLin
06:21  EdLin: hi
06:21  FriedBob: EdLin: I think so, but sadly, I did not get to go. I didn't find out about it in time
06:21  EdLin: FriedBob: I loved their live performance of that in "Live at Pompeii"
06:21  remyo: EdLin: Thats a great album 
06:22  EdLin: yep, it's even better live from the Floyd themselves. Roger Waters really likes hitting that gong. :)
06:22  FriedBob: Is there a way to add/change the visualizer in iTunes other than just the "iTunes Visualizer" and "iTunes Classic Visualizer" ?
06:23  remyo: EdLin: Did you ever get to see them? 
06:23  EdLin: remyo: no, seeing the video is as close as I've gotten.
06:24  EdLin: remyo: now that Rick Wright is gone, the band will never be again.
06:24  remyo: Yeah :(
06:24  remyo: And they weren't really together much before he passed anyway
06:24  EdLin: even assuming that Roger Waters and Dave Gillmour bury the hatchet
06:25  remyo: I got to see Roger Waters live. 
06:25  remyo: He has a really tight band and he sounds good. But it didn't feel as magical as it would have with any of the other members 
06:26 * EdLin is listening to Pink Floyd - One of These Days, from the album Meddle [5:58 mins] [256 kbps AAC] [11.21 MB] [played 2 times]
06:26  FriedBob: remyo: Dropping acid would likely help with that.
06:26  remyo: Thats the other thing. Pink Floyd is such a mainstream band now that the concert really wasn't one where you could drop acid
06:27  remyo: Like there were a lot of older people there with there kids and stuff like that
06:27  remyo: I imagine back in the day it would have felt a lot hipper 
06:29  EdLin: ever heard early Tangerine Dream? They sound a bit like Pink Floyd.
06:29  remyo: Yep
06:29  EdLin: they kind of went into the new age stuff and movie soundtracks later though
06:30  EdLin: hard to believe they were one of the loudest bands at one point.
06:30  remyo: Well Pink Floyds sound totally changed over the years too. You listen to Piper and then Final Cut and you'd think they were two different bands 
06:31  EdLin: well, piper's unique, it has psychadelic telecaster riffs.
06:31  EdLin: their sound changed radically when Syd left.
06:31  EdLin: not badly of course, just different
06:32  remyo: But even after Syd, they constantly changed. 
06:32  EdLin: the stuff after Roger left though I don't like much.
06:32  EdLin: remyo: true.
06:32  remyo: Like compare Ummagumma to The Wall
06:32  remyo: You can't
06:32  EdLin: true, ummaguma is very experiemental.
06:33  EdLin: I don't know why it's the band's least favorite album.
06:34  remyo: Between the noise theres some very pretty stuff on it
06:34  FriedBob: Heh. Poor visualizer, it's not liking this Dragonforce song too much.
06:34  EdLin: yeah, and some of Dave Gillmore's best singing.
06:34  EdLin: Gillmour*
06:35  remyo: EdLin: Did you ever hear David Gilmours "On an Island" 
06:35  remyo: The album
06:35  EdLin: remyo: I think so, I had his first solo album, but that was a different one.
06:36  remyo: On an Island is so beautiful. There are a couple of songs that get me close to crying
06:36  EdLin: he did his first solo album when roger and he were still in the band.
06:36  remyo: Yeah
06:36  EdLin: it was OK, sounded like Pink Floyd. ;-)
06:36  remyo: On an Island was semi-recent. Like 2006?
06:36  EdLin: I haven't heard any of the Syd Barret albums, any good?
06:36  remyo: OH YES
06:37  remyo: Especially if you like Piper
06:37  remyo: But they're a lot softer. A lot of the songs are unfinished and sound almost demo-ish
06:38  remyo: Apparently it was a struggle to get them recorded with Syds state of being at the time
06:38  LaraX: Tangerine Dream, the music in Risky Business, right?
06:38  EdLin: LaraX: that's their later style.
06:39 * LaraX <3's 80s music/movies
06:39  EdLin: LaraX: I do too, I did like "on a train" from that movie.
06:39  EdLin: or on a real train, or something like that.
06:39  LaraX: EdLin: I don't know the specific song names, just in general
06:40  remyo: LaraX: Whats you favorite 80's album?
06:40 * EdLin is listening to The Human League - Don't You Want Me (2002 Digital Remaster), from the album Dare! [3:56 mins] [273 kbps MP3] [7.75 MB] [played 1 times]
06:40  LaraX: remyo: I don't know that I have one
06:40  LaraX: I used to love Madonna
06:40  EdLin: love the bass line to that
06:41  LaraX: that's a nice song
06:41  LaraX: remyo: I used to also listen to Latin freestyle a lot
06:41  EdLin: it's got a great synthesizer bass sound, I've been trying to exactly duplicate it with my synth, I have the feeling to do it I'd need real analog.
06:42  LaraX: and synthpop I guess it's called
06:42  FriedBob: Speaking of
06:42  FriedBob: I need to find my copy of The M Factor
06:42  FriedBob: I think that is the title
06:43  remyo: The book?
06:43  LSD`: I found a new respect for 80s synth music when it hit me that a lot of that old analogue gear was mono-timbral and you sometimes have half a dozen seperate tracks all playing at the same time
06:43  FriedBob: No, the song
06:43  EdLin: LSD`: even new analog gear is often monophonic.
06:44  EdLin: LSD`: one note at a time, no courds. One exception is DSI's midrange and high end stuff.
06:44  LaraX: I'm going to go before I freeze again, goodnight
06:44  FriedBob: Night
06:44  remyo: See ya
06:45  LSD`: EdLin: better still is needing a seperately programmed synth for each individual track because of the mono-timbralness :P
06:45  EdLin: LSD`: yeah, my Radias is a breeze in that regard, I can even split the keyboard into two synths and add a drum track, all with one synth.
06:45  Branes: Let me link you to a track that'll blow your bloody minds, then :)
06:45  EdLin: but it's VA
06:46 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
06:47 * Branes isn't a fan of VA synths
06:47  EdLin: Branes: I'm thinking of getting a Moog for Hannukah, but that's expensive.
06:48  EdLin: I'll be poor for about 5 months paying it off if I get it.
06:48  Branes: It'd be cheaper to build a nice monophonic
06:48  EdLin: that's a cool idea.
06:49  EdLin: I haven't handled a soldering iron for about 15 years though. ;-)
06:49  Branes: There's a huge wealth of synthdiy out there.
06:51 * Branes kicks dropbox's slow uploads
06:52  Branes: Ah.
06:52  Branes: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/532297/Amin%20Bhatia-Flight%20Beyond%20The%20Stars.mp3
06:52  Branes: Grab that.
06:52  Branes: LSD`: You too. Give it a listen. Then I'll tell you the track's brief history :)
06:53 * LSD` stabs QuickTime
06:54  LSD`: It's infested my Opera MIME types, on Windows no less, so now any media file gets shunted to the plugin instead of prompting to download. Better again is how there's over nine thousand items so nuking them one by one would be a pain >_<
06:57  FriedBob: Branes: Kinda reminds me a little of some of the OSTs I have (Bleach, RHL & Alone in the Dark, specifically)
06:59  Branes: What if I told you that was written & performed by one man using one synth (a monophonic, non-programmable Minimoog) and a single 4-track reel-to-reel recorder in 1979?
06:59  FriedBob: Nice
07:00  LSD`: I'd say people using modern multi-track, multi-timbral and polyphonic gear don't know how easy they have it :P
07:00  Branes: The reason for the high noise factor is that there's up to thirty generations of tape-bounce in some sections.
07:00  FriedBob: This TSO video for Requiem (The Fifth) is even more haunting than their version of the song itself is.
07:01  FriedBob: And I think the jack on my soundcard is going out. :(
07:04  EdLin: Branes: moogs have this wonderful "breathing" quality, works great for brassy sounds.
07:05  EdLin: Branes: I like this track, it's rare nowadys for people to use a synth to try to make orchestral sounds.
07:05  Branes: Despite its age, its still a damned impresive track, the fact it's all done with a single-voice instrument boggles the mind.
07:05  FriedBob: Yeah
07:06  EdLin: Branes: the minimoog had 3 osscilators. :)
07:06  Branes: Are you familiar with the work of Isao Tomita?
07:06  EdLin: no
07:06  Branes: I know, Ed, but it's still a single voice instrument :)
07:08  Branes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Tomita
07:08  EdLin: Branes: make some of them a bit different tuned, and you can make it sound almost like it doesn't have just one voice. Still, that music was impressive.
07:09  Branes: Became very famous in the 80s for his renditions of classical pieces, including Snowflakes Are Dancing, the Firebird Suite, and got into trouble for doing a version of Holst's 'Planets' suite. His synthesis techniques are beautiful.
07:09  FriedBob: Hmm, I think this song I bought has the new female lead, not the first one. Maybe I should have bought the studio copy instead. :/ Ohw ell, she still sounds good, just not as powerful on this song.
07:10  FriedBob: (Nightwish - 7 Days to the Wolves (Live) )
07:10  EdLin: Branes: ah, Star Hustler. RIP Jack Horkheimer.
07:11  EdLin: Branes: you probably never saw star hustler, on PBS, an amature astronomy program for kids.
07:11  EdLin: Branes: his theme music was from Isao Tomita
07:12  FriedBob: Well, I am crashing, so night y'all
07:14  Branes: dream well

11:16  mustardseed: flimmern: you simply buy applecare and give apple your MB serial number, they will link it
11:47  bassliner: so what's the preferred way to disable the annoying startup sound on a macbook?
11:51  _KaszpiR_: put headphones to tje minijack ;D
11:53  bassliner: _KaszpiR_: as funny as that attempt is, it wouldn't even work.

11:57  Zelfje: anyone got a  Logitech Webcam Webcam C910 working good on osx?
11:57  bassliner: wakeupscreaming: i've been there and i'm able to use google, but thank you. that's why i was asking for the *preferred* way to turn it off. Psst uses a method that turns the volume down on system shutdown and raises it on system startup and there is another way that some ppl prefere, which is why i was asking what method to use. a 3rd way would be to actually run shell scripts to do so on both events.
11:59  Zelfje: anyone got the Logitech Webcam Webcam C910 working good on osx?
12:12  iaj: does anyone know on howto have more access to itunes via keyboard... eg wind forward, backward?

15:20  diamonds: hispaniola.mydomain.local
15:20  js_: can i make the built in vnc client update more often? when i vnc to a windows machine and enter a folder, i have to move the folder for the window to update
15:20  diamonds: ahh...
15:20  diamonds: maybe it has to do with the domain?
15:20  bassliner: diamonds: maybe you got that name while you got a new IP from a DHCP?
15:21  diamonds: well I forgot to mention I was home yesterday and at work today :)
15:21  bassliner: diamonds: then maybe that's it
15:21  diamonds: but I swear it wasn't like this before!
15:21  bassliner: diamonds: what does "nslookup hispaniola" say?
15:21  diamonds: I think it's a combo of that and the mac update
15:21  diamonds: local address
15:22  bassliner: diamonds: it'd be of interest if it stays like that when you get home (or into another network with a dhcpd)
15:22  diamonds: ok

15:41  ayaz: hi guys
15:43  ayaz: i've an external lcd which supports a max resolution of 1680x1050. when i hook it up to my macbook via a mini-dvi to vga adapter, looking at the lcd instantly puts a lot of strain on my eyes. i have played with all sorts of settings both on the lcd and on os x but to no avail. do you think switching to the mini-dvi to dvi adapter help? the lcd in question has both vga and dvi inputs.
15:44 @Tu13es: ayaz: did you have the LCD auto-adjust after plugging it in?
15:44  ayaz: Tu13es: yes, i did.
15:44 @Tu13es: hm
15:44 @Tu13es: i wouldn't expect vga to be _that_ bad
15:45  ayaz: Tu13es: it isn't that bad. i mean, apart from the fonts looking a bit jagged, it is fine. and i don't mind it. but the fact that it causes a lot of strain on my eyes is something i can't overlook.
15:46 @Tu13es: i do generally prefer dvi to vga, but i can't say for sure if it'll be a noticable difference
15:46 @Tu13es: methinks something else is wrong as well
15:51  ayaz: i asked this on superuser a while back. the bottom line, of all the answers i got, was that i should get a dvi adapter. i am just sceptical that it would work.
15:51  ayaz: http://superuser.com/questions/183604/why-do-i-feel-a-strain-on-my-eyes-when-i-look-at-the-19-matte-display
15:56 @Tu13es: i'm using two identical displays, one on DVI, one on VGA.  I can tell the difference if I look closely, but I don't notice otherwise
15:57  ayaz: i see, okay. then there's likely something else wrong, but i am not sure what it could be.
16:00  ayaz: i'm sorry, i've to power cycle the router. i'll be back in a bit.
16:00  ayaz: thanks for you time, Tu13es!

16:51  envirocbr: Hey fellow mac users
16:52  envirocbr: I have a imac 27" and my fellow co-worker replaced the dead HDD with a WD Green Label 500GB HDD. Now the fan is ALWAYS on full speeed and they are having issues with the system freezing...any ideas?
16:53  envirocbr: Do you think the drive is not compatible? I know macs (in the past) were particular with their hardware compatibility
16:53  zer0her0: could be
16:53  Angostura: What do the temperature sensors say?
16:53  zer0her0: also you sure you connected the sensor on the drive tray again?
16:53  Angostura: (Grab iStatPro or quivalent)
16:53  envirocbr: I am not sure, I have to go on site to see what is going on and I don't have much experience with mac based machines, even though I know they are Unix in the backend
16:53  zer0her0: (actually not even sure where the sensors are on the 27, haven't taken one apart yet)
16:53  envirocbr: zer0her0: He says he connected it
16:53  Angostura: So what are they reading?
16:54  envirocbr: zer0her0: Shocking, as we have replaced 5 27" HDD's
16:54  envirocbr: Angostura: Is this through lmsensors or is there another CLI command to use or is it a GUI thing?
16:54  zer0her0: envirocbr: i'd follow Angostura's suggestion and grab iStatPro and do a checking on what the sensors are reading
16:54  Angostura: http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatpro/
16:55  envirocbr: Thanks, I will install that and take a peek

17:29  CyberdogX: bummer. had to buy my nieces two PC laptops instead of macbooks
17:30  zer0her0: CyberdogX: ouch, why
17:33  CyberdogX: price
17:33  CyberdogX: got two core 2 duo laptops from Dell Financial Services for 236.00 each. manufactuere refurbs
17:33  b3ny0-: my parents got a compaq about a year ago
17:33  b3ny0-: needless to say, they aren't that pleased with it
17:34  CyberdogX: that's Windows
17:34  zer0her0: CyberdogX: wow nice
17:34  b3ny0-: crappy hardware + vista
17:34  zer0her0: b3ny0-: hehe
17:34  b3ny0-: you can see the leafes on the trees outside change color in the time it takes for it to start
17:34  envirocbr: lol
17:34  CyberdogX: yeah, good price
17:35  zer0her0: haha
17:35  CyberdogX: they have more. both at Overstock and eBay
17:36  CyberdogX: My Mom has a Dell. if she would just have called me, i would have counciled her to get a Mini
17:36  b3ny0-: I'll probably end up helping them get 7 onto it someday
17:37  CyberdogX: i'm getting 7 and Office 10 for my nieces
17:37  CyberdogX: gonna put more ram in too. comes with 2 gig
17:37  CyberdogX: i meant 1 gig
17:37  CyberdogX: 2 would have been fine, i'm going to see if i can get 4
17:37  b3ny0-: that should make it at least a little bit faster
17:38  bdelin88: or you can spend stupid amounts of money and get 8 like me, lol... kind of regretting it now
17:38  CyberdogX: DELL LATITUDE D620 Wifi Vista
17:38  CyberdogX: 4 should do them
17:39  zer0her0: I think I may need to move to 16GB soon
17:39  zer0her0: though I may see if I can argue for a new MacPro w/ 16GB first...
17:39  b3ny0-: a lot of people are put off by the pricing of macs
17:40  b3ny0-: I was too for a long time
17:40  b3ny0-: but I really didn't want a laptop with windows on it
17:40  CyberdogX: they're worth it. Apple just doesn't make a cheap computer like Dell does. they don't want to fight for scraps at the bottom of the market.
17:40  zer0her0: eh they last so much longer
17:41  zer0her0: This MacPro is 2.5 years old at this point and realistically is fine for another couple years, though it would be nice to have a faster machine for some work
17:41  b3ny0-: I am pleased with it and I wouldn't want to trade it for anything else
17:41  bdelin88: solid build construction on the MBP's, unmatched by any other makers at this time :)
17:41  b3ny0-: at apples standard pricing, it is still a bit pricey though
17:42  bdelin88: the macbook air can always be had at a reasonable price
17:42  zer0her0: hm, looks like 6grand for my next machine...
17:42  bdelin88: or even the 13" MBP
17:42  b3ny0-: I was lucky enough to catch a sale on MBP 13" which was substancially cheaper
17:42  CyberdogX: Apple made some road apples though. almost any iBook after the 1st gen iBook 600
17:42  CyberdogX: they all get that video problem, or they can. mine didn't though.
17:43  b3ny0-: I couldn't live without a multitouch trackpad on a laptop now
17:43  CyberdogX: had an iBook 700 for a long time, then my wife took it for a while before we sold it
17:43  zer0her0: yea that's one of my big things, the trackpad on apple's are so nice
17:43  CyberdogX: they are
17:44  b3ny0-: one of the main reason I've never been a big fan of laptops has been that abomination of perephiral they called the trackpad
17:44  CyberdogX: i use seperate keyboard and mouse with mine
17:44  zer0her0: ruh roh, how did I miss this, Adobe possibly be bought by MS
17:45  b3ny0-: apple is the only company so far that actually made it not only usable, but useful :)
17:47  CyberdogX: what? say it ain't so!
17:48  vxla: is 8GB of ram the top limit of the current (2010) MBP's? or can one fit in more if they put in two DIMMs?
17:48  b3ny0-: still won't replace an actual mouse for the precision-fiddling, but they are a good combo
17:51 --- somebody_ is now known as anthronaut
17:52  b3ny0-: wouldn't had hurt to have a third usb-port though
17:52 --- klaasvaak is now known as Zelfje
17:52  b3ny0-: and an ordinary displayport instead of the mini-variant which is completely pointless the way I see it
17:53  CyberdogX: if MS buys Adobe the universe will collapse
17:54  b3ny0-: heh
17:55  b3ny0-: well look on the bright side, it might result in flash working decently on at least ONE platform
17:57  CyberdogX: there's no bright side
17:58  vxla: hmm looks like it will be a hardware upgrade for any more than 8GB of ram eventually.
17:58  vxla: ho hum
18:02  FriedBob: zer0her0: AOL may be buying Yahoo!
18:02  zer0her0: FriedBob: wait those companies still exist?
18:03  FriedBob: zer0her0: Yeah, I know. Shocking huh?
18:03  FriedBob: I wish Menards would hurry up and call.
