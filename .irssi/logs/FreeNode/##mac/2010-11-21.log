19:15  mijk: question: what exactly IS Boot Camp? Is it an emulator within Mac OS or does it simply allow you to boot natively into Windows?
19:17 @ChrisAM: It's a partitioner & a set of drivers.
19:17 @ChrisAM: you don't *need* bootcamp to run Windows on a mac, but it allows you to dual boot and supplies the drivers for the Apple hardware.
19:18 @ChrisAM: You could use rEFIt to replace the bootloader, but it would be hard to find non-apple drivers to make Windows recognize the hardware.
19:19  mijk: ah ha! okay, that's a lot clearer
19:20  mijk: okay, so x86 CPU only then
19:20  S_SubZero: yes
19:20  mijk: perfect

20:43  Quatroking: Oh, by the way, I'm running Mac OS 9.22
20:43  S_SubZero: then Toast.
20:44  Quatroking: Is that a free app?

21:02  fujisan: neither do i :d
21:03  torchie: His parents hoped he would become a doctor. Mother: "He would not listen. Sometimes I hit him with a stick but he continued to play games, but a stubborn child. "Villagers have been surprised at the career of Sky and acquired wealth.

21:06  fujisan: that used to mean something in the world being dutch :)
21:06  fujisan: Dutch people used to be the most tolerant people in the world
21:07  fujisan: but then... indoctrination and populism and a lot of stupid people who never knew about the VOC history ruined it
