00:15  pokerl: hi!
00:15  pokerl: need assistance!
00:15  pokerl: need to put the display preferences to default... mirroring is checked.. and when i plug in the external display i only see colored distortions (stripes), only the mouse pointer is crisp clear visible... so i need to do it per commandline because, preferences for external display and mirroring only appear when ext. disp. is conn.
00:17  pokerl: brb, pleas dont be shy, answer while i am away.  ;*)  ... I'll read it later! THX in forward advance!!

00:39  Angostura: What's the external display?
00:47  pgpkeys: external display is any monitor or projector you connect to the system
01:02  Angostura: Errr, thanks :-) I was asking pokerl about the model

04:34 * Cam sits in his corner
04:35  seltz: hehe
04:35  seltz: i thought it was going to be raccoon.conf or something, but i was wrong
04:35  pgpkeys: and nothing wrong with running Mac OS X Server
04:39  seltz: so, no idea where vpn configs get stored? I assumed they stored down to basic .conf files
04:40  pgpkeys: i dont know sorry
04:41  seltz: ah, it's cool
04:42  seltz: well, the dns settings end up in resolv.conf
04:46  pgpkeys: yeah all dns entries are in resolv.conf for nameservers and /etc/hosts for named IPs on most unix systems

04:59  piklu: hello
04:59  piklu: i feel like my macbook pro's key are becoming hard everyday
05:00  pgpkeys: feels like that on this macbook 13" too sometimes
05:00  LSD`: I haven't noticed any difference on mine
05:00  pgpkeys: or like certain keys fail to respond unless you hit them juuuust right
05:00  piklu: yeah, i have 13" 2010
05:00  piklu: I feel like they are not soft anymore as they came to me.
05:00  EM03: i dropped my white macbook yesterday from counter top height. it first hit near the fromt of the trackpad then the top bezel of the lcd 
05:01  LSD`: ouch :(
05:01  EM03: damage is very minimal you can't even really see it 
05:01  pgpkeys: piklu: mine has an excuse. its circa 2007
05:01  EM03: but i wonder if i jarred anything loose or messed up the lcd color gamut or something weird
05:01  EM03: how solid is this stuff?
05:01  pgpkeys: oh quite solid
05:01  EM03: the scratches on the bezel you can only feel you can't even see 
05:01  LSD`: EM03: you want to keep an eye on it, you may have a hairline crack in your LCD that looks fine now, but eventually will spider out and require replacement
05:01  pgpkeys: this macbook has been dropped, shipped, beaten, and was owned by a 13yo before i got it
05:02  jeffszusz: pgpkeys: my roommate's mac worked for six months after his heatsink fell off the motherboard before he had to bring it in for repair.
05:02  piklu: so what shall i do ? take it to apple.
05:02  EM03: on the front if you look super close on the trackpad well on the outside of the case near it you can see a super small dent ....only from certain angles
05:03  EM03: LSD`: i dont think there was any hit on the lcd itself 
05:03  EM03: and the bezel damage is just a scratch
05:03  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: hehe tough little buggers these macs :)
05:03  EM03: from how high it was i am surprised its not way more messed up
05:04  EM03: honestly still looks brand new, just have to look suuuper close
05:04  LSD`: EM03: The toshiba A100 I scored from a former roommate was dropped, thrown around, beaten and never showed any damage until one day, out of the blue, a massive crack appeared in the LCD
05:04  EM03: but i dont want to jar loose the led backlit or something weird 
05:04  pgpkeys: my case on this macbook has the right edge where your arm usually sits when typing all chipped and stuff, but other than that and the greying of the white casing due to age.. not a thing wrong
05:04  EM03: this is only a month old 
05:05  EM03: im gonna get a mabook 17 pro when the new ones come out 
05:05  EM03: so this is my temp computer
05:05  EM03: ive never dropped a laptop before and out of all laptops macbook is the last one i would want to 
05:05  pgpkeys: i plan on buying the 2.8GHz i7 17" macbook with 8GB RAM and 7200rpm 500GB drive when my retro check comes.
05:06  pgpkeys: with all the little adapters and stuff and the upgrades i just mentioned it comes out to about $3700 USD
05:06  LSD`: heh, I'm waiting for the Sandy Bridge 13" Pro with the Intel HD 3000 graphics :D
05:07  EM03: im waiting for sandy as well 
05:07  EM03: or i would not have this right now 
05:07  pgpkeys: one thing I'm making damn sure to buy is the Apple extended warranty.
05:08  piklu: pgpkeys, how much for 13"? 2010
05:08  piklu: i wanna buy for this one
05:08  piklu: i knw it ll need keyboard check
05:08  pgpkeys: i would have to look. baseline is 999 iirc
05:08  LSD`: I just want the Intel PCH instead of the nVidia POS the 13" currently use. The fact it adds Intel graphics is just a bonus.
05:09  pgpkeys: LSD`: hehe i can't play a single game worth a damn for 1st person shooters on this one that i have now. but its awesome and 'just right' for coding and for playing the age of empires 3, and rome - total war. 
05:09  pgpkeys: plus it hands angry birds just fine :)
05:09  EM03: what one?
05:10  EM03: i like to keep macbooks completely clean and immaculate, but now f it first scratch even though i wouldn't even notice without looking super hard 
05:10  EM03: i hate it though 
05:10  pgpkeys: EM03: the one i have now. 13" November 2007 macbook (white)
05:10  pgpkeys: yeah i get like that with any of my systems. I gave my mom my AMD64 HP CQ61-250 laptop.. it had a single scratch on the cover (really light scratch too) and I almost didn't give it to her because of it 
05:11  pgpkeys: but i know i'm anal like that
05:11  LSD`: pgpkeys: The GMA950 in mine now handles more than I was expecting to, honestly. The HD 3000 IGP in Sandy Bridge is better again, but even if it weren't I'd still prefer it over some power sucking discrete or semi-discrete thing
05:11  jeffszusz: pgpkeys: quite tough!
05:12  pgpkeys: LSD`: this is a GMA X3100
05:12  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: yeah i just have this thing for pristine 
05:13  pgpkeys: LSD`: hrmm you know.. i was an idiot and didn't check to see what graphics card is in the 2010 17" mbp
05:13  EM03: i think this 2.4 ghz core 2 duo is almost non usable speed wise pgpkeys  i dont know how you do it 
05:13  pgpkeys: EM03: oh cause i'm not doing anything super intensive beyond compiling and i expect compiles to take a bit :)
05:13  EM03: i had to show someone the damage and it took me like 3 minutes for them to see if .....i guess the all white unibody contruction is prettty strong 
05:14  EM03: i do photoshop textmate et 
05:14  EM03: c
05:14  EM03: i think anything less than a core i6 is not worth it 
05:14  LSD`: lol
05:15  EM03: i will always get a case for a macbook from now on 
05:15  pgpkeys: i do photoshop as well. other than a bit of delay when stuff loads its not bad
05:15  seltz: wow, i use a thinkpad 2.4ghz 8gb ram, invested only about 700 bucks in it so far
05:15  EM03: i guess you can expect a little damage here and there you are using it heh
05:15  LSD`: pgpkeys: I bought mine knowing full-well it only had a GMA950. It was eitehr that, or spend 2000+ on a PC notebook with a weaker CPU, just as useless 7300 graphics and Vista, or spend a thousand bucks extra going to a 15" Pro with nothing of any particular benefit
05:15 --- mikeplus32 is now known as mikeplus64
05:15  jeffszusz: i love my mac but I don't think i'll be buying macs for work purposes any longer
05:16  seltz: one of the last ones with 1600x1080 screens though, so i may get a macbook pro next just because i love this screen setup
05:16  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: i'm actually highly considering giving up the amd64 PC laptop|desktop stuff just for macs even for work (I run my own SOHO)
05:16  jeffszusz: I'll likely buy a mac for home/family use and have a linux pc for my development work in future. The OSX unix environment annoys me.
05:17  LSD`: I actually feel the opposite, tbh. Linux annoys me infinitely more than OS X. It's why I investigated getting a Mac in the first place.
05:17  pgpkeys: i just wish they offered quad core i7 macbook pro series :) 
05:17  pgpkeys: rather than just the dual core
05:17  jeffszusz: ah well, for "business" purposes I would prefer a mac, yes
05:17  LSD`: meh, the dual cores are better unless you routinely use all four cores
05:17  jeffszusz: it's just that trying to develop software in the unix environment on a mac is not that fun
05:17  seltz: pgpkeys: fav. computer with a quad core so far has been the hp envy 14
05:18  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: i've had no probs. i came from linux. only reason I ran windows at all was for games.
05:18  pgpkeys: then again I've been a linux user ince 94
05:18  jeffszusz: that's good
05:18  pgpkeys: gave up windows as my base OS almost 3 years ago. 
05:19  LSD`: The Clarksfield mobile quad i7s have stupidly low base clock speeds so you're either turbo'ing them up to something useful, at which point you'd have been better off buying a dual core Arrandale, or running stuff that makes enough use of the two extra cores the low clock speed doesn't hurt
05:19  seltz: jeffszusz: yeah, i've thought about switching to linux full-time, colinux support under win7 64 (what i use now) is non-existent
05:19  pgpkeys: (hehe got tired of running linux in a VM only to spend 99% of my time there)
05:19  pgpkeys: LSD`: yeah there's always a tradeoff somewhere 
05:19  jeffszusz: I love my mac. I just can't stand how stubborn it is when it comes to letting me do what I want in unix.
05:20  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: can i inquire as to what?
05:20  LSD`: jeffszusz: I love my Mac because I don't have to do the kinds of things "in unix" that Linux users accept as facts of life, but shouldn;t happen on anything claiming to be a desktop OS
05:20  pgpkeys: once i installed macports, the software lack was gone.
05:21  jeffszusz: macports could probably solve most of my issues, i admit
05:21  pgpkeys: LSD`: ahh well most linux distributions (bearing in mind linux is just a kernel coupled with GNU software) don't claim to be for desktops specifically.
05:21  pgpkeys: they do claim configurations AIMED at the desktop OR server
05:21  pgpkeys: i know its semantics but in this case it counts
05:22  jeffszusz: I don't like that many packages, rsync of example, are so out of date that you can't just deal with it, you -have- to update
05:22  jeffszusz: but in order to update you have to compile from source and crap
05:22  jeffszusz: i just want to apt-get my way to happiness.
05:22  pgpkeys: jeffszusz: the other one i've heard of but not tried is fink. i've used macports and homebrew and there are FAR more ports available in macports than homebrew
05:22  LSD`: pgpkeys: Well, they should either make more of an effort to create as seamles (as in, no CLI BS unless hte user chooses to use it) a desktop environment as possible, or admit that Windows and Linux do that job better and stay on servers
05:22  pgpkeys: figured macports to be the better choice
05:22  seltz: i heard fink is nearly dead
05:23  pgpkeys: LSD`: yeah thats a prevalent argument i've been seeing more and more
05:23  seltz: it was the old-school way to do it
05:23  LSD`: pgpkeys: Mac OS X has had it mostly sorted since 2003-2004, but Linux is still struggling 6-7 years later
05:23  EM03: any of you have a paranoid personality?
05:23  LSD`: EM03: I would afer I'd just dropped my 1500-2000 laptop XD
05:23  pgpkeys: LSD`: hehe it will. its never been a commercial venture
05:23  pgpkeys: EM03: well my nick shows I tend to have a fairly strong paranoia streak ;)
05:24  EM03: im thinking now that im seeing a sorta reddish tint in my application menu bars 
05:24  EM03: but im not 
05:24  LSD`: pgpkeys: People have been saying that it will for over a decade, but so far it keeps missing the mark
05:24  EM03: atleast i dont think so lol 
05:24  pgpkeys: also, guys, I'm moving from efnet to freenode. so if i seem 'rough', just give me a bit. freenode is less Hold What You Got than efnet. takes a shift in mindframe
05:24  LSD`: pgpkeys: The problem is they keep letting GPL and free software politics get in the way of delivering a decent user experience
05:24  pgpkeys: LSD`: its trying
05:25  pgpkeys: LSD`: yeah thats a big problem for which i blame stallman
05:25  pgpkeys: he did a good thing and then went WAY WAY overboard with it
05:25  pgpkeys: and thats pretty much dictated the pulse of the last generation of linux devs and users
05:25  EM03: LSD`: can you just say , your macbook is fine nothing to worry about 
05:26  LSD`: pgpkeys: It's not just his fault, almost eeryone in any kind of development or decision making capacity on a Linux distribution thinks in a similar way, which is why even the distros claiming to be working for the desktop aren't making the kind of headway they should be
05:26  pgpkeys: LSD`: i used to be a package maintainer for Debian GNU/Linux. I left the project for exactly the reason you speak 
05:26  pgpkeys: err of
05:27  pgpkeys: LSD`: oh no doubt. i'm not putting *all* the blame on him. just saying he did a *lot* to hamper the needed change in mindframe
05:28  pgpkeys: but i also notice an almost extreme mindframe of holierthanthough with a lot of the devs in lead positions and decision makers too which negatively impacts linux's growth as a community worldwide, and as individual distros
05:28  pgpkeys: to the point of directly attacking *other* distros doing fairly much the same thing they are
05:28  pgpkeys: its gotten.. nasty i guess is the right word
05:29  pgpkeys: brb i need a cig

07:28  pgpkeys: hehe
07:28  cryptics_: jedivulcan: the way i had it setup replayed buffers on every client that connected
07:28  cryptics_: which caused problems on an older powerbook G4 :)
07:29  jedivulcan: Yeah, it's a bit of a sudden load. It'd be nice if clients connected a bit more sequentially.
07:29  cryptics_: i just turned logging on with the extras, no buffers so i can just grep the logs if need be
07:30  jedivulcan: For some reason, if there's already a client connected, it won't buffer for other devices that connect along with the first device.
07:31  jedivulcan: No replays are like flying blind -_-'

12:40  pgpkeys: when you've dont all that then when you go back under the preferences and select advanced again, you should see Bluetooth-PDA-Sync of type modem listed in the device area down the bottom
12:41  pgpkeys: make sure you have it checkmarked for On. *I* personally also ensure that pairing is enabled so I can see if anyone is trying to access without permission and then I can enforce access restrictions
12:41  pgpkeys: thats th elittle key thing right next to the On
12:42  pgpkeys: and i make sure Require Pairing is enabled under Bluetooth Sharing options as well

15:56  commander-ape: 371647 0 drwx------@ 28 myusername  staff   952 13 Jan 14:55 myusername
15:56  commander-ape: does this look right to you?
16:08  pgpkeys: perms should be drwxr-xr-x+
16:09  pgpkeys: aka chmod 755 ~
16:09 +ChrisAM: 700 is correct for User directories in /Users.
16:10  pgpkeys: 255070 0 drwxr-xr-x+ 38 pgpkeys  staff  1292 17 Jan 10:05 pgpkeys/
16:10  pgpkeys: those are the default permissions OS X gives 
16:10 +ChrisAM: You like having other system users being able to see the files in your home directory?
16:10  pgpkeys: well then complain to Apple
16:11  pgpkeys: those are the default permissions that apple has OS X make user dirs as
16:11  pgpkeys: gives me a default place to start troubleshooting
16:11  pgpkeys: err him
16:11  commander-ape: okay - i did a chmod 755 myuserdirectory and i stell get a permssion denied when i try to create a folder
16:11  Tomis2: for my home folder i see... (me) R&W, staff Read Only, everyone Read Only
16:11  pgpkeys: do  whoami
16:12  pgpkeys: errr?
16:12  commander-ape: gives me the same user as in ls -lisa under /Users
16:12  pgpkeys: 644 on your homedir?
16:12  pgpkeys: cause that's what that is rw-r--r-- is
16:12  Tomis2: did you try just repairing permissions commander-ape ?
16:12 +ChrisAM: ah... I see... it goes to 700 when you turn on FileVault.
16:13  pgpkeys: ahh yeah due to the encryption
16:13  commander-ape: okay now my dir looks right
16:13  commander-ape: 371647 0 drwxr-xr-x@ 28 myuser  staff   952 13 Jan 14:55 myuserdir
16:13  commander-ape: strangly i didnt repair any permissions
16:13  pgpkeys: err @?
16:13  pgpkeys: usually means its a symlink
16:13 +ChrisAM: commander-ape ... do you have FileVault turned on?
16:13  commander-ape: no filevault
16:13  commander-ape: im confused by the @ too
16:14  pgpkeys: ls -ald ~
16:14  pgpkeys: should be drwxr-xr-x+
16:14  pgpkeys: without filevault that is
16:14  commander-ape: drwxr-xr-x@ 28 myuser  staff  952 13 Jan 14:55 /Users/myuser
16:15 +ChrisAM: The @ indicates extended attributes
16:15  pgpkeys: ok different from linux then in that regard. my bad 
16:15 +ChrisAM: do an ls -la@
16:15 +ChrisAM: there's no lsattr command in os x

16:17  pgpkeys: does whoami thats correct
16:17  pgpkeys: err
16:17  commander-ape: yeah - whoami gets me the same user as the directory owner
16:17 +ChrisAM: There shouldn't be any extended attributes set on your home directory... that may be messing you up
16:17  pgpkeys: 1) does whoami match the directory owner 2) thats the correct set of perms on ?users
16:17  pgpkeys: damn it
16:17 +ChrisAM: can you pastebin the output of that?

16:20  EM03: more specifically led backlit ones
16:20 +ChrisAM: EM03 ... I've got an older one (2006).. mine's up all the way
16:20  EM03: i got a 2010, i bet my half brightness if close to your full
16:20  commander-ape: here is from my /User
16:20  commander-ape: http://pastebin.com/qJDnJf9H
16:21 +ChrisAM: I've got a 27" iMac... I run it at 50% or less brightness
16:21  EM03: yea
16:21  EM03: the led backlit stuff is almost blinding at full brightness
16:21  EM03: i find a bit darker to be more comfortable these days with long use 
16:21  commander-ape: i can try to repair permissions with the apple HD tool
16:22 +ChrisAM: commander-ape ... weird... those don't look like they'd cause problems.
16:22 +ChrisAM: commander-ape ... with disk utility?
16:22  commander-ape: yepp
16:22 +ChrisAM: that's worth a shot
16:23  EM03: i bet some people run there stuff at 100 percent brightness even on led 
16:23  EM03: only time i do that is when i want to show clients stuff ....brighter == better
16:23  commander-ape: strange thing is I can create folders and files in subfolders for example is /Users/myuser/Sites
16:23  pgpkeys: i run mine 2 notches down from maximum
16:23  EM03: led?
16:23  commander-ape: and this has excactly the same owner and everything
16:24  pgpkeys: no
16:24  EM03: the led max is super bright 
16:24  pgpkeys: just regular laptop screen is run 2 notches down from max
16:24  pgpkeys: ah
16:24  EM03: even 2 notches down on the led is probably higher than max 
16:24  EM03: on the old macbooks 
16:24  pgpkeys: heh
16:25  EM03: i fun mine at about 40 percent brightness 
16:25  EM03: run*
16:25  pgpkeys: i run my non led at full brightness when i'm sitting in the dark. otherwise i turn it down
16:25  EM03: huh?
16:26  EM03: its supposed to be opporsite of that
16:26  EM03: when in dark i turn mine to about 30 percent
16:26  EM03: sometimes 10-20
16:26  EM03: not good for your eyes to do that 
16:26  pgpkeys: nope. otherwise its difficult to see the keys. and when i'm tired i make a lot of typos so its easier to see the etchings on the keys
16:26  EM03: i touch type 
16:27  pgpkeys: so do i but when you're tired and forget which key is which
16:27  EM03: huh?
16:27  pgpkeys: sigh nevermind
16:27  EM03: if you type touch you dont need that trust me 
16:27  EM03: :) 
16:27  pgpkeys: ok if you say so
16:27  EM03: the f and the j is the only thing i need 
16:28  EM03: everyone says they touch type but no one wants to put the effort in to learn it correctly 
16:28  pgpkeys: anyways, time to make a trip to the store and then off to bed
16:29  pgpkeys: well considering i took a couple keyboarding classes when i was in college i learned how they taught me. its worked for over 20 years for me
16:30  pgpkeys: but anyways.. later
16:30  EM03: its almost a disrespect to say you need to look at the keyboard :) I program and use things like {} and [] and ' ' ' ' and never look 
16:30  pgpkeys: i'm a programmer myelf
16:31  pgpkeys: and i constantly make mistakes or have that odd moment of being unsure or make a stab at a key and hit the wrong one
16:31  EM03: what language?
16:31  pgpkeys: called human nature. and human nature is to make mistakes
16:31  pgpkeys: ruby, rails, C, and C++
16:31  pgpkeys: lil bit of shell scripting as well
16:31  EM03: there is a reason why there is a f and a j 
16:31  pgpkeys: ya think?
16:31  EM03: but yea full brightness dark room holy crap

16:32  pgpkeys: wow. so glad you're perfect at typing. us lowly humans make mistakes
16:32  EM03: i was just kidding more or less pgpkeys but i do play mavis beacon typing once a week for 2 hours 
16:34  pgpkeys: i'm touchy. super tired and not relishing walking in 14F to the store
16:34  pgpkeys: ignore me until i've had sleep. wont be so snarky then
16:34  pgpkeys: which i will do now like i've said i would to myself about 20 times

18:57  Al2O3: Now that the Steve has gone in for another liver, its time to just enjoy the invasiveness of the OSX experience as it is.  I'm sure he'll dream up something better down the road that will piss off a LOT more people...  So just hold on.
18:57  Al2O3: Oh, definitely save your money.
18:57  Al2O3: Total waste of time and money on iDeath 20xx
19:18  S_SubZero: if your current software is performing to your expectations, you could review the new software (use google) and see if it offers features you can justify paying for.
19:26  Wizard: hi
19:27  Wizard: does system update backup old files?
19:27  Wizard: i'm cleaning the disk and i'm wondering…
19:44  Fedayk1n: Wizard: I think it does, but scrubs them during one of the maintenance scripts
19:45  Wizard: ah, ok
19:45  Wizard: so, i need to tell my leopard, that it is not updated ;P
19:46  Wizard: so software update would react as it clean install
19:46  Wizard: is that possible?
19:46  Wizard: "forgetting" and update in pkgutil didn't help
19:46  Fedayk1n: you can re-download the update from apple I believe
19:47  Wizard: hmm
19:47  Wizard: good idea
19:47  Wizard: first i'm gonna look for some software updates files
19:47  Wizard: damn, damn…
19:48  Wizard: i was removing Qt-sdk yesterday and accidentally removed QTKit
19:48  Fedayk1n: qt as in quicktime,  or qt the runtime?
19:49  Wizard: dunno what this apple framework actually does
19:49  Wizard: Mail and Podgląd stopped working
19:50  Wizard: dyld: Library not loaded: /System/Library/Frameworks/QTKit.framework/Versions/A/QTKit
19:50  Wizard: good that i didn't reboot
19:51  Wizard: restoring ubuntu is a little bit easier ;P
19:56  luist: whats the core i7 that comes in macbook pro?
19:58  Fedayk1n: wizard you running 10.6.6?
19:58  S_SubZero: i7-620m I think
19:59  barglfargl: I'm looking at my old eMac's specs, it apparently uses an Ultra/ATA 100 HDD
19:59  Wizard: Fedayk1n: no, latest leopard
20:00  Fedayk1n: oh
20:00  Fedayk1n: hmmm
20:00  barglfargl: can I replace it with any other old Ultra/ATA 100 HDD, or is there something special that I need to know about?
20:00  Fedayk1n: I was gonna offer to zipup qtkit.framework
20:00  Fedayk1n: but i'm on 10.6.6
20:00  Wizard: Fedayk1n: ppc
20:00  Fedayk1n: might not do ya any good
20:00  Tomis: there are maximum supported storage sizes on some of those older PPC machines
20:00  Tomis: i'd check everymac.com and see if there's any notes about it
20:01  Wizard: Fedayk1n: i've installed package with this library from install dvd
20:02  barglfargl: Tomis: I'm pretty sure this other hdd I have is of less capacity
20:02  barglfargl: thanks though, I'll take a look
20:05  Wizard: rotfl
20:05  Wizard: i've just watched a tv ad with Garri Kasparov
20:05  Wizard: :D
20:06  luist: S_SubZero: so it has only 2 cores?
20:06  S_SubZero: it has two cores.
20:07  Al2O3: this one was good...  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6926742237079377874#
20:08  Al2O3: GK sitting down with a fat kid being stumped by Alta Vista (are they even in business still?)
20:08  Al2O3: © 2011 Overture Services, Inc.  :)
20:10  jiggliemon_: Testing
20:11  Al2O3: 1, 2, 3
20:13  Al2O3: Good doc on GK  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4728324145911578749#
20:15  simplicity-: Who is Garry Kasparov?
20:20  MrUnagi: engadget has a good article on 1g 2g 3g and 4g.....the 4g branding is quite annoying
20:21  Wizard: Fedayk1n: i've found update combo on apple.com, thanks for advice ;>
20:22 +LaraX: simplicity-: a chess player
20:22  simplicity-: Ah, sounds boring. :P
20:22  Tomis: it's more like 3.5g, but they call it 4g because americans can't comprehend fractions
20:23  Tomis: hence why pricing is always $x.95
20:23  Fedayk1n: Wizard: hopefully it'll work for ya
20:23  MrUnagi: lol Tomis 
20:23  Tomis: people ignore anything after the decimal point
20:23  MrUnagi: or 3.03 9/10 for a gallon of gas
20:23  MrUnagi: just say 3.04!!!
20:24  Tomis: but then they'd be rounding up and overcharging you
20:25  MrUnagi: lol

21:34  MrPockets: Angostura, I'm trying to export from the Mac Mail
21:34  MrPockets: not import to
21:34  Angostura: Export the .mbox from Mail
21:35  Angostura: Import to Outlook
21:37  MrPockets: Thats what i've been trying
21:37  MrPockets: but it seems as though mBox is a pain to import if you don't have OE
21:40  Angostura: You are  trying to import into Outlook 2011 on the Mac, yes?
21:40  MrPockets: no. I am trying to export mail, from Mac mail on a mac,  and import it into Outlook 2003 in a XP Pro sp3 machine
21:41  MrPockets: or, in my lab here, i'm using outlook 2010, but the end result needs to get mac mail into outlook 2k3 
21:41  Angostura: That would have been useful information in a Mac channel

21:43 +crilly: Can anyone suggest a version control system that I could use with Dropbox? A friend of mine gives me artwork to do from time to time, and she often losses track of what has changed; I've suggested version control to manage this, but I've gone a bit over my head really because I'm not all that familiar with it.
21:43  MrPockets: Angostura, yeah, sorry. I'm a Windows domain admin, dont' have much Mac experience. When i said Outlook I assumed everyone would think outlook-PC
21:44  Angostura: MrPockets: Just having a search about now for you
21:44  Angostura: (didn't mean to be arsey)
21:44  Angostura: crilly: Why not use the Packrat option on Dropbox
21:44  MrPockets: Thanks man. i've been googeling the bejeezus out of the issue for a while, so don't sweat it too much. Just didn't know if there was an obvious face-palm'er that i've been overlooking
21:44  Angostura: Saves all changes for ever
21:44 +crilly: Angostura: Never heard of it... go on, tell me about it and rock my world
21:45  Angostura: crilly: Consider your world rocked https://www.dropbox.com/help/113
21:46 +crilly: Ah, need a pro acccount
21:49  MrPockets: K i got it
21:50  MrPockets: gmail has a Mail uploader for Mac.  I should be able to upload it to a new gmail account, then pull it down from that Gmail account on the PC, and from there just drag it into the main PST
21:50 * MrPockets bangs head on desk
21:50  MrPockets: this is going to blow when we do the exchange install
21:50  Angostura: Yeh. There are these guys too 
21:50  Angostura: http://www.outlookimport.com/?s=.mbox
21:51  Angostura: Never tried them though
21:51  MrPockets: yeah, I tried that this morning, but the demo will only move 50 messages, or 5 per folder
21:51  Angostura: MrPockets: Why not just install Outlook 2011 on the Mac and stay in the happy Jobsian paradise we all know and love
21:52  MrPockets: lol
21:52  MrPockets: A) we don't have  mac office licensing, and it'd be suicide to to present that quote to the client
21:52  MrPockets: B) i'm not really a mac hater, but windows works so much better in a windows domain than OSX
21:53  Angostura: Fairynuff. You might persuade the client to cough up for a proper outlookimport license, though
21:53  MrPockets: yeah, that's tottally an option
21:53  Angostura: $25?
21:53  MrPockets: "its your own damn fait for using Macs"   :-p

22:21  brontoeee: Angostura, it gives me the *.exe without asking ...
22:21 +FriedBob: Mornin'
22:22  Tasser: any reason why mac hangs accessing a webdav on a lighttpd?
22:22 +FriedBob: I'm sure there are plenty
22:23  brontoeee: can somebody check whats the latest version for mac, is it 5.0.3 ?
22:23  Angostura: brontoeee: http://www.apple.com/safari/download/ should give you the choice
22:24  Angostura: brontoeee: Yup
22:24  Tasser: FriedBob, easiest way to get a fileserver of any kind running on the mac?
22:24 +FriedBob: Tasser: Is it only your mac that hangs, or do other systems as well?
22:24  brontoeee: Angostura, no choice, always seems to think iam on windows, which iam not and even then silly assumptions ...
22:24 +FriedBob: Samba/SMB ? I don't know. And my mac is old enough that I can't really use it to help you
22:24  Angostura: brontoeee: What OS are you on?
22:24  brontoeee: Angostura, ubuntu
22:25  Angostura: No idea then
22:25  torchie: I am running risc OS right now, I would like to download the latest itunes
22:25  torchie: brontoeee: spoof your user agent
22:25  Tasser: FriedBob, mac only
22:25  brontoeee: torchie, ah good idea, like firefox running on osx should do?
22:25 +FriedBob: Tasser: My mac is PPC
22:25  Angostura: Tasser: Are you trying to connect to a file server, or serve files?
22:26  Tasser: Angostura, push some files to the linux machine
22:26  Tasser: Angostura, or pull them from the mac machine, doesn't really matter
22:27  Angostura: System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing > Options
22:27  brontoeee: Tasser, there is gazzilion ways, usually linuxes are running some sort of ftp or ssh, then you just need a client on mac side, like filezilla
22:27  Angostura: Lets you select FTP, SMB or AppleShare
22:28  brontoeee: my linux is currently pushing safari5 to my mac via blutooth
22:28  Tasser: brontoeee, oh, ssh. right. thanks ;-)
22:29  BobbyJr: torchie: Did I read that right, you're on RISC OS right now?
22:29  brontoeee: Tasser, on ubuntu or derivates ssh server is usually just 'apt-get install ssh' and then connect with your usual user/pass
22:30  torchie: yes I bought myself a brand new acorn computer with the most fantastic specifications
22:30  torchie: I hope to run crysis as well as encode 1080p video for blu ray recording
22:31  Tasser: brontoeee, yeah, I know my linux ;-)
22:31  Fedayk1n: acorn is back?
22:33  BobbyJr: torchie: I havent met anyone that has a risc os based machine for almost a decade lol. Im impressed. I still have my old Acorn Risc PC 600 around here somewhere.
22:33  torchie: aww man now I don't want to let you down
22:33  torchie: I'm not really on a risc os machine
22:33  torchie: it'd be cool to have one for the heck of it though
22:34  BobbyJr: lol damn, guess I am the only one left on the planet then haha
22:34  BobbyJr: Ive read there is a risc os open project ongoing to port it to modern arm hardware.
22:57  emperium: Hello 
22:57  nat2610_: is there a good method to mount  a dmg in a different location than /Volumes ? 
22:57  emperium: anyone uses Reeder ?
23:09  Mikael: Has anybody had any luck using UAZoomChangeFocus() to emulate Ctrl-Scroll on Snow Leopard? The only thing I can find on it is a single call somewhere in WebKit, and a forum thread complaining it fails with a successful error code (which is my problem as well).
23:10  Angostura: Try #macosxdev?
23:14  Mikael: ah yes, of course; my baapologies
23:15  Angostura: not a problem, just a suggestion
