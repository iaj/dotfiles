00:57  alexlea: i need to get a faster drive
00:57  LordDragon: but
00:57  LordDragon: its not for the OS
00:57  LordDragon: its for my media storage
00:57  alexlea: "the blacks"?
00:57  LordDragon: i dont need high speed
00:57  alexlea: i've been sick for the past 2 days :(
00:57  LordDragon: alexlea, yes. its not as racist as it sounds :P western digital has their line of "green" drives. they are more energy efficient and run cooler but at the expense of some performance
00:58  LordDragon: alexlea, then there is the "black" line of drives. they are geared for better performance
00:58  alexlea: ok
00:58  LordDragon: so now i have 4 hds in my mac pro
00:59 --- memenode is now known as memecake
00:59  LordDragon: 1TB black for the OS, 2TB green, 1TB black for extra storage, and an old 500gb

01:05  LordDragon: ahhh
01:05  LordDragon: i hope it works out :)
01:05  alexlea: thanks
01:05  alexlea: phoenix is so cheap..
01:06  alexlea: this apartment is like super nice, and is less than 500 bux...in LA it would cost over 1200
01:06  alexlea: LA was the problem
01:06  alexlea: i miss the ocean though
01:07  LordDragon: woah
01:07  LordDragon: 500 bucks?
01:07  LordDragon: that is damn cheap
01:07  LordDragon: here its around 1k for a crappy apartment
01:07  alexlea: yeah, and it's a 2 bedroom, plus is HUGE.... its bigger than a 2 bedroom hoisue i had in cali
01:08  alexlea: house*
01:08  alexlea: new england is expesnive like cali
01:08  LordDragon: yeah :(
01:08  alexlea: cause thats how cali is, 1000 for a apt in the ghetto
01:08  alexlea: brb
01:10  MikeFreeman: I cannot see to create any executables
01:10  MikeFreeman: seem*
01:11  MikeFreeman: I was trying to innstall git from source, and I got an error on the ./configure with the error of configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
01:11  MikeFreeman: See `config.log' for more details
01:12  MikeFreeman: and then i tried sudo port -d selfupdate so i can use port
01:12  MikeFreeman: and then i got the same error
01:12  LordDragon: MikeFreeman, sounds like the channel you want is #macdev
01:12  LordDragon:  <MikeFreeman> I was trying to innstall git from source
01:13  MikeFreeman: Why would I want mac dev?
01:13  LordDragon: id say thats your problem :P
01:13  LordDragon: cuz its development related question
01:13  MikeFreeman: It is not, I think, since my problem is that I cannot create executables
01:13  MikeFreeman: not installing git
01:13  LordDragon: here we download the .dmg and drag the app to our applications folder :)
01:13  MikeFreeman: ah
01:13  MikeFreeman: thanks, I'll head on over to Tier Two support ;)
01:13  LordDragon: but in #macdev, they know all about that weird source code stuff
01:14  alexlea: i used an installer for git
01:15  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah as do most of us. he seems to want to build it all from scratch 
01:16  alexlea: phoenix is not like i expected...they actually have winter here
01:16  alexlea: no snow or anything, but gloomy and cold most days
01:17  LordDragon: MikeFreeman, it sounds like a problem with xcode. u sure you installed it?
01:17  LordDragon: alexlea, yeah its been cold here too. below freezing at the moment. 30F
01:17  Swian: cold here, but windows are open
01:17  Swian: FL doesn't get that cold
01:17  alexlea: i thiink its 50-something here....
01:19  alexlea: Swian: what part of fl
01:20  Swian: near orlando
01:22  alexlea: i couldnt live near orlando...if i was gonna live in fl i would have to be by the ocean
01:22  alexlea: florida has way nicer beaches than cali....

13:05  farmcretin: HELP REQUEST: intermittent kernal panics during finals week. tested RAM and HDD, no errors. cant reinstall OS X until discs in hand (3 weeks), cant take to apple store until after finals (2weeks) SOLUTION: ubuntu LIVE usb. QUESTION:why does my live usb boot on PC, but not macbook pro?
13:06  alexlea: cause macs dont like booting legacy os-es from external media
13:06  farmcretin: ubuntu counts as legacy? what can i boot from external media?
13:07  farmcretin: isnt that why theres the "E" boot option?
13:07  alexlea: you can boot it from a cd
13:07  alexlea: just not from usb, or external hard drives, etc
13:08  farmcretin: thats odd, but if thats the case... you know for sure? i was hoping to make it a persistant ubuntu, so i could keep my settings and stuff
13:08  KsM: I think you'd need to "bless" a drive before booting form it
13:08  KsM: I heard that somewhere before
13:09  alexlea: KsM: it doesnt apply to this
13:09  KsM: Okay then,, forget what I was saying
13:09  alexlea: farmcretin: *some*usb's will boot, but there is no standard rule of which ones will work....and i am only even mentioning it cause a reliable person from another channel said some will work..but most wont (when dealing with non osx os-es)
13:10  KsM: Bah, the comma key on this iBook is super sensitive
13:10  farmcretin: so its dependent on usb hardware? 
13:10  alexlea: farmcretin: that is what i have been told. from personal expereince i have tried at least 10 usb devices and none would work
13:11  farmcretin: alexlea: ok, but CDs work?
13:11  alexlea: cd's do indeed work, yes
13:11  farmcretin: thanks
13:16  alexlea: yw

17:22  MrSin: Yeah, sometimes it's like that :).
17:23  MrSin: ^-^
17:23  KsM: I have a 5 page essay to write
17:23  MrSin: Topic?
17:23  KsM: About any physicist
17:24  MrSin: Theoretical?
17:24  MrSin: Einstein or Hawking
17:24  KsM: Basically just write a bio on them
17:24  KsM: and I don't think anyone chose Einstein 
17:24  KsM: So I picked him
17:24  MrSin: That should be easy, he was brilliant!
17:25  KsM: I'm starting page 3 now, so far a bit over 1,000 words
17:25  KsM: Wonder how my teacher is even going to find time to check all of these
17:26  KsM: I'm not one that tends to write long stories/essays
17:26  KsM: I'll get mixed up in them
17:26  KsM: I try to keep it more simple
17:26  MrSin: Sounds like you're almost half way there.
17:26  MrSin: When is it due?
17:26  crilly: They don't check them all. They spot check random essays.
17:27  KsM: Tomorrow
17:27  KsM: the 2 pages was what I di all of yesterday
17:27  MrSin: Whoa. You just need to focus.
17:27  fujisan: KsM:  he will read the first and last sentence of each page
17:28  KsM: between fixing up the iBook/laundry/visiting my great grandmother/ being annoyed by my drunk dad
17:28  fujisan: KsM:  rewind fixing up the iBook?
17:28  KsM: iBook g3
17:28  fujisan: logic board, battery?
17:28  KsM: Neither
17:28  fujisan: vexations :o

17:28  fujisan: oh ok
17:29  fujisan: you run tiger on it or jaguar?
17:29  fujisan: or os9
17:29  KsM: tiger
17:29  fujisan: cool
17:30  MrSin: Running Leopard on my iBook G4 and Snow Leopard on my iMac.
17:30  fujisan: i only have tiger in vmware :O
17:30  fujisan: lol you have them all
17:30  fujisan: ibook G4 is nice for tiger ?
17:31  MrSin: Yes, it had Tiger on it when I bought it (05) but has Leopard on it now.
17:31  fujisan: do you know if leopard will run on new iMacs?
17:31  fujisan: i have snow leopard on it
17:31  fujisan: was just wondering
17:32  KsM: I wish Apple would bring back the iBook design
17:32  fujisan: you mean the flashy colours?
17:32  KsM: The case
17:32  fujisan: the neon stuff
17:33  KsM: I liked the keyboard, the trackpad,, and the little light and clip
17:33  fujisan: yeah
17:33  KsM: Now the trackpad on the macbook feels funny, and the button is relatively small
17:33  KsM: the keyboard is all spaced out, and gets dirty quick
17:33  KsM: and can't be taken off
17:34  fujisan: yeah thats the downside
17:34  KsM: the little light that shows on sleep is now in the far right, and really tiny and odd-looking

17:35  fujisan: made a bid on one for 300 euros
17:37  matthias-: Hey guys
17:37  matthias-: i got an external hdd today
17:37  fujisan: congrats
17:37  fujisan: matsebc: 
17:37  fujisan: matthias-: 
17:37  matthias-: WD one, and it sayd the speeds are 480Mbps
17:37  matthias-: fujisan: long time no see.
17:37  fujisan: hehe
17:37  matthias-: the disc is in Windows NT Filesystem (Tuxera NTFS)
17:37  matthias-: should i re-format it to get better speeds or what?
17:38  fujisan: hmz i partitioned mine
17:38  matthias-: what i'd like to do is to partition it 
17:38  fujisan: i reduced the ntfs size to 50 gb for my bootcamp windows :O
17:38  matthias-: 400GB with mac FS, and 100 for windows
17:38  matthias-: yeah
17:38  matthias-: fujisan: exactly what i want to do
17:38  fujisan: and the rest i made hfs os x drive and a partition for timemachine
17:38  matthias-: fujisan: will changing the FS increase speeds thou?
17:39  matthias-: fujisan: so should i partition it with disc utility?
17:39  fujisan: i dunno but i do know that a few days a go whenever i tried to empty the trashcan i got a kernel panic from trying to remove files from the ntfs partition via trashcan so i made sure i hadnt have to deal with ntfs on os x again
17:40  fujisan: matthias-: i used ipartition for it, but i guess you could use disk utility as well
17:40  matthias-: and what fs?
17:40  matthias-: the MOS Extended journaled?
17:40  fujisan: yes
17:41  matthias-: yeah I don't think i'll be using time machine anyway
17:41  fujisan: oh i gave timemachine about 250 gb
17:41  fujisan: i keep my os installs small
17:41  matthias-: yeah i dont need that one
17:42  matthias-: Partition failed with the error:
17:42  matthias-: File system formatter failed
17:42  fujisan: and i left about 200 gb unpartitioned 
17:42  fujisan: so i always have free space to move files around 
17:42  matthias-: mhm
17:43  fujisan: ipartition never failed for me
17:43  matthias-: disk utility seems not to be happy with me formatting something to ntfs
17:43  matthias-: ;]
17:43  fujisan: disk utitlity seems a bit too technical
17:43  fujisan: ipartition simplicity and works flawless only it's not free :O
17:44  matthias-: fujisan: I will be trying to install windows 7 on that external HDD :D
17:44  fujisan: cool
17:44  matthias-: fujisan: what do you use to copy files?
17:44  fujisan: what do you mean?
17:44  matthias-: as in, is there a faster way than drag and drop?
17:45  matthias-: now it's ~10MB/s
17:45  matthias-: i'd expect about 30
17:45  fujisan: i moved 240 gb of files from my old corrupted ntfs partition to the mos extended journal one
17:45  fujisan: it took me a few hours
17:45  fujisan: was fast enough
17:46  fujisan: considering the amount of files i had to move
17:46  matthias-: ;]
17:46  matthias-: yeah ive got about 500GB
17:46  fujisan: i got a 1tb samsung

17:46  matthias-: 2x500gb
17:46  matthias-: didnt want a TB one
17:46  matthias-: rather split the data
17:46  outcast: in pages to a existing text
17:46  matthias-: in case one hdd fails
17:46  fujisan: matthias-: your drive must me faster than mine
17:47  matthias-: 50gb in 20minutes
17:47  fujisan: in case mine fails i'll get a new one
17:47  matthias-: not that fast.
17:47  fujisan: i maybe get another one btw
17:47  matthias-: fujisan: yeah, but i dont want to loose the data ;D
17:47  fujisan: only like 80euros for 1 tb

17:57 * MrSin *
17:57  matthias-: yeah
17:57  matthias-: i like the portable ones 
17:57  matthias-: ;]
17:58  fujisan: matthias-: i backup my partition with dvds :o 
17:58  fujisan: and then index those dvds with a catalogue app
17:58  fujisan: so when the drive fails i still have the data
17:58  matthias-: yeah i rather have a few drives
17:58  matthias-: than dvd's ;d
17:58  matthias-: its too slow
17:58  matthias-: ;d
17:58  fujisan: yes but
17:59  crilly: NAS.
17:59  fujisan: i spread the risk so thin
17:59  fujisan: those dvds will outlast your drives
18:00  matthias-: fujisan: they may
18:00  fujisan: you will be always buying new externals to backup your older ones
18:00  fujisan: :D
18:00  fujisan: no not may
18:00  imacake: all the guys in #windows are some kind of total newbs. halding newb problems xd
18:00  fujisan: i have dvds over 10 years old
18:00  matthias-: but i don't need backups over 2 years old
18:00  matthias-: you better tell my why my drive is so slow
18:01  fujisan: lol
18:01  matthias-: it should be 6-70MB/s
18:01  matthias-: 60-70
18:01  fujisan: samsung is betta :D
18:01  imacake: wow
18:01  imacake: i have 14MB/s
18:01  imacake: but wait. XFS is RAPID
18:01  imacake: then i get like 30MB/s
18:02  matthias-: still, new hdd
18:02  matthias-: sdd -> hdd
18:02  matthias-: should be topping it
18:02  Marctraider: imacake :)
18:03  imacake: eh, hi
18:03  Marctraider: hoi
18:03  fujisan: matthias-: what happened to google wave?
18:04  imacake: downloading ubuntu 11.04 alpha :D As in videos its got an awesome unity interface
18:04  matthias-: fujisan: died
18:04  matthias-: ;]
18:04  fujisan: but the site is still up :)
18:04  matthias-: fujisan: can i partition existing partition without loosing the data
18:04  imacake: matthias-, yes
18:04  fujisan: i am not sure depends
18:04  matthias-: by ipartition?
18:04  fujisan: i havent tried it
18:05  imacake: with gparted you can easily resize any partition (except XFS) without data loss
18:05  mrapple: beta testers are welcome -> http://s.bzextreme.com/

18:05  imacake: linux ?
18:05  mrapple: lil applet that appears on your desktop, or upload via web interface
18:06  matthias-: imacake: and xfs is ?
18:06  imacake: XFS is a FS format designed for high speed
18:06  imacake: but to keep it high speed, its unable to shirk it
18:07  imacake: but its possible to extend it even while in use
18:07  avalon: Hello people!
18:08  avalon: I am trying to move my old Mail account from one machine to other. I tryed to move the user/Library/Mail folder to the new one but it doesn't seens to be working. Could someone help me on that please?
18:08  matthias-: imacake: well, ive got Mac OS Extended (Journaled now
18:08  crilly: avalon: is it a POP3 account or IMAP?
18:09  imacake: matthias-, thats a linux thing... but its seirously ultrafast. like double speed ! :O
18:09  avalon: crilly, POP3
18:09  matthias-: imacake: hmmm
18:09  crilly: avalon: Ah right. That does make things more difficult.
18:09  matthias-: imacake: but can i mount it uner osx?
18:09  crilly: avalon: For future ease, move to IMAP now.
18:10  imacake: matthias-, highly possibly. create one and check
18:10  matthias-: imacake: create it using...
18:10  imacake: iPartition doesnt have it ?
18:10  matthias-: dunno
18:10  avalon: crilly, I use several POP3 accounts and I was trying to avoid having to recreate all accounts.
18:10  matthias-: i dont know if i should buy it ;D
18:11  crilly: avalon: Who is the ISP of those accounts? This is what I have discovered about the Mail.app mail storage: Mail.app stores messages as .emlx files in ~/Library/Mail/TYPE-ACCOUNT/ eg. ~/Library/Mail/POP-user@example.com/
18:11  imacake: matthias-, GPartEd is good. maybe you can download the source and compile it for mac
18:11  imacake: (free&opensource)
18:12  crilly: imacake: You can get Linux images that have it on.
18:12  crilly: In fact, there is a Linux distro designed to be used for that exact purpose, amongst other system maintenance things
18:12  imacake: crilly, i know. but who wants to reboot all time ?
18:13  crilly: Why do you need to reboot everytime after creating a partition?
18:13  mrapple: any *mac* users for testing s.bzextreme.com? ;P
18:13  avalon: crilly, nothing changed. I just need to move it from one hard drive to another.
18:14  mrapple: more specifically, -> http://s.bzextreme.com/global/Overcast%200.1.zip
18:15  crilly: mrapple: You might find it hard getting people to just run your binaries from you

18:48  crilly: I assume you have a normal keyboard?
18:49  avalon: I have the same keyboard which came with my Mac.
18:49  crilly: Control, Alt or Command combined with an F key gives different results.
18:49  avalon: Though it doesn' t have a fc key.
18:49  crilly: Oh, and Shift.
18:50  avalon: Shift doesn't work.
18:50  MrSin: Have a good day all and thanks for letting me visit :)...
18:51  crilly: Shift + F3 will result in Expose, but a really slow-motion version.
18:51  js_: avalon: good question, i've wondered that as well
18:52  avalon: yes, I was googling but nothing came as result.

19:02  imacake: thats ext2 o.O not ?
19:02  matthias-: yeah
19:02  matthias-: what were you talking about?
19:02  imacake: XFS
19:02  matthias-: ah
19:02  imacake: ext2 is an old FS...
19:02  matthias-: bioe
19:02  imacake: not journaled at all
19:02  matthias-: nope
19:02  matthias-: xfs is not there
19:03  matthias-: what does it stand for?
19:03  imacake: X-fS
19:03  imacake: *FS
19:03  imacake: :P
19:03  imacake: i think. but actually no idea
19:04  matthias-: imacake: what about hfs?:D
19:04  imacake: hfs is instable as i heard
19:04  imacake: or was that resierfs
19:04  matthias-: well ipartition says it does xfs
19:05  imacake: why dont you make one D: ?
19:05  imacake: btw. i could copy a XFS partition with like... 20MB size
19:06  imacake: then you'd put it into some other fake partition like ext2, but overwrite it with dd
19:06  imacake: but the header wont get overwritten so it will think its an ext2 partition still and make an error :(
19:06  matthias-: well i cant see
19:06  matthias-: XFS
19:06  matthias-: here
19:06  matthias-: ;D
19:07  imacake: try compiling gparted for mac...
19:07  imacake: or look it up
19:07  imacake: its really awesome
19:08  matthias-: well i just bought ipartition
19:08  imacake: bad choice
19:08  imacake: there are almost always free and opensource alternatives
19:08  matthias-: fujisan: told me to get it
19:08  matthias-: !!
19:09  imacake: how much did it cost ?
19:12  matthias-: £35
19:12  imacake: ugh
19:12  imacake: o.o
19:13  imacake: some mac apps are seriously idiotically priced
19:13  matthias-: ok screw it
19:13  matthias-: i'll refund it
19:14  fujisan: lol
19:14  evilbug: fujisan: yo yo.
19:14  fujisan: matthias-: i told you it was expensive
19:14  fujisan: :D
19:14  fujisan: i didnt say you had to get it
19:14  fujisan: i said it worked for me
19:14  fujisan: hi bugsy :)
19:15  evilbug: fujisan: what's shaking?
19:15  fujisan: not much
19:15  fujisan: just listening to some indie music
19:15  fujisan: you?
19:15  fujisan: matthias-: sorry :(
19:16  fujisan: matthias-: :(
19:17  fujisan: matthias-: now i feel bad :(
19:18  imacake: fujisan, mattias-... learn forgiving. ask on some forums if someone would like it for 33punds :P
19:18  fujisan: matthias-: :(
19:18  fujisan: imacake: i really like ipartition though
19:19  imacake: all software that costs, and where are alternatives... sucks
19:19  imacake: like MS Excel
19:19  imacake: etc
19:19  fujisan: imacake: but i feel bad now :(
19:19  fujisan: i thought i was helping someone
19:19  imacake: i wont start soul recovery on a public channel lol
19:20  matthias-: fujisan: yeah
19:20  matthias-: you should 
19:20  matthias-: ;-)
19:20  matthias-: i'll refund it
19:20  fujisan: i am sorry man but for it works 
19:20  fujisan: me*
19:20  matthias-: no the file system i wants
19:21  fujisan: and btw be careful with ntfs partitions which you use under os x :o
19:21  thelostpatrol: never recommend paid software unless you are also listing free alternatives
19:21  fujisan: thelostpatrol:  i didnt know that
19:21  fujisan: i apologize matthias- 
19:21  thelostpatrol: and more importantly, as a buyer, don't buy software unless you research free alternatives
19:21  thelostpatrol: fuj, i don't think you did anything wrong actually
19:22  torchie: how about never recommend bad software unless you're also listing good alternatives
19:22  thelostpatrol: heh
19:22  thelostpatrol: nice rule but too subjective to be put into effect
19:22  fujisan: thelostpatrol:  maybe not but i feel somewhat responsible for matthias- buying ipartition
19:23  thelostpatrol: you're about 10% responsible
19:23  thelostpatrol: :P
19:23  fujisan: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/15360/ipartition
19:24  evilbug: fujisan: listening to dnb currently, trying to schedule out my day. really busy today.
19:24  fujisan: Just to make this clear on the main page, it is not true that you can "just use Disk Utility" (or, for that matter, the command line "diskutil" tool). Disk Utility's support for resizing partitions is extremely limited, and as such is only useful in simple cases, where there is no need to move a partition from its current location on the disk, and the partitions you are resizing must be using journaled HFS+ (unlike iPartition, which can resi
19:24  fujisan: sort of HFS+, FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS, and which can move partitions when necessary). << this is why i buyed it the developer posted this on macupdate
19:25  fujisan: and i didnt know about alternatives expect for gparted which is a linux tool
19:25  imacake: fujisan, i'd reboot my computer to use gprated instead of paying 35pounds.
19:25  imacake: maybe you can port gprated to mac
19:27  fujisan: imacake: gparted is confusing
19:27  imacake: huh
19:27  fujisan: and not really userfriendly but that's just my biased opinion about anything linux
19:27  imacake: linux is very userfriendly
19:27  fujisan: otherwise people would use linux over mac osx
19:28  fujisan: for the same argument as why you use gparted over ipartition imo
19:28  imacake: i dont want to want to blame mac
19:28  imacake: well, depending what linux distro you saw...
19:28  imacake: its generally more userfriendly
19:29  imacake: mac messes some stuff up. like i'd like to see the exact filenames, not anything like... real is "Users", but i see "Benutzer" in the gui brower
19:30  imacake: you should try ubuntu 11.04 (ubuntu, not xubuntu or kubuntu) natty when its out
19:31 +Branes: Ewwbuntu.
19:31  imacake: huh
19:31  torchie: desktop linux more like derptop linux
19:32 +Branes: The entirety of the OSS community fail at consistency & transparency in the interface.
19:32  imacake: you can get KDE or xfce or openbox or fluxbox or lxde or write your own GE
19:32 +Branes: Apple make interfaces, Microsoft make in-your-faces, linux tweakers are still arguing over how to chip flint.
19:32  imacake: the interface isnt the OS itself
19:32  torchie: branes do you have that on a script
19:32 +Branes: Interface first. No exceptions.
19:33  imacake: Branes: no way
19:33  imacake: -.-
19:33  imacake: can mac run without gui ?
19:33  imacake: no
19:33 +Branes: And that's why I still use MacOS.
19:34  imacake: have you ever triend linux ?
19:34  imacake: which ?
19:34 +Branes: Yes, I still fire up distros to see where they're at development-wise.
19:34  imacake: which ?
19:35 +Branes: Several. I had Ewwbuntu 11 on the AMD-box last month.
19:35  imacake: Ewwbuntu
19:35  imacake: o.O
19:35  torchie: crunchbang's cooler because it has an adorable startup sound
19:38  imacake: Branes, ewwbuntu sucks...
19:38  fujisan: lol
19:38 +Branes: So does anything based on a commandline-capable core.
19:39  imacake: Branes, Mac is that too
19:39  fujisan: yeah if ubuntu was so great it would be competing with windows more
19:39 +Branes: Only OSX.
19:39  torchie: aren't ubuntu and mint like, the only desktop distros where they care about people
19:39 * Branes doesn't like OSX much either.
19:39  imacake: Branes, lol... XD
19:39  imacake: torchie, no o.O
19:39 +Branes: Of the currently-shipping operating systems, the *only* one with any merit is iOS.
19:40  torchie: webos dammit
19:40  imacake: Branes, do you like games ?
19:40 +Branes: Of past operating systems, I stick with MacOS 8.6.
19:40 +Branes: I don't game, I don't do video.
19:40  torchie: I don't like games
19:40  torchie: I LOVE games
19:40  torchie: and if I don't love it
19:40  torchie: I don't swallow
19:40  torchie: no wait, wrong movie
19:41  imacake: Branes, all apple stuff is unix based. and tho CLI
19:41  torchie: all apple stuff post-OSX
19:41  imacake: iOS, too!!!
19:41  fujisan: Branes:  you use your imagination and read books right? :)
19:41 +Branes: Yes, fuji
19:41  fujisan: i like books as well
19:41  imacake: i like netbeans
19:41  fujisan: hehe
19:42  torchie: woo books
19:42 +Branes: imacake: I'm aware of this; that's why I don't like OSX, and the only reason why I consider iOS as a meritable OS is that there is essentially no access to the kernel.
19:42 +Branes: MacOS 8.6 has *no* kernel, no commandline structure, nor any way to add one.
19:42 +Branes: (and for that I am greatly thankful)
19:42  imacake: thus insecure
19:42  torchie: how
19:42 +Branes: MacOS 8.6 is more secure than OSX, by several orders of magnitude.
19:43  crilly: It has no kernel? I thought a kernel was what made an OS? I thought an OS WAS the kernel and everything else was simply software un top of the kernel?
19:43  imacake: crilly, it has a kernel. a nanokernel. its ofc that small that its almost nothing...
19:43 +Branes: No, it has no kernel.
19:43  imacake: fail
19:43  imacake: it has a kernel
19:43  imacake: dumbass
19:43 +Branes: No, it has no kernel.
19:44  imacake: OMG
19:44  imacake: i dont know what they told you. but every OS must have a kernel
19:44  imacake: else it is no OS
19:44  imacake: but apps running on the bios itself
19:44  imacake: thus assembly stuff
19:44  torchie: exactly?
19:44 +Branes: Pre-OSX Macs have no BIOS.
19:44  torchie: well anyway you guys keep arguing I'm gonna google "mac os 8 kernel"
19:44  imacake: thus extremly incompitable over all the macines
19:44  imacake: lol
19:44  imacake: Branes. you fail totaly
19:45  crilly: "Apple intended Copland as a completely native PowerPC operating system offering intelligent agents, a microkernel..."
19:45  crilly: Copland = MacOS 8.
19:45  torchie: appalachian spring
19:45 +Branes: Cake, I've been using technology since the mid-1970's, and Macs since they came out. I know exactly what I'm talking about, and what the difference is between an OS with a kernel, and an OS without one.
19:45  imacake: microkernel is bigger and supports more stuff than nanokernel
19:45  imacake: I've been making an Os by myself
19:46 +Branes: Prior to OSX, MacOS did not have a kernel. It didn't need one.
19:46  imacake: ofc didnt succeed to get far, but the first parts it was about was KERNEL 
19:46  imacake: Branes: it wasnt any OS then
19:46  imacake: it wasnt able to multitask
19:46  imacake: it hadnt any filesystem
19:46 +Branes: It used co-operative multitasking.
19:46  imacake: no good gui
19:46  crilly: It had a microkernel.
19:46 +Branes: The best GUI. Still the best GUI, by far.
19:47  crilly: Rather, it HAS a microj=kernel.
19:47  crilly: microkernel*
19:47 +Branes: No, crilly. It did not even have a microkernel.
19:47 +Branes: The OS was just another program.
19:47  imacake: i prefer beliving wikipedia than one guy
19:47 +Branes: That's how things were done in the early days.
19:47  crilly: Hmm indeed. Wikipedia states otherwise.
19:48  crilly: Something has to come between the hardware and the software - that's the kernel.
19:48  imacake: Kernel type 	Monolithic for 68k, nanokernel for PowerPC
19:48  imacake: crilly, not fully :P
19:48  crilly: Unless all software on OS8 simply accessed the hardware directly to get things done.
19:48 +Branes: Not so, crilly.
19:48  torchie: i dunno, the iOS GUI is pretty badass
19:48 +Branes: Pre-OSX *anything* could access the hardware.
19:48  imacake: without a kernel you're unable to do multitasking
19:48  crilly: OK, so feel free to supply evidence to support your cliams.
19:49  imacake: yeah
19:49  crilly: I've provided evidence you're wrong, in the form of a trust worthy source, Wikipedia. You're asking us to take your word for it.
19:49 +Branes: ... wikipedia? Trustworthy?? BAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
19:49 +Branes: I trust Wikipedia as far as I can spit the Titanic.
19:49  imacake: could someone kick/ban that guy ?
19:49  crilly: Now you're avoiding the subject.
19:50  crilly: imacake: Such an action wouldn't help us get to the bottom of this matter :)
19:50  imacake: but its just aggressive words...
19:50  imacake: they wont help
19:50  torchie: yeah I want to see how it doesn't have a kernel
19:50  imacake: Branes wont change because we shout at him
19:50  crilly: Once you've provided evidence that proofs OS8 has nothing that could be considered or viewed as a kernel, I will happily adjust my position to agree, Branes 
19:50  imacake: this conversation is poitless
19:51  imacake: Branes
19:51  imacake: an OS is kernel and software
19:51 +Branes: Look. When MacOS came out, half of the operating system lived in 64 KB of ROM, the other half -- a driving program that provided the graphical interface -- took up 101 KB of a 400KB floppy disc.
19:51  imacake: a OS cant exists without kernel
19:51 +Branes: It had no kernel.
19:51 +Branes: Yes it can.
19:51  imacake: that violates the definition
19:51 +Branes: By today's standards, yes.
19:52  LordDragon: all OSes have kernels
19:52  imacake: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system
19:52  crilly: Branes: The second half of Mac OS, the GUI application, how did it access hardware to draw on screen?
19:52 +Branes: By poking the relevant pixels directly into the display buffer area of RAM.
19:53  crilly: I think Branes is likely correct in this matter, but I need proof.
19:53  crilly: Branes: And how did software, written by third parties, get the same job done?
19:53 +Branes: Exactly the same way.
19:53  crilly: How did they access the memory? How and what was it addressed by?
19:53 +Branes: Directly.
19:53  imacake: branes, thats impossible
19:54  crilly: Indeed. What provided that direct access, Branes ?
19:54 +Branes: Formulate an address, write a value into it.
19:54  imacake: how can they arrange in which window to draw in ?
19:54  ritsuka: the first chapter of "mac os x internals" has got a chapter on classic mac os
19:54  imacake: (crilly, branes was right in the case that the gui thing wrote it directly to ram)
19:54  ritsuka: http://books.google.com/books?id=K8vUkpOXhN4C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=mac+os+8+nanokernel&source=bl&ots=OJqgUZWqXz&sig=RL4mpxhbuO7hxfTs_vi7j_uM8OQ&hl=en&ei=X9_7TKCTGuiG4gaq9-GVBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mac%20os%208%20nanokernel&f=false
19:54  ritsuka: sorry for the long link
19:54 +Branes: By looking at a pre-defined area of RAM to see where a window was situated in memory.
19:54  mrapple: lol hey a_metorite
19:55  imacake: Branes: thats the kernel!! congrats
19:55  mrapple: thought you were only in #bzfx ;P
19:55  matthias-: imacake: you've got bootcamp with win 7 ?
19:55 +Branes: It's not a kernel, imacake.
19:55  crilly: ritsuka: Pretty much what my Wikipedia link said. Good link though.
19:55  imacake: Branes, it acts like a kernel. arranging all the stuff it had
19:55  imacake: matthias-, win7? im linux
19:55  imacake: and whats bootcamp ?
19:55 +Branes: It didn't arrange things.
19:55  matthias-: imacake: no bootcamp?
19:56  matthias-: hmm, fujisan was that u ?
19:56  crilly: Branes: There will be something there giving access to the hardware and or providing APIs to draw on screen, play a sound, etc.
19:56  fujisan: matthias-: i have that setup but hardly use win7 
19:56  fujisan: i am afraid windows will damage the Mac :<
19:56  crilly: Something generally abstracts the hardware layer.
19:56  imacake: fujisan, matthias-: GRUB ?
19:56  matthias-: lol
19:56  imacake: fujisan, it wont
19:56  matthias-: well im just wondering 
19:57  matthias-: need windows for games
19:57  matthias-: ...
19:57  matthias-: ;-)
19:57  imacake: dont game
19:57  imacake: im happy with my linux. i dont wanna games
19:57  crilly: Once I dump 8GB of RAM into my MBP (the RAM will be delivered next week), I shall dual boot Windows 7 also :)
19:57  imacake: but there are made new games. nuuu!
19:57  fujisan: Branes:  does have a good point if you dont game and dont do videos your hardware will last a lot longer :)
19:58  imacake: how can someone use old mac os 8...
19:58  imacake: i mean, no apps
19:58  imacake: old.. not nice ui
19:58  fujisan: imacake: how can people still use radio?
19:58  matthias-: yeah ive got 4gb ram
19:58  matthias-: dont want xp
19:58  torchie: as the state of games stands, they are better written than played
19:58  fujisan: how can people still breath air
19:58  crilly: It's not about loving what you want imacake, but loving what you have. Branes values what he has because it does the job for him.
19:58  imacake: radio is still used by everyone
19:58  fujisan: how can people still eat food
19:58  imacake: but masoc8...
19:58  fujisan: lol
19:58  imacake: okay, sorry
19:59 +Branes: I still use System 6 in the studio.
19:59  imacake: Mac os 6?
19:59  crilly: This is the face I pulled when Branes said there is no kernel in MacOS 8: http://tinyurl.com/35392xt
19:59 +Branes: There aren't too many OSes that let me do everything I want of them without a keyboard attached :)
19:59  torchie: can system 6 handle modern audio?
19:59  veovis_muaddib: Branes: Well, OS X annoys me with its lack of keyboard only support
19:59 +Branes: imacake: Apple did not adopt the name MacOS until version 8.
19:59  torchie: or has audio engineering not changed so much since then
19:59  fujisan: Branes:  do you know assembly language?
19:59  crilly: No, only vinyl.
20:00 +Branes: fujisan: Yes. 6502, 6800 and Z80.
20:00  imacake: i dont care about assembly...
20:00  imacake: theres new stuff out. C++...
20:00  fujisan: i know one very good c64 and amiga programmer he always rants about how great the 68K Motorola chip was to code for and how programmers used to have direct access to the hardware
20:01  imacake: real mode
20:01  torchie: power over hardware is how you make good software
20:01  imacake: its insecure
20:01 +Branes: torchie: pre-OSX can definitely handle 'modern' audio, if the hardware is sufficient. Digidesign Pro Tools first appeared with System 3.2/Finder 5.3, but there were audio processing applications on the Macintosh before that.
20:01  fujisan: Branes:  so you never had any Amigas?
20:01 +Branes: "Assembly language is the only true programming environment. Leave high level languages to those with low intelligence."
20:01  fujisan: only Apple?
20:02  imacake: Branes... linux has definitely better UI, and is more userfriendly than Mac OS 8
20:02 +Branes: I was an Apple-only person until 2000.
20:02  fujisan: Branes:  :)
20:02  torchie: which linux?
20:02  fujisan: http://www.codeanthem.com/blog/2010/04/old-programmers-vs-young-programmers/
20:02  fujisan: :D
20:02  torchie: linux is a kernel
20:02  imacake: ie ubuntu
20:02  imacake: but its used on all the distros. i know its a kernel...
20:02  crilly: Linux has no kernel
20:02 * crilly hides
20:02  torchie: lol
20:03  imacake: xD
20:03  fujisan: torchie:  so os x will switch to the linux kernel any day soon?
20:03 * Branes chuckles
20:03 +Branes: linux is all kernel.
20:03  fujisan: :D
20:03  imacake: Branes, we know
20:03  torchie: fujisan: lol
20:03  matthias-: hmm, should i take 32 or 64 bit?
20:03  imacake: You just killed a wonderful joke >:(
20:03  imacake: matthias-, depending on what your pc is
20:03  torchie: all kernel no action
20:03  matthias-: imacake: macbook pro
20:03  matthias-: ;-)
20:03  matthias-: unibody
20:03 +Branes: You don't spend almost forty years messing with technology and not learn the difference :)
20:03  matthias-: 5,4 
20:03  matthias-: i think
20:03  matthias-: ;)
20:03  imacake: thats 64bit for sure
20:03 +Branes: (yes, I'm *that* old :))
20:04  matthias-: what's the difference?
20:04  crilly: Branes is at least 60.
20:04  KeeperOfTheSoul: Branes: you'd be amazed at what some people are capable of ignoring :)
20:04  imacake: matthias-, the words are 64 bits in size instead of 32bits
20:04  matthias-: imacake: i mean, what's the major difference in software
20:04  imacake: between what software ?
20:05  KeeperOfTheSoul: in the words of Churchill, "Men occationally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened"
20:05 * imacake is brb. "Toilate needs me"
20:06  crilly: silly men :(
20:06 * imacake is back. "PC needs me"
20:07  imacake: yaaa, silence
20:07  crilly: imacake: Don't make that away script something you use often in here, it might just end up being inserted where the sun doesn't shine.
20:07 +Branes: Such occurences no longer amaze or confound me, Keeps, I am welll aware of the limitations of human stupidity, ie, there are none :)
20:07  fujisan: imacake: who killed a wonderful joke?
20:08  imacake: Branes... but nevermind
20:08  imacake: crilly, i dont use scripts. it was just made by myself
20:09  imacake: and anyway, XChat displays inactive users in gray instead black
20:09  fujisan: hi kateweb  :)
20:09  kateweb: hey
20:09  imacake: hi, whoever you are :D
20:13  fujisan: :)
20:21  matthias-: Hmm, 
20:21  matthias-: can i use bootcamp without having the CD?
20:21  matthias-: well, my drive is broken
20:23  crilly: I think Bootcamp requires a CD.
20:23  crilly: You'll have to get an external drive me thinks.
20:23  matthias-: ;<<<<<
20:24  imacake: whats bootcamp
20:24  matthias-: grub
20:24  matthias-: ;-)
20:24 +Branes: More than that.
20:24  matthias-: more/less
20:24  matthias-: ;]
20:25  beterraba: hi, what games do you like to play on mac?
20:25  imacake: doesnt grub work on apple things ?
20:25  imacake: beterraba, www.minecraft.net
20:25 +Branes: Boot Camp is a partitioning tool, BIOS emulator, bootloader and a driver suite for Apple's hardware for Windows.
20:25  imacake: its for all platforms, because in java
20:26 +Branes: imacake: No, because Apple's hardware is custom -- trying to run a linux directly on Apple hardware can kill the CPU.
20:26  imacake: :S
20:26  imacake: but grub isnt linux
20:26  imacake: its native assembly code
20:27 +Branes: An Intel CPU does not automatically mean a generic-class PC. Apple love to change hardware to suit their software :)
20:27  imacake: i dont know that stuff...
20:27  fujisan: imacake: so you plan on getting a mac?
20:27  fujisan: :O
20:27  imacake: ive been to a shop
20:27  imacake: and it was nice
20:27  fujisan: oh ok
20:27  kateweb: you should get your drive fixed
20:28  imacake: but i planned buying my own parts and build a computer myself to suit exactly my needs
20:28  imacake: and i wanted to install ubuntu...
20:28 +Branes: matthias-: The way Boot Camp is structured, a working internal optical drive is mandatory (except on the MacBook Air where an external optical drive is mandatory).
20:29  fujisan: imacake: os x is so x much better than ubuntu
20:29  imacake: i dont belive it. sorry
20:29  fujisan: ;D
20:29  beterraba: imacake: lol wtf this game
20:29  beterraba: hahuas
20:29  imacake: minecraft is a nice game
20:29  beterraba: i didn`t get the idea of game
20:29  imacake: well
20:29  imacake: its more fun after some time
20:29  fujisan: Branes:  yes that is correct
20:29  imacake: and ONLY in multiplayer
20:30  imacake: trust me
20:30 +Branes: It's one of those fake environments where you build things and blow things up. It appeals to the obsessive-compulsives.
20:30  imacake: and the new alpha versino is supercool. costs 9.95€
20:30  fujisan: luckily my kidbrothers got me a free copy of win7
20:30 +Branes: There is no other purpose in Minecraft.
20:30  fujisan: Branes:  :)
20:30  imacake: fujisan, the helpout-people in the market watched me not to fuck their compters up. they saw me typing stuff into the terminal lol
20:31  fujisan: Branes:  and it appeals to the people who are creative enough to want to built something
20:31  fujisan: imacake: hmz ok
20:31  imacake: xD
20:31  fujisan: imacake: they should use a kiosk mode then
20:31  imacake: huh
20:32  imacake: kiost
20:32  imacake: *kiost
20:32  imacake: **kiosk lol
20:32  imacake: what do you mean by that ?
20:32  fujisan: well it basically doesnt keep the entire session into temporary memory and all changes are gone when booted
20:32  matthias-: Branes: seriously?
20:32  fujisan: i mean it does
20:32  imacake: but they worried i might fuck up root
20:33  matthias-: Branes: no bootcamp w/o an optical drive?
20:33  matthias-: Branes: even thou i used bootcamp many times before
20:33  fujisan: imacake: then those machines werent in some sort of kiosk mode apparently
20:33  imacake: dunno
20:33  imacake: but it was funny
20:33  imacake: xD
20:33  fujisan: i dont know if os x has a kiosk mode
20:34  imacake: idk
20:34  imacake: but i want to try it out
20:34  fujisan: there is this app called deepfreeze which does and i think they have an os x version as well
20:34  imacake: is anyone C++ programmer and can compare development on Mac and linux ?
20:34 +Branes: matthias-: Yes, seriously
20:35  fujisan: Once Deep Freeze Mac is installed on a workstation, any changes made to the computer—regardless of whether they are accidental or malicious—are never permanent. Deep Freeze Mac provides immediate immunity from many of the problems that plague computers today—accidental system misconfiguration, malicious software activity, and incidental system degradation.
20:35 * imacake G2Gs
20:35  fujisan: public places such as libraries and schools must use something similar as well
20:35  imacake: bai everyone
20:35  fujisan: bu bye
20:35  imacake: cool community

21:02 +Branes: matthias-: There is a possibility that your faulty optical drive is causing interference with your hard drive -- they both meet in the same SATA controller. 
21:02  matthias-: Branes: can i just unplug the super drive?
21:03  matthias-: superdrive sees all dvds as blank
21:03 +Branes: If you're going to open the machine, you may as well remove the drive completely.
21:03 +Branes: Sounds like the drive has had its DVD laser die.
21:03  matthias-: Branes: i did open it many times
21:04  matthias-: dont know how remove the drive thou
21:04 +Branes: Slotload optical drives are a major PITA.
21:04 +Branes: look on iFixit, they've got pictorial guides.
21:04  fujisan: my Wii one works great Branes 
21:04  fujisan: nintendo make stuff that lasts
21:04  fujisan: great built quality
21:04  fujisan: apple could take some pointers
21:05 +Branes: Nintendo didn't make the drive, fuji. It's a Matsita, so it'll die before long.
21:05  fujisan: ;P
21:05  matthias-: The disc can’t be burned, because the device failed to calibrate the laser power level for this media.
21:05  matthias-: that's what's wrong with it
21:05  matthias-: can't burn
21:05  matthias-: cant read
21:05  fujisan: before long is bad right Branes ?
21:05 +Branes: Yup, the DVD lasers have died.
21:06  fujisan: i guess it depends on how much you use it
21:07  matthias-: I never used my superdrive
21:08  matthias-: the fact that you need optical drive for bootcamp is just bad
21:09  matthias-: The disk cannot be partitioned because some files cannot be moved.
21:10 +Branes: iPartition would solve that, but only if you boot from the iPartition DVD.
21:11  matthias-: Branes: yeah, but how can i fix it
21:11  matthias-: ;]
21:11 +Branes: Replace your optical drive.
21:11  matthias-: what files are those i mean
21:11  fujisan: lol
21:11  fujisan: poor matthias- 
21:12  matthias-: there must be a way
21:12  fujisan: Branes any clue what can be done with an EFI Filesystem?
21:12  matthias-: to boot it from an externaldrive
21:12  matthias-: without using bootcamp
21:12 +Branes: If you have OSX installed onto an external FireWire drive, you can boot from that.
21:12  matthias-: I dont. I only have usb trive.
21:12  matthias-: drive*
21:12 +Branes: fuji, EFI is not a file system.
21:13 +Branes: Then you need to get your optical drive replaced, or buy a FireWire enclosure.
21:13  matthias-: what's cheaper?
21:13  fujisan: ipartition offer it as an option to format a partition after
21:14  CEnTR4L: Is there a way to check whether my optical drive that is on the MBP is working absolutely %100 or its not preforming that good anymore?
21:14 +Branes: The FireWire enclosure would be cheaper, but it still does not solve your problem regarding Boot Camp.
21:14 +Branes: None that I'm aware of, Central.
21:15  CEnTR4L: I gotta say I have made three anatomies to my MBP and I'm not Apple certified, I'm afraid I have messed up something...
21:15  matthias-: http://tubeshards.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/install-windows-to-a-macintosh-usb-drive/
21:15  matthias-: what about this?
21:15  matthias-: old, but still should work
21:16 +Branes: If you have not already installed Boot Camp at some stage (so that the EFI BIOS Emulation Layer has been added to the 200 MB EFI partition of your internal hard drive) then it won't work.
21:17  matthias-: i have
21:17  matthias-: had it working
21:17  matthias-: a few times before
21:17  matthias-: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa;jsessionid=0DA9D9F1E88E4DCB4D5DE1F468F16718.node0?messageID=12253702&#12253702
21:17 +Branes: then give it a go
21:17  matthias-: He booted my MBP 13" into safe mode and voila I was able to partition the drive for bootcamp. He said there must have been a roque process running somewhere that was interfering with the partitioning. Safe mode bypassed the rogue process. 
21:17  matthias-: Branes: how do i check it if ive got the bios emulation layet?
21:17  matthias-: holding C key or smth?
21:18  fujisan: c is to boot from install disk i thought
21:19  fujisan: optical disk

21:38  matthias-: d
21:39  Swian: bummer
21:42  imacake: matthias-, iPartition ?
21:42  matthias-: imacake: nope
21:43 +Branes: He needs to replace his optical drive, that'll solve all his immediate problems
21:43  imacake: what are his problems ?
21:43  imacake: and optical drive = CD or HDD ?
21:43 +Branes: Can't repartition, can't install Boot Camp, can't defrag -- all of which require a working internal optical drive.
21:44  matthias-: Branes: ok, what I can do
21:44  matthias-: imacake: cd
21:44  imacake: what doesnt work ?
21:44 +Branes: matthias-: As I've told you four times already, replace your optical drive.
21:44  matthias-: imacake: laser.
21:44  imacake: ow
21:44  matthias-: Branes: yeah, but what i can do now is the following
21:45  imacake: you can loose connection
21:45 +Branes: matthias-: Stop messing around until you can get the optical drive replaced.
21:45 +Branes: That's all you can do.
21:45  imacake: Branes: let him at least tell us 'something'
21:45  matthias-: Branes: i can boot windows install from USB, disconnect internal HDD and install windows on an external drive.
21:46 +Branes: He's already told us what the faults are, not my fault you weren't around :)
21:46  matthias-: then install bootcamp drivers, voila ;-)
21:46  imacake: matthias-, do it ?
21:46  matthias-: imacake: I am ;-)
21:46  imacake: okay... have fun
21:46 +Branes: Except that doesn't work because of the way Boot Camp and the EFI BIOS emulation layer are written, you *MUST* have a working internal optiucal drive for those to work.
21:46  matthias-: thou, the question is... do I have an 4GB pen drive...
21:46  imacake: wait. is it possible to install windows on apple computers ?
21:47 +Branes: Duh.
21:47  matthias-: Branes: I don't need bootcamp for that
21:47  matthias-: do I ?
21:47 +Branes: Apple give you the drivers and add a compatibility layer.
21:47 +Branes: Yes you do.
21:47  matthias-: No I dont, not when I'll unplug the internal HDD
21:47 +Branes: Won't work. Boot Camp and the BIOS emulator are hard-coded to *expect* internal HD and optical.
21:48  matthias-: http://guides.macrumors.com/Boot_Camp_Windows_XP_On_External_Drive
21:48  matthias-: that about this?
21:49 +Branes: Same problems.
21:49 +Branes: You still need a functional *internal* optical drive to get that going.
21:49  matthias-: for what?
21:49 +Branes: Boot Camp.
21:50  matthias-: there is no bootcamp used there
21:50  imacake: Branes, but wheres the MBR?
21:50  imacake: in first sector too ?
21:50  imacake: 512 bytes ?
21:50 +Branes: matt, then whomever wrote that article had installed Boot Camp previously.
21:50  imacake: or did they adjust it ?
21:51  matthias-: Branes: I had bootcamp installed previously as I said before
21:51 +Branes: imacake: It doesn't have an MBR, it is not supported. What Windows *thinks* is an MBR is actually a GPT re-mapped through the EFI BIOS Emulation layer that is part of Apple's low level firmware.
21:51  matthias-: so the EFI should be modified
21:51  matthias-: Branes: is there any way to check what is in my EFI ?
21:52 +Branes: matt, if you have either reformatted or repartitioned your internal drive since the last time you installed Boot Camp, then the BIOS emulation layer is no longer present.
21:52  matthias-: or what lines are there?
21:52  matthias-: Branes: well i got rid of the windows partition, that's it
21:52 +Branes: No, there's no way to check that I know of - it's proprietry information that Apple refuse to divulge.
21:52 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
21:53 +Branes: matthias-: Then you're out of luck, that removed the BIOS emulation layer as well.
21:53  matthias-: what about this? http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=11953
21:53 +Branes: No matter which way you approach this, it all comes back to the same solution to get past your problem -- replace the internal optical drive.
21:53  imacake: Branes, is it hard to install ubuntu on an iMac, MacBook Pro :3 ?
21:54  matthias-: Branes: I can't get hold of an optical drive
21:54 +Branes: imacake: It can be, but doing so will kill the CPU due to over-voltage.
21:54  matthias-: that's the problem, and for a few weeks I won't be able to.
21:54  imacake: huh why overvolatage?
21:54 +Branes: Then you're limited to Windows inside a virtual machine only, matt, until you do.
21:55 +Branes: imacake: Apple use a proprietry power management chip that is completely brain-dead, the host OS *MUST* micromanage everything. No linux distro can control it correctly.
21:55 +Branes: Without the right control, the CPU is left in a permanent overvolt state.
21:55  imacake: =\
21:55  imacake: and if i modify the kernel myself ?
21:55 +Branes: It is not a kernel issue.
21:56 +Branes: It is the hardware itself.
21:56  matthias-: Branes: well stuff like that just pisses me off ;-)
21:56  imacake: or start a root process to control that chip ?
21:56  matthias-: it's only apple that would require you to have a working optical drive
21:56  matthias-: for stuff like that
21:56 +Branes: If you can do what dozens of others have tried to do and failed -- successfully reverse engineer Apple's SMC driver kext -- then you will make a *lot* of idio^H^H^Hlinux tweakers happy.
21:57  matthias-: so then VMware or paralels 
21:57 +Branes: matthias-: Oracle Virtualbox. Free, and almost as good as VMware Fusion.
21:58  matthias-: vmware fusion - ive got license for
21:58 +Branes: Then use that.
21:58  imacake: matthias-, qemu or vbox :D ?
22:00  imacake: Branes, how are applications managed under mac ?
22:00  matthias-: yawn.
22:00  matthias-: imacake: badly :>
22:00  imacake: and how do i install stuff ?
22:01  matthias-: drag and drop
22:01  imacake: on linux i get .deb packages
22:01  imacake: huh
22:01 +Branes: imacake: 1. download app. 2. drag to desired location. 3. run
22:01  matthias-: well, not on every linux
22:01  imacake: bah
22:01  matthias-: on debian you do ;)
22:01 +Branes: There is no package management, no dependecy system. They're not needed.
22:01  imacake: ofc its not needed
22:01  imacake: but it helps a lot
22:02  imacake: well. can i put any app to any location ?
22:02 +Branes: It's one needless complexity that Apple have managed to get rid of. Now if they could only get rid of permissions ...
22:02 +Branes: Yes you can, cake.
22:02  imacake: what the fuck.
22:02 +Branes: Even ru them from the downloaded archive.
22:02  imacake: DONT GET RID OF permissions
22:02 +Branes: Doesn't matter where they are.
22:03  imacake: are you crazy
22:03  imacake: o.O
22:03 +Branes: They're not needed, cake.
22:03  imacake: they are
22:03 +Branes: MacOS spent twenty years not needing them.
22:03  imacake: ...
22:03  torchie: not needing what
22:03 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
22:03  torchie: what are we talking about
22:03 +Branes: Permissions.
22:03  imacake: without permissions macs will get insecure
22:04  imacake: exactly that element makes unix stuff secure
22:04  imacake: and it will lead mac outside the unix compitablity
22:04 +Branes: Not so. As I told you two hours ago, pre-OSX MacOS is far more secure than OSX *because* it doesn't have permissions.
22:04  imacake: no
22:04 +Branes: Yes. Ask the CIA, they wrote an extensive white paper on it.
22:04  imacake: because virueses for MacOSX dont work on MacOS
22:05  imacake: Branes. you might know a lot. but in some cases you're completely wrong
22:05 +Branes: You may think that, but you can *not* make assumptions about anything Apple, based on how other IT companies & communities operate.
22:06 +Branes: "Think different" is not just marketing-speak, it is a dire warning.
22:06 +Branes: Apple do *EVERYTHING* backwards.
22:06  torchie: whoa whoa
22:06  torchie: expose is just
22:06  torchie: not working
22:07  EdLin: torchie: in what way?
22:08  EdLin: torchie: run WebOS on your mac to cure that, make poor Steve Jobs cry. ;-)

22:12  torchie: the screen on the dell streak is like

22:12  torchie: EdLin: which is pretty much none of them at this point
22:13  torchie: the nexus one came out like 8 months ago
22:13  EdLin: torchie: my HTC HD2 doesn't run a vendor Android, it's impossible to do so. ;-)
22:13  TechnoticRacoon: torchie: the nexus 1
22:13  staticsafe: Google stopped selling them . :(
22:13  torchie: motorola is blurderp, htc is sensederp, G2 isn't completely stock and doesn't run angry birds derp
22:13  torchie: nook is barnes and noblederp
22:13  torchie: galaxy tab is touchderp
22:14  staticsafe: Kindle?
22:14  torchie: (they're also 7 inches, which is incorrect)
22:14 +Branes: why do people still think faildroi is useful is beyond me
22:14  EdLin: staticsafe: you still can get an n1 if you get a free Google Android developer's account.
22:14  TechnoticRacoon: the nook color isnt that bad
22:14  torchie: Branes: it's basically windows again
22:14  staticsafe: EdLin: damn didn't know that thanks
22:14  TechnoticRacoon: the software is alittle laggy, but its pretty decent
22:14  torchie: the nook color has hella hardware for $250
22:14  torchie: omap 3600 series SoC
22:14  EdLin: staticsafe: be aware though, they're usually out of stock, and the new n1s don't have amoled if you like that.
22:15  TechnoticRacoon: Branes: im not too big a fan of android, but if you dont suck you can make something useful out of it
22:15  staticsafe: ah cool
22:15  torchie: I don't appreciate, however, a device that I'd have to "root" or "jailbreak" or "hack" or this or that just to run apps
22:15  EdLin: torchie: iphones are like that too.
22:15  torchie: good thing I don't have an iphone :D
22:15  Kasm279: thats why i want a Pre
22:15  EdLin: yep, you have a palm pre. :)
22:16 +Branes: *sigh* two more years of idiocy to put up with. Roll on ARM, roll on iOS Desktop!
22:16  TechnoticRacoon: web os 2.0 looks nice
22:16  staticsafe: webOS is the only one I haven't used at all
22:16  EdLin: I want a palm pre 2, almost willing to deal with EDGE on TmoUS to run it. Almost, not quite.
22:16  torchie: webos is <3
22:16  torchie: no sprint pre 2 :(
22:16  TechnoticRacoon: Branes: you think apple is going to use arm on the mac line right? or is that someone else
22:16  TingPing: EdLin, dev account is 25$ not free
22:16  EdLin: torchie: sprint has eol'd the pre, they no longer sell webos devices other than the pixie.
22:16  torchie: arm on the mac line would be amazing
22:16  EdLin: TingPing: thought it was free, sorry.
22:17  torchie: edlin yeah and I'm on my 4th goddamn pre
22:17 +Branes: I *know* they are. Parallel-processing multicore ARMs of their own design & manufacture.
22:17  torchie: $60 on craigslist, and the speaker is blown :/
22:17  TechnoticRacoon: i think the palm developer accounts are the only free ones
22:17  EdLin: torchie: wow. someone I know who I sold it to is still on my pre, though the headphones broke while he was using it.
22:17  EdLin: it was a first pre.
22:17  torchie: lucky guy
22:18  torchie: I've never had any electronic device break so much :(
22:18  TechnoticRacoon: Branes: is any varient of arm around the power of  64bit? im not too up to date with that stuff
22:18  EdLin: yeah, the palm pre had bad build quality. I hear the Pre 2 is improved.
22:18  torchie: I hope the HP phone is made of stainless steel and unicorn tears
22:18  torchie: and be a slate
22:18  EdLin: torchie: they did use glass for the screen of the pre 2.
22:18  torchie: the pre 2 is apparently greatly improved
22:18  torchie: I'm not crazy about glass
22:18  torchie: glass shatters when you drop it, and dropping is problem numero uno
22:19  torchie: but apparently glass is more responsive on capacitive screens so
22:19  EdLin: true enough, I did get an otterbox defender for my hd2 because of that.
22:19  torchie: double edged sword, like all swords
22:19 +Branes: No idea Raco, I don't pay attention to that level of detail. But considering Apple all but own ARM Holdings these days, the likelihood of their ARM doing 64 bit is pretty much guaranteed
22:19  EdLin: torchie: I don't use the defender anymore though, too bulky.
22:19  torchie: yeah
22:19  TechnoticRacoon: mkay Branes 
22:19  torchie: can we just not have to use cases

22:52  Swian: wy
22:52  Swian: why

23:03  Kasm279: alexlea: herp, was from 2003
23:04  thelostpatrol: perhaps
23:04  Kasm279: paid $2 for it
23:05  alexlea: i got a free camera once off craigslist
23:05  alexlea: it was broken
23:05  alexlea: but like, all that was broken was the switch that changed it from view mode to shoot mode
23:06  alexlea: all i had to do was take out a screw, and flip the switch form underneath, and leave it in shoot mode
23:06  alexlea: then i sold it for 100 bux
23:07  fujisan: alexlea: thats the spirit
23:07  fujisan: how much did pay for that snowman?

23:07  alexlea: in his yard
23:08  fujisan: oh ok
23:08  crilly: I have a Sony DSC-W12 which eats batteries for breakfast
23:08  alexlea: ok there was much sodetracking
23:08  crilly: I need to remember to remove the batteries when I'm not using it
23:08  alexlea: LordDragon: my offical oppinion on the snowman is that it would be ok in his backyard concealed by a fence, but not in the front yard for peopel's kids, etc to see
23:09  LordDragon: alexlea, i could agree with that. but thats not what the guy wants. he WANTS it to be seen by everyone and for it to upset them
23:10  alexlea: LordDragon: i think it is ok to use contoversial images for artistic projects, such as movies; ie who hasnt seen Schindler's List...problem is ANYONE can claim they were trying to be artistic, so intent is not always easy to gage
23:11  alexlea: but i guess if the intent is to be hateful for the sole sake of haytefulness, i personally dont like it
23:11  LordDragon: alexlea, if it was one single event. id agree. but kkk snowmen and raising the aryan flag? thats not isolated incident
23:11  LordDragon: he clearly LIKES to display offensive things
23:11  alexlea: LordDragon: even one single event, i think his inetnet is obviously hateful
23:12  alexlea: i am not trying to say "oh maybe he was just trying to be funny" cause i have a pretty odd sense of humor, and would NEVER make somehting like that
23:12  LordDragon: alexlea, i give him credit though. its easy to post hateful comments and pics anomymously on the internet. but it takes some balls to display that hateful stuff right outside your house for all to see
23:12  alexlea: LordDragon: or insnaity
23:13  alexlea: insanity*
23:13  LordDragon: alexlea, hehe. that too :P
23:13  alexlea: the noose is what does it for me, that takes it way too far
