09:32  Fenhl: hey, I have a question about server stuff
09:33  Fenhl: I want a domain to point to my Mac mini server, which is connected to a router
09:33  Fenhl: iiuc, I need a static IP to accomplish this
09:34  Fenhl: but won't that IP also point to the router, not the server?
09:35  Fenhl: and is there something like IP forwarding?
09:36  b0o-yeah: Fenhl: you mean your router also provides a local network hence private IP space ... a NAT ?
09:37  Fenhl: exactly
09:37  b0o-yeah: okay well you can use DynamicDNS 
09:37  b0o-yeah: to avoid having to pay for a static IP
09:37  Fenhl: yeah, I know that
09:37  b0o-yeah: and yes the IP will point to your router
09:38  b0o-yeah: but you can forward the ports that your server uses 
09:38  Fenhl: hm
09:38  Fenhl: that seems complicated
09:38  b0o-yeah: thus if anyone tried to access say your-hostname.org:80 it will send that communication to your server
09:38  b0o-yeah: as you will have forwarded that port
09:39  b0o-yeah: Fenhl: no its actually really easy
09:39  b0o-yeah: unless your router is really crappy
09:39  Fenhl: the process itself is easy, I know that
09:40  Fenhl: but I would have to constantly manage which ports are forwarded to the server
09:40  b0o-yeah: does your router not have a DMZ option?
09:41  b0o-yeah: although I personally am not a fan of DMZ
09:41  Fenhl: let me check that
09:41  b0o-yeah: I mean how many services is your server going to handle
09:41  b0o-yeah: and why would you need to constantly manage port forwarding 
09:42  b0o-yeah: if it is truly a problem you might need to pay for another IP address or consider remote hosting / colocation 
09:42  Fenhl: you have a point
09:42  Fenhl: it won't change too often
09:42  Fenhl: so I'll try the port forwarding method
09:45  b0o-yeah: thats a good idea... as a DMZ really opens your machine up to attacks on ports you are not trying to share otu
09:45  b0o-yeah: *out
09:45  Fenhl: I don't think my router even supports it
09:46  b0o-yeah: ah okay
09:49  fujisan: they call me san (//_-) emo san
09:50  b0o-yeah: err wtf fujisan, that just lit up my history window its soo bloody bright... and good nite btw
09:50  fujisan: huh sorry :(
09:50  fujisan: i dunno how to fix colloquy
09:51  b0o-yeah: umm with the Trash bin... apple makes it easy
09:51  fujisan: it's because we all use different client there is no computable compatibility  layer in OS X for IRC :( 
09:51  b0o-yeah: just drag and drop
09:51  fujisan: clients*
09:52  fujisan: can you show me in a screenshot how it lit up
09:52  fujisan: i will ask in colloquy support channel how to fix it
09:52  fujisan: b0o-yeah:  ?

09:53  fujisan: ty b0o-yeah 
09:54  Fenhl: so, I have a dynDNS account and domain now
09:55  Fenhl: and I have a domain at 1&1
09:55  Fenhl: I mean, account
09:55  b0o-yeah: Fenhl: I must get to bed... but hopefully someone else can help you :)
09:55  Fenhl: okay
09:56  Fenhl: good night
09:56  b0o-yeah: night :)
09:56  fujisan: night
09:56  fujisan: b0o-yeah: i posted the question
09:56  fujisan: i hope they'll reply 
09:56  Fenhl: Velociraptors!
09:56 * Fenhl hides
10:10  Fenhl: hmm
10:10  Fenhl: port forwarding does not seem to work
10:55  k-man: hi
10:55  crilly: hello
10:56  k-man: anyone know of a free password manager for mac, that does auto-type?
10:59  crilly: Well Firefox has a plugin that remembers and auto-types passwords for web-forms, but that's a major security risk. You can use the built in Key Chain to store passwords, but it won't auto-type them into forms or text fields for you.
11:00  k-man: yeah, i have been using keepass on windows and the auto type thing is very useful
11:01  crilly: I wouldn't use such an application because of the inherent security risks it presents, especially when you consider I am using a MBP (a portable and therefore losable device). This means I don't have experience using such applications, sadly. Sorry k-man.

13:27  topriddy: hello
13:27  topriddy: anyone got an advice for a cool image app that i just use to compress an image size? that is all
13:27  Fenhl: hi topriddy
13:29  topriddy: i could easily do this by re saving the file with lesser detail on photoshop running on windows, but right now all i got is a mac os x
13:32  bzinger: tropriddy: if you save in some lossy format, it will try to compress for you
13:35  topriddy: i did that already...it is currently in jpeg
13:35  topriddy: its scanned certificatesdocs
13:40  topriddy: done!
13:40  topriddy: still large though
13:40  bzinger: if its already in jpeg, it means its already compress, which means you can't compress more :( 
13:40  topriddy: would have to do...
13:40  topriddy: its scanned docs...i am reducing the quality now. 
13:41  topriddy: just a max of 100kb allowed
13:50  soahccc: Does somebody know a tool similar to md5summer on windows? I'd found checksum+ but it can't even recursively iterate through folders :(
13:53  jsoft: soahccc: perhaps md5 with find and xargs
13:54  soahccc: jsoft: Isn't there one more solution which is more complex than this one? :D
13:58  jsoft: ?
13:59  dnordstrom: Oh, I think I revert my filtering settings, no wonder I haven't seen anything here the past hour
14:00 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v marienz]
14:00  soahccc: jsoft: I could (but don't want to) code a simple comparing script but I search for a nice and intuitive gui :) I mean you solution is not very handy/maclike ;)
14:01  jsoft: Well I dont know what md5 summer does.
14:02  jsoft: If you want just a list of md5's of a folder, then; find . -type f -exec md5 {} +
14:02  jsoft: *shrug*
14:09  crilly: soahccc, what's the issue? What are you trying to achieve? 
14:12  soahccc: crilly: I'd like to compare whole folder structures on checksum base. md5summer creates md5-files which contains the hashes. Later you can recompare an folder with this file to see which files has changed...
14:12  soahccc: http://www.md5summer.org/images/summing.jpg
14:13  crilly: And I assume md5summer is a Windows only application, and you want an OS X solution?
14:19  soahccc: crilly: That's the point :) I could code a little script with do this in a more easier way but it would be a shell script too, I'd like to use a simple GUI... Weird that it is so hard to find such a tool... Many programmers are on mac or not?
14:21  crilly: Yeah, but it's if there is a need for such a thing. I've never needed to create an MD5 checksum in the 16 years I've been using a PC.
14:30  soahccc: crilly: Yeah but I've never needed an office program, cause I'm in another business :)
14:30  crilly: You're using an office program now - it's called a operating system.
14:31  soahccc: I mean microsoft office and co
14:31  soahccc: openoffice libreoffice ilife whatever
14:31  soahccc: I only needed plain text editors until now
14:38  crilly: soahccc, well if you can find library in C or Objective-C that can do MD5 hashes, if Cocoa doesn't contain something, then writing a simple UI app for OS X shouldn't be that hard.

15:47  zer0her0: yes he did
15:47  zer0her0: that bastard
15:48 @crilly: I hate iMovie.

16:17  zer0her0: don't mind me
16:42  jsoft: test
16:43  numberz: fail
16:44  pgpkeys: damn damn damn. i got Civilization V wineskinned for the Mac, and the fonts are all fucked up
16:44  pgpkeys: game runs but can't read the text cause most of its garbled
16:44  jsoft: Wineskinned?
16:44  jsoft: What is that exactly? 
16:44  pgpkeys: i own the PC version, its wrapped using wine so that it can be played on the mac
16:45  jsoft: Oh right.
16:45  jsoft: Surely you can just get the mac version... did you get it off of steam?
16:45  pgpkeys: love that game. i own the entire series hehe
16:45  jsoft: Or have to register it with steam?
16:45  pgpkeys: no i have the CDs
16:45  pgpkeys: nope
16:45  jsoft: :\
16:45  Necrosan: pgpkeys: Just play it in windows
16:45  pgpkeys: necrosan: means I gotta bootcamp or vmware fusion windows. was hoping not to
16:45  Necrosan: I mean, it's honestly worth a reboot to it. I found my playtimes averaging like 6-8 hours
16:46  pgpkeys: yeah mine too 
16:46  Necrosan: Heh.. it's worth it if you're going to be playing brand new games
16:46  Necrosan: like that
16:46  pgpkeys: hehe addictive little game :)
16:46  pgpkeys: well not so little but you get the point
16:46  Necrosan: I mean, I'm no windows fan, but it's nice having games "just work" =P
16:46  Necrosan: yeah
16:46  Necrosan: definitely
16:46  pgpkeys: true
16:46  pgpkeys: i dont play games often, but when i do heheh its usually a marathon session
16:47  jsoft: pgpkeys: you might be able to just use steam to play it. Enter it's registration code gizmo into steam, and then steam goes 'ahhh yes ok you bought the game' and you can download the files for the mac version.
16:47  zer0her0: isn't Civ V on the mac now?
16:47  pgpkeys: yeah
16:47  jsoft: Thats what I mean.
16:47 @crilly: it is??
16:48  pgpkeys: jsoft: no they only let you get the version your code is for
16:48 @crilly: I want to play Civ, but I thought they were all Windows only.
16:48  jsoft: I use steam for other games, and I see it right here in the list of games you can buy.
16:48  pgpkeys: crilly: nope
16:48  jsoft: pgpkeys: highly gaymax.
16:48  pgpkeys: yeah :/
16:48  Necrosan: its because a different vendor did the mac port
16:48  zer0her0: crilly: nope i believe both Civ 4 and Civ V are on Steam for mac now
16:48  jsoft: Whoa, its pretty expensive too
16:48  Necrosan: Two different games, technically
16:48 @crilly: zer0her0, nice
16:48  jsoft: $80 us
16:48  Necrosan: Funny how devs dont develop simultaneous releases
16:48  Necrosan: Similar to on console
16:48  zer0her0: what?!
16:49  jsoft: I know
16:49  Necrosan: Mac is just not worth developing games for =P
16:49  jsoft: eyg
16:49 @crilly: Not sure the graphics card in my MBP 13" will handle it, sadly.
16:49  Necrosan: definitely won't, crilly
16:49  pgpkeys: crilly: thats what i'm on and it works
16:49  Necrosan: With everything turned down =P
16:49  pgpkeys: in my case its just the fonts are screwed
16:49  zer0her0: 80 for what game?
16:49  pgpkeys: necrosan: nope
16:49  pgpkeys: zer0her0: Civ V
16:49  pgpkeys: mac version
16:50  Necrosan: pgpkeys: Strange, because it plays like shite on a geforce 9600
16:50  Necrosan: with dedicated vram
16:50  pgpkeys: well I dont have EVERY option maxed
16:50  Necrosan: ah
16:50  Necrosan: I'm just babied ;)
16:50  pgpkeys: I've 144MB dedicated VRAM but i've got most stuff set decently
16:50  pgpkeys: for civ you don't really need everything maxed out
16:51  pgpkeys: i know simcity 4 rush hour doens't play well
16:51  zer0her0: pgpkeys: um where are you looking?
16:51  pgpkeys: set the game to 1280x1024 and it bombed it completely
16:51  pgpkeys: zer0her0: *I* am not looking
16:51  zer0her0: civ v is cross platform and 50 bucks on steam
16:51 @crilly: To be honest, I like Urban Terror.
16:51 @crilly: Nice simple but fun game
16:51  pgpkeys: zer0her0: I would have to rebuy the game and get a mac versioned registration code
16:52  pgpkeys: mine is for the PC and won't allow me to play the mac version
16:52  zer0her0: steam play games are cross platform
16:52  zer0her0: i never buy games on cd anymore
16:52  zer0her0: so no clue about that
16:52 @crilly: It downloads the Mac/OS X compatible code doesn't it?
16:52  pgpkeys: crilly: nope. it keeps trying to give me the PC version
16:52  pgpkeys: leads me to believe that its the registration code doing the issuing
16:53 @crilly: ah
16:53 @crilly: Well I think we should all play Urban Terror because I said so.
16:53  pgpkeys: but it could be because I registered my PC version reg code cause i bought the game
16:53  pgpkeys: hehe i have urban terror 4.1 myself. remember?
16:53  pgpkeys: but not playing right now. i got like 420 podcasts coming in
16:54  pgpkeys: 417
16:54  pgpkeys: love how many FREE podcasts there are on itune store
16:54 @crilly: I wonder if a VPS, a $10/m one, could support a simple UT server for say, 8 players?
16:54  pgpkeys: its more a bw issue
16:55 @crilly: Indeed
16:55  pgpkeys: the vm would have no issue if you ran the dedicated server
16:56 @crilly: No I was planning on running a ray-tracing operation to render Avatar 2 3D.
16:56 @crilly: Of course I was going to run the dedicated server :P
16:56  zer0her0: crilly: i get dibs on watching it first
16:56  zer0her0: ...oh...
16:56  pgpkeys: crilly: why you giving me shit? you know what i eas meaning
16:57  pgpkeys: s/eas/was/
16:57 @crilly: well watch the language for one, and I was being sarcastic, and the ":P" means I'm being playful.
16:57  pgpkeys: the emphasis was on the part before the IF
16:58 @crilly: ok

18:01  webPragmatist: DOODS
18:01  MrUnagi: crilly: job paying for it?
18:01 @crilly: MrUnagi, the certs? I hope so. If they don't, I'll get a few basic ones my self and leave when I have a year's experience.
18:01  zer0her0: MrUnagi: then you should apply
18:01  zer0her0: it's fun
18:02  zer0her0: i enjoyed it
18:02  MrUnagi: army is paying for security+
18:02  MrUnagi: then i hope to get others after that
18:03 @crilly: I want LPIC3 and RHCE.
18:03  MrUnagi: i want mcse
18:03  MrUnagi: lmao
18:03 @crilly: Go for it. It's the only MS cert worth having.
18:04  MrUnagi: haha
18:04  MrUnagi: id rather go cisco route and avaya
18:04 @crilly: Yeah I want my CCNA next year too
18:04  MrUnagi: i have redcom knowledge but does anyone use redcom anymore
18:04  pgpkeys: I've my RHCE and I helped to develop the LPIC2, does that count? :)
18:04  MrUnagi: anyone work with ccm?
18:04 @crilly: Cool :)
18:05 @crilly: pgpkeys, I was going to move into Windows, but then this job came up and it's a UNIX/Linux job, so meh Linux it is
18:05  pgpkeys: that works
18:05  MrUnagi: crilly: what does the job entail
18:05 @crilly: Sys admin for thier *nix boxes and supporting their on-site end users (not many, about 20)
18:06  MrUnagi: ive worked with ubuntu, use to run it exclusively, am i qualified?
18:06  jsoft: Hmm, any suggestions on a vnc client which is not screen sharing?
18:06 @crilly: I'm hoping the job will be a good chance to study a lot.
18:06  jsoft: (screen sharing does not let a port be specified)
18:06  MrUnagi: jsoft: why do you not like screen sharing?
18:06  jsoft: ...
18:06 @crilly: MrUnagi, the funny thing is... yes.
18:06 @crilly: MrUnagi, because that's what got me this job ;)
18:06  MrUnagi: crilly: awesome!
18:06  MrUnagi: jsoft: serious question
18:06  MrUnagi: crilly: hahaha
18:06  MrUnagi: pay is good?
18:06  jsoft: I just said.
18:06  MrUnagi: jsoft: i must have missed it
18:06  MrUnagi: oh
18:06  MrUnagi: i see it
18:06 @crilly: MrUnagi, nah not really. it's entry level. it's equal to my current pay, so i'm happy :)
18:07 @crilly: for now.
18:07  MrUnagi: jsoft: yes it does
18:07  jsoft: MrUnagi: :/
18:07  MrUnagi: what
18:07  MrUnagi: localhot:port
18:07  MrUnagi: er loca....bah you know what i mean
18:07  jsoft: MrUnagi: vnc://host.com:1234 does not work. It still has a hard on for the default port
18:07  MrUnagi: vnc?
18:07  MrUnagi: host.com:1234
18:07  jsoft: Im runnit it from safari. How are you doing it?
18:08  MrUnagi: you are running screen sharing from safari?
18:08  jsoft: Yeah with vnc:// it launches screen sharing.
18:08  MrUnagi: really?
18:08  jsoft: Ya.
18:08  MrUnagi: hah i didnt know that
18:08  jsoft: But how do you do it manually anyhow?
18:08  jsoft: I did not find the actual app name or anything
18:08  jsoft: to launch it myself
18:09  MrUnagi: get safari to launch the app, then right click to keep it in the dock
18:09  MrUnagi: then launch it, and it asks for the host
18:09  MrUnagi: are you doing this over the net?
18:09  jsoft: Ya.
18:09  MrUnagi: you need to be doing it over ssh
18:09  jsoft: *sigh*
18:09  MrUnagi: what
18:09  jsoft: I thought vnc was already encrypted?
18:10  MrUnagi: hah
18:10  MrUnagi: no
18:10  jsoft: Or at least some decent versions of it
18:10  jsoft: How gay.
18:10  MrUnagi: it isnt hard
18:10  MrUnagi: open terminal
18:10  jsoft: Yeah I know the drill.
18:10  MrUnagi: ssh -C -L 5900:127.0.0.1:5900 user@host.com -p 1234
18:11  jsoft: But still, how do _you_ manually launch screen sharing?
18:11  MrUnagi: i just told you =/
18:11  jsoft: No, you just said safari.
18:11  jsoft: Which before now, you did not know launched it.
18:11  MrUnagi: launch it with safari, right click on the icon, options, keep in dock
18:12  jsoft: Ok I get that part, but you have obviously used it in the past. How did you launch it then?
18:12  MrUnagi: before using it over the net, i used it to access my server locally, so it was already kept in the dock
18:12  MrUnagi: to be honest i have no idea where it resides
18:12  jsoft: But where did you launch it from when you done that?
18:13  jsoft: Ie, I cant find any icons or anything anywhere
18:13  jsoft: And am just curious
18:13  MrUnagi: when you see other macs on the network, there is a button next to connect as
18:13  MrUnagi: says screen sharing
18:13  jsoft: Ahh right
18:13  jsoft: See, I knew that. :P
18:13  MrUnagi: yea it is odd that it seems to be a phantom app
18:13  MrUnagi: :D
18:13  MrUnagi: i personally dont use vnc over the net anyway
18:14  MrUnagi: but that is because when i can and do use it i aam on 3g so vnc isnt the best option
18:14  jsoft: Yeah. It's just acting as a KVM for a vps I have anyhow.
18:14  MrUnagi: vnc = sloooooow
18:14  MrUnagi: rdp isnt bad
18:14  MrUnagi: but usually 3rd party options are best
18:14  jsoft: Was just wanting to test it before I went to work on mah server.
18:15  MrUnagi: got it working yet?
18:17  jsoft: Ahh hah! /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing
18:17  MrUnagi: how did u find that
18:17  MrUnagi: google?
18:17  MrUnagi: lol
18:18  webPragmatist: i could ahve told you that
18:18  webPragmatist: have*
18:18  MrUnagi: but you didnt
18:18  MrUnagi: so no cookie
18:18  webPragmatist: because i was picking my nose
18:18  webPragmatist: http://screencast.com/t/T6v55zvY << uhhh i wouldn't trust this app to do my accounting
18:20  MrUnagi: why
18:20  webPragmatist: the amounts are like rounded differently
18:20  webPragmatist: which is just annoying
18:21  MrUnagi: i got 71.589375
18:21  MrUnagi: for the tax
18:21  MrUnagi: ah
18:21  MrUnagi: ok
18:21  MrUnagi: i got 861.787
18:22  MrUnagi: 861.82 is a little different than 861.787 lol
18:24  jsoft: Wow.
18:24  MrUnagi: mom
18:24  jsoft: It really is not easy to run screen sharing manually.
18:24  MrUnagi: i had no issues lol
18:24  MrUnagi: what kind of problems are you having
18:25  jsoft: it explodes
18:25  webPragmatist: MrUnagi: ya I think the idea is you are supposed to round the time with this rounding thing...
18:25  webPragmatist: i dunno
18:25  webPragmatist: it's just epically retarded...
18:25  MrUnagi: heh
18:25  MrUnagi: i just divided with 60
18:25  MrUnagi: 9.683
18:25  webPragmatist: no i mean.. what you do is in the prefs set a increment value
18:26  webPragmatist: so the second one is actually rounding to the nearest 15min
18:26  MrUnagi: blah
18:26  webPragmatist: but even that is sill… it should let you just round it manually.. or append a log entry that says "round up" or something
18:26  webPragmatist: atleast an explanation of why you are ripping the customer off
18:26  MrUnagi: or just calculate for the actual time lol
18:26  MrUnagi: or that lol
18:26  webPragmatist: right
18:27  MrUnagi: how hard is 85*9.683333333333 lol
18:27  webPragmatist: worst part is now i have to redo these logs with 1 min increments
18:27  webPragmatist: because you can't just recalculate a 'slip'
18:27  webPragmatist: once you change the increment it's like there foreer
18:27  webPragmatist: forever
18:28  MrUnagi: foreverrrr
18:30  jsoft: MrUnagi: I really just cant get the Screen Sharing app up in a way I can even put it into the dock, for a starters
18:30  MrUnagi: ::shrug:: i dunno man, just drag it from coreservices to the dock
18:36  jsoft: Well after all that dicking around I _still_ cant get it to use another port.
18:37  MrUnagi: do you get an error or something?
18:38  jsoft: It says it cant connect to host.name, but mentions nothing of the port I gave it.
18:38  MrUnagi: are you sure the port is open?
18:38  jsoft: Yep
18:39  MrUnagi: and you are trying this locally yes?
18:40  jsoft: Are you saying it wont alter the port unless it uses localhost?
18:40  jsoft: Because I am not trying to connect to a local machine, no.
18:40  MrUnagi: no i am trying to troubleshoot
18:40  webPragmatist: okay so...
18:40  webPragmatist: mail is retarded
18:41  MrUnagi: and the port is forwarded on the remote router to the server yes?
18:41  webPragmatist: it's a damn conspiracy
18:42  jsoft: MrUnagi: yeah its open to teh interwebs
18:42  jsoft: I can telnet to it from here.
18:42  jsoft: ie, the vnc port from here.
18:43  jsoft: And it goes 'Oh, hai. I see you are on a mac, you must be trying to use apples stubborn screen sharing vnc client to connect to this non-standard port. Good luck with that.'
18:43 * jsoft stabs screen sharing
18:43  MrUnagi: see i dont know i have been able to use any port i want
18:43  MrUnagi: but i choose to use 127.0.0.1:5900
18:55  sdad: does anyone know how to prevent an os x box from disconnecting from vpn when the screen is locked, it seems that this is the behavior that happens not only on actual os x computers, but iphones/ipads
19:02  yazdmich: Network is closed when it goes to sleep
19:03  Shadow__W: hey guys i sshed into my mac and when i try to cd into a mounted share i keep getting permission denied. What am i doing wrong
19:04  Shadow__W: i am able to access the share through finder but for some reason not through ssh
19:05  Shadow__W: nvm i got it. The permissions were set just for the user who mounted the share

20:14 @crilly: bashusr, zer0her0 - boo
20:14  zer0her0: ?!
20:14 @crilly: zer0her0, http://www.ircmac.com - new style. Just need to customise it :)
20:15  zer0her0: nice.
20:15  zer0her0: background needs customization 
20:16 @crilly: I like the colour. it'll require some work though.
20:16 @crilly: I'd like to use the default OS X background (the stars/nebula), but because of all the different screen resolutions out there -_-
20:18  zer0her0: well the color looks weird w/ the banner
20:18  Tsavo: how many people have a screen larger than 2560x1600?
20:18 * zer0her0 raises his hand
20:18  Tsavo: You're the exception then
20:18  zer0her0: i have 70000000x556456456457
20:19 @crilly: zer0her0, the banner at the top? that's the default - that is what needs customizing.
20:19  zer0her0: crilly: ah ok
20:19  zer0her0: :)
20:19 @crilly: I'm going to change it to a picture of me.
20:19 @crilly: Because that will attract users.
20:19  Tsavo: oh yah i'll be there every day 
20:19 @crilly: See?
20:21  Tsavo: You could have different resolutions of the Stars/Nebula background and use some php to determine which to use
20:21  Tsavo: http://midspin.webhop.net/screen.html
20:21  Tsavo: That right there tells you your resolution, but you could use the output to choose a size
20:21  Tsavo: or something
20:24  zer0her0: but i already have a wallpaper set as a picture of youd

21:25  erik1397: k so the 2 commands it gives in single user mode are: /sbin/fsck -fy, and /sbin/mout -uw /
21:25  zer0her0: torchie: ?
21:25  torchie: can you sideload books to the kindle
21:25  mr2k: Hello everyone! My friend is having some trouble connecting his camera to his mac via USB. The camera is a Nikon DSLR. The mac won't recognize the camera. My PC recognizes it just fine. Can anyone help? :)
21:25  zer0her0: snL20: awe someone failed out of art class
21:25  erik1397: with the first command, there are a couple of notable things, like: incorrect number of thread records (4, 232)
21:25  zer0her0: torchie: the kindle device or kindle software?
21:25  snL20: zer0her0: they all do
21:25  snL20: =D
21:25  torchie: kindle device
21:26  zer0her0: kindle shows up as a flash drive when you plug it in
21:26  snL20: zer0her0: the problem is they dont give up
21:26  torchie: oh ok
21:26  zer0her0: load supported files and it shows up
21:26  erik1397: and invalid volume free block count (it should be 4332249 instead of 4332236)
21:26  Pula: dimm: nothing? are you taken to the download page?
21:26  torchie: so epubs and txts and pdfs and such?
21:26  zer0her0: epubs no
21:26  zer0her0: pdfs eh
21:26  zer0her0: txts are fine
21:26  erik1397: then it says I/O error and I/O timeout
21:26  zer0her0: read the supported list dude
21:26  erik1397: and then bus error
21:27  zer0her0: erik1397: sounds like HDD starting to fail
21:27  snL20: zer0her0: the clue should be not to take the art class in the first place
21:27  snL20: =D
21:27  erik1397: when i tried /sbin/mount -uw /, it hangs on 'disk0s3: I/O timeout'
21:27  zer0her0: snL20: not sure what you're saying
21:27  erik1397: yea, doesnt look good...
21:27  zer0her0: erik1397: you have multiple partitions?
21:27  snL20: zer0her0: that's the problem
21:27  torchie: no epub on kindle waaaa
21:27  snL20: :D
21:28  zer0her0: torchie: nope :( i keep emailing them
21:28  zer0her0: but i doubt it will happen
21:28  zer0her0: want epub get any other ereader out there
21:28  zer0her0: snL20: sure buddy whatever you say
21:28  torchie: I'm frustrated because I don't know what format this gutenberg torrent is in
21:28  torchie: but it's a good thing I got a nook color!

21:28  snL20: zer0her0: I never said I was your buddy
21:28  erik1397: hmm i am not sure actually, this is my friends comp so im just checking it for him, but i havent checked yet if there are multiple partitions
21:28  zer0her0: torchie: i had a NC i returned it
21:28  torchie: why
21:29  torchie: I'm getting really hype for this thing
21:29  zer0her0: it would randomly not read epubs that it had read fine before
21:29  LzrdKing: bye all, i'm starting my winter vacation so i'll see you all next year!
21:29  dimm: Pula: yes, on the doenlaod page i can see server for linux, windows, and solaris
21:29  zer0her0: it wouldn't load cover art
21:29  mr2k: No one? :/
21:30  zer0her0: mr2k: maybe alittle more info like what kind of camera, what version software, so on.
21:31  torchie: oh that sounds like a pain
21:31  torchie: hope it doesnt happen to me
21:31  mr2k: Sorry. Nikon DSLR D3S, OSX Leopard 10.6.5.
21:31  torchie: although right now my library is nothing but PDF which may be a pain
21:31  torchie: apparently there's no bookmarking in pdf
21:31  zer0her0: mr2k: and what software to load the photos?
21:32  zer0her0: torchie: oh yea and i couldn't get past the first page on any of my PDFs
21:32  torchie: dang
21:32  zer0her0: the hardware was beautiful, on par w/ Apple
21:32  torchie: hopefully that was just a bad egg
21:32  mr2k: zer0her0: The problem is that he can't load the photos because OSX won't recognize the camera.
21:32  zer0her0: but software bleh
21:32  torchie: because I'm ridiculously hype to get all up into this thing
21:32  zer0her0: naw just bad software
21:32  snL20: mr2k: no drivers ?
21:32  zer0her0: mr2k: did you try to open iPhoto, or Aperture or Lightroom?
21:33  zer0her0: it shouldn't need drivers
21:34  snL20: depends if it does usb msc you would be alright
