19:12  crilly: I guess MS Office is the best bet if you want to stay completely compatible with everyone else.
19:13  eagles0513875: CEnTR4L: what version
19:13  CEnTR4L: 2011.
19:13  eagles0513875: might go buy myself and sis a copy

19:14  CEnTR4L: I wouldn't do that right away eagle, you might want to download and install a trail to see for yourself first.
19:15  eagles0513875: lol wont comment on another way to get it lol
19:15 * eagles0513875 zips lips
19:17  CEnTR4L: I hate the big-wide pane though... taking too much size of the application and confusing too.
19:17  CEnTR4L: Just like MS Word 2007 for Windoze.

20:56  DoFoT9: usb3.0 not coming to macs for a while
21:00  Branes: If ever.
21:00  DoFoT9: haha
21:00  DoFoT9: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-was-granted-a-patent.ars
21:00  DoFoT9: esata can do target disk mode
21:01  DoFoT9: so i guess they may change to that
21:01  Branes: They're still keen on Lightpeak, we'll see that before USB3
21:02 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
21:06  DoFoT9: thats true. id agree with that. i still think they will want to put it in the "lead" machines first though - i.e. mac pros
21:06  DoFoT9: then work it down through the others
21:10  crilly: Branes: Lightpeak is better anyway
21:10  crilly: Much, much faster.
21:13  Angostura: Does LightPeak provide power though - have they decided that?
21:14  YawningAngel: OK, noob question
21:14  YawningAngel: How do I boot from a CD or DVD?
21:14  YawningAngel: It just goes straight in to the OS on a normal boot
21:15  crilly: Angostura: 
21:15  crilly: "The major uncertainty in Light Peak is what type of power interface it supports, if any. Originally, "Intel said it's working on bundling the optical fiber with copper wire so Light Peak can be used to power devices plugged into the PC"[7]"
21:15  LSD`: YawningAngel: hold down C as you power on the machine
21:15  crilly: Angostura: I don't think it does.
21:15  YawningAngel: Ah thanks
21:17  YawningAngel_: LSD`: Thanks
21:17  YawningAngel_: I was completely stumped and in a very awkward situation
21:18  crilly: YawningAngel__: are you in Croyden?
21:18  YawningAngel_: No
21:18  YawningAngel_: My ISP is though
21:19  crilly: Yeah I'm with Virgin too
21:19  crilly: I use a VPN though, to bounce through an IP in Manchester.
21:19  YawningAngel_: I don't care enough
21:19  YawningAngel_: Not doing too much illegal :p
21:19  Angostura:  A more general solution YawningAngel - hold down alt at boot presents you with a list of bootable volumes to choose from
21:19  Angostura: Bloody Virgin Media
21:20  crilly: Nah I'm not, but I'm sick of all this "ISPs are spying on you!!!!ooooohhhh!!!" so I just VPN my traffic. End of discussion.
21:20  YawningAngel_: I'll take my chances, not got much to hide
21:20  YawningAngel_: Anyway, at least I've managed to fix the hash I made of bootcamp
21:20  Tomis: they're still loging your traffic either way crilly 
21:21  crilly: After installing Windows via Bootcamp, are you meant to be presented with a menu on bootup?
21:21  crilly: Tomis: Can't see it though.
21:21  Tomis: hold option for boot menu
21:21  Tomis: otherwise it boots into you default choice
21:21  crilly: hmm OK.
21:22  YawningAngel_: crilly: I installed 7 by bootcamp and it failed totally
21:22  Tomis: you can change that via Startup Disk control panel / pref pane
21:22  YawningAngel_: Probably because I failed and used incompatible hardware
21:22  crilly: I might Bootcamp Vista so I can run this Cisco DVD.
21:22  YawningAngel_: Use virtualbox
21:22  YawningAngel_: Way easier
21:22  Tomis: why bootcamp when you can VM i say
21:22  crilly: Yeah I suppose so.
21:23  iaj: when I see someone (in network) in my finder - is there some way to find out its ipadress?
21:23 * crilly downloads VB
21:23  YawningAngel: iaj: check FreeBSD console commands and try them
21:24  YawningAngel: alternatively, if you want the external Ip
21:24  YawningAngel: Just get your own
21:24  YawningAngel: If you share a connection, it should be the same
21:24  crilly: brb need to switch from wireless to wired
21:36  crilly: Installing Vista in a VM now.
21:44  Angostura: crilly: I thought I noticed the lights dim
21:54  crilly: Angostura: ;)
21:54  crilly: I only need it for my CCNA DVDs. They contain example tests etc
21:54  crilly: but it's inside Windows software.

22:19  ionas: ChrisAM, thank you again for redirecting me to Nicecast
22:19  ionas: ChrisAM, with LittleSnitch its one of those missing mac os x core features :)
22:19  ionas: And maybe clipper ;)
22:22  crilly: :)
22:22  crilly: LittleSnitch is nice. I don't use it though.
22:23  aL3x: little snitch annoys me
22:24  crilly: aL3x: Yeah, mainly one of the reasons I purged it.
22:25  aL3x: alot of what it does can be done manually btw
22:30  crilly: aL3x: Oh? What through iptables or something?
22:31  aL3x: crilly: i'm not 100% sure, but i have done it in the past for some software so it wouldn't call home
22:31  crilly: Oh I see.

22:48  crilly: Can I kill the MobileMe icon from my menu bar?
22:50  remyo: crilly: Hold down command and drag it off 
22:55  crilly: wtf!!
22:55  crilly: How come I've never been told that before!lmao
22:55  crilly: remyo: genuis
22:55  remyo: crilly: No problem 
22:56  remyo: It works with just about any of the apple menu-bar icons. Applescripts, Volume, WiFi, etc
22:57  remyo: However not with third party ones.
23:03  crilly: remyo: yes indeed. I've dragged a few Apple ones off; TimeMachine, MobileMe, Volume and WiFi. I can configure the volume through my keyboard, and the WiFi through system preferences on that rare occasion my MBP leaves the house.
23:04  remyo: The only one I've removed is time. As I think it's counterproductive to always be watching it
23:05  remyo: But you've got a good point about volume, crilly 
23:06  crilly: I can understand people needing the WiFi one though, especially if their machine moves a lot. Mine just doesn't, so it's wasting space.
23:09 --- MobGod is now known as Mob|Away
23:11  crilly: remyo: How do you add them again, out of interest? I've chucked the battery life one off as well. It's never unplugged long enough to worry about.
23:11  ionas: LittleSnitch is awesome - its the must have tool to buy imho - privacy * >
23:11  ionas: > *
23:11  remyo: crilly: System Prefs > Network > Show AirPort status in menubar 
23:12  crilly: ionas: OS X has a firewall already, and I gave a router with NAT to block crap too.
23:12  remyo: crilly: Most of them are re-enabled in their System Pref sections.
23:14  crilly: remyo: Ah OK.
23:21  Branes: I'm with the rest of the guys (and Alex) re LittleSnitch ... it's more annoying than useful, reminds me too much of the Windows we all escaped from, and is really only useful for the ultra-paranoid or the obsessive-compulsives :)
23:22  Branes: I bought a licence for it not long after it came out ... but after having it on the machine for three months, I removed it ... and that was two years ago.
23:24  remyo: Branes: Why'd you get a licence in the first place?
23:24  aL3x: i think perhaps branes had temporary insanity
23:24  aL3x: :)
23:24  Branes: Alex, I've never been sane -- normal is what happens to other people :)
23:25  aL3x: temporary normalacy then?
23:26  Branes: remyo, it was on special, I thought it'd be a nice addition ... it nagged incessantly about the littlest of things, but once house-broken I hardly knew it was there, until it fell over and lost all connectivity. Annoying when it's a headless Mac and some software kills the ethernet port.
23:26  crilly: Because he pays for stuff that requires it, like everyone should.
23:26  aL3x: crilly: i dont think taht iswhat remyo meant, he didnt mean buy it as opposed to pirate it, he meant why buy it at all
23:26  remyo: crilly: I'm all for paying for software. Just wondered about THAT one
23:27  Branes: I pay (or somehoe recompense) anyone who has improved the way I do things or added to my enjoyment. I pay for freeware, if I use it a lot :)
23:27  remyo: Me too
23:27  aL3x: crilly: might wanna be careful about sssuming things...give people the benefit of the doubt :)
23:28  teolicy: Hi. Can someone recommend an strace/truss replacement for OSX 10.6 which doesn't suck? (hint: dtruss sucks :)
23:28  aL3x: assuming8
23:28  aL3x: *
23:28  aL3x: teolicy: no, i cannot because i have no clue what you are tlaking about
23:28  remyo: teolicy: dtrace? 
23:28  remyo: Is that what you're asking
23:29  teolicy: remyo: I acknowledge dtrace's superiority, it's just so cumbersome to use if you're not Brian Cantryll :)
23:29  crilly: aL3x: I don't need to be careful about anything. If you're offended: /part
23:29  aL3x: crilly: why are you getting an attitude with me? i wasn't with you
23:29  remyo: teolicy: I'd never heard of strace. Thought you'd made a typo :P
23:30  teolicy: remyo: It's the 'truss' equivalent on Linux. Why did they take truss from os when they switched from Tiger to Leopard? 
23:30  remyo: teolicy: I have no clue 
23:31  aL3x: remyo: do you have me on ignore again...just curious because i really dont wanna defend you anymore, or attempt to talk at you if that is teh case
23:31  remyo: teolicy: Check out ktrace
23:31  remyo: aL3x: No, i don't
23:32  teolicy: remyo: I don't have it on my OSX 10.6.
23:33  aL3x: ok remyo, thanks for telling me
23:33  remyo: aL3x: I kind of unignored everyone I was ignoring because it seemed like it was causing a lot of issues
23:34  aL3x: that whole channel is having issues
23:35  aL3x: though you are friends with those people, so you might see it differently
23:35 * remyo gets all defensive 
23:35  remyo: What do you mean "Those people"
23:35  remyo: :P
23:36  aL3x: you know the people i mean, and i said it that way so i am not publicly saying things about them
23:36  ChrisAM: I don't like any of you.
23:37  aL3x: i got banned for nothing last night...i was provoked to ask why in the ban message, but i ignored it...imo that channel has gonecrazy
23:37  remyo: I wanna be friends with everyone. It's just hard sometimes. Especially when everyone seems to be choosing sides 
23:38  remyo: I'd like to, if at all possible, to use irc free of drama
23:38  aL3x: remyo: here is my take on it. That channel has people with personal grudges and favortism...which i think is not right since its using an official # beginning....as for sides, everyone will have sides...but it shouldnt be mixed in with teh administration
23:39  ChrisAM: This is ##mac, not #mac
23:39  aL3x: ChrisAM: i am not talking about this chanel
23:39  ChrisAM: oh
23:39  ChrisAM: we love everyone here.
23:39  aL3x: obviously i am not banned form here since i am here
23:39  aL3x: :D
23:39  nicoAMG: ChrisAM, Whats the difference?
23:39  aL3x: what are the rules of this channel? the only time i remeber getting kicked form here was form using a bad word
23:40  ChrisAM: nicoAMG ... #channels are associated with an official project, ##channels are not.
23:40  nicoAMG: ChrisAM, is my first time here
23:40  nicoAMG: o.k
23:41  aL3x: my problems began in the "other" channel when i defended an injustice against anothe rmember....after 3 years i didnt expect that channel to be the kind to ban the defenders of banned people
23:41  aL3x: then after that i got nitpicked for every little thing...
23:41  ChrisAM: nicoAMG ... it's a freenode thing: http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#channelnaming
23:41  nicoAMG: The Hackintosh noise is so loud i see
23:42  fleebailey33: ChrisAM: hi
23:42  ChrisAM: fleebailey33 ... hi
23:42  fleebailey33: i got my series liscenses, and officially starting with prudential
23:42  ChrisAM: what license?
23:42  fleebailey33: 6 and 63 for now
23:42  ChrisAM: I don't know what that means.
23:42  fleebailey33: got my life and health as well
23:43  fleebailey33: securities liscense
23:43  ChrisAM: oh
23:43  fleebailey33: SEC/finra
23:43  ChrisAM: congrats
23:43  diffract|: does anyone know how i can make chrome show pdf files inside the browser?
23:45  maxsz: diffract|: install the latest beta
23:45  nicoAMG: i'm lookig for some help to upgrade an old PM G5 Tower from 10.4 to 10.5. is the stock 10.5 bundled with other Mac useful for the job?
23:45  diffract|: maxsz: is there another way?
23:46  maxsz: diffract|: dunno
23:46  nicoAMG: ChrisAM, yeah, Thanks!
23:46  mynameisdeleted: I wish I coudl send photos directly to my iphone via wifi or bluetooth direct without a full sync like I can with my android or anythign else
23:46  mynameisdeleted: I dont like doing a full iphoen sync every time I want to copy one picture and having to change my folder and move photos to do so
23:47  fleebailey33: mynameisdeleted: diskaid
23:47  matthias-: Hmm, is there any # about psp ?
23:47  matthias-: or maybe someone here is using psp go ?
23:47  diffract|: well this seemed to work https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nnbmlagghjjcbdhgmkedmbmedengocbn?hl=en
23:53  crilly: mynameisdeleted: You don't have to do a full iPhone sync.
23:54  crilly: mynameisdeleted: Load up iPhoto, plug your iPhone in and it'll pick it up and show you the pictures on it; select what you want and import them.
23:54  Branes: nicoAMG: You can't use the OSX installer discs that came with another Mac on the G5.
23:55  Branes: nicoAMG: Grey-labeled discs are machine specific ... on top of that, if the discs came with an Intel based Mac, they're of absolutely no use for a PowerPC machine. You will need to find a retail boxed copy of the 10.5 installer.
