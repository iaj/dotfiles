00:03  gl0ria: how do i go about fully unloading the bluetooth module?
00:07  b0o-yeah: gl0ria: I wanted to do the same thing but I think other services depend on some of the underlying stuff
00:07  fujisan: b0o-yeah:  :O glory glory hallelujah
00:08  b0o-yeah: fujisan: ?  :)
00:08  fujisan: hehe just saying hi myway
00:08  b0o-yeah: ah very nice
00:08  fujisan: otherwise i cant have people play that song during my funeral :-x
00:09  gl0ria: ~ > sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOBluetoothFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/BroadcomUSBBluetoothHCIController.kext
00:09  gl0ria: ~ > 
00:09  gl0ria: there
00:09  gl0ria: ~ > sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOBluetoothFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBBluetoothHCIController.kext
00:10  gl0ria: then kextload to reload them
00:10  gl0ria: :)
00:10  b0o-yeah: gl0ria: it doesn't break anything else?
00:11  gl0ria: i dont see anything broken
00:11  b0o-yeah: okay cool then

00:22  kimbo1986: Anyone know exactly what kind of drives are in the MacBook pro? I have mid2009 Mac with tiny 168gb 5400 rpm drive and I want to go possibly 500gb 7200rpm but I can not have a noisy drive due to audio recording.  Any input?
00:25  S_SubZero: they are 2.5" drives.
00:26  mcav13: salut
00:27  mcav13: you ou
00:28  Velociraptors: kimbo1986: from memory they're 9mm too - 12mm ones don't fit (may be worth verifying that elsewhere too)
00:30  fujisan: How can i find it out which apps i launced at a certain date?
00:30  fujisan: launched*
00:30  kimbo1986: I know what type of drive 2.5 ata 
00:30  kimbo1986: But how are they so silent
00:31  kimbo1986: Are they mounted with rubber mounts?
00:31  kimbo1986: Never looked in there
00:31  kimbo1986: 9mm? I never seen that specification.  Is that the width?
00:36  b0o-yeah: kimbo1986: width or height yes
00:36  b0o-yeah: the 12mm ones do fit in the newer pros
00:37  b0o-yeah: the unibodies that is
00:37  b0o-yeah: I consider it the height because the drive is usually laying flat
00:39  b0o-yeah: I think its actually 9.5mm?  at least thats the standard iirc
00:40  b0o-yeah: kimbo1986: although the HDD don't tend to be all that noisy in laptops, I find the fans to be far more noisy 
00:41  S_SubZero: SSD
00:41  b0o-yeah: sure if you have $$ or can deal with small size and perhaps a 2nd disk in the opti bay
00:47  Velociraptors: kimbo1986:  what size macbook pro is it?

00:56  paissad: guys, i did 
00:56  paissad: sudo mount -t nfs nfs://192.168.1.7/media/sharing-server /media/sharing-macbook 
00:56  paissad: but i get this error mount_nfs: can't get net id for host
00:56  paissad: when i try using the diskUtility.app, it crashes !
00:57  paissad: that's why i tried from command line !
00:58  paissad: my host is correct, 
00:58  paissad: telnet 192.168.1.7 2049 (nfs port) is ok
00:58  paissad: the ip of my macbook is in the /etc/hosts of my server, and in /etc/exports ....
00:58 @ChrisAM: I'm not very experienced with NFS... sorry.
00:59  paissad: no problem mate
01:00  b0o-yeah: paissad: are the groupid and userid numbers correct?
01:01  b0o-yeah: like I used to mount an nfs share with my mac that was being served from my fedora box
01:01  b0o-yeah: but I had to make sure the groupid and such matched 
01:02  b0o-yeah: and linux starts at like 500 and os x starts at 501 iirc 
01:02  paissad: b0o-yeah, you're right
01:03  paissad: but  i thought that user id or group id had no importance 
01:03  paissad: no ?
01:03  b0o-yeah: err I think it does as thats how nfs authenticates as it assumes the same user 
01:04 --- Angostura_ is now known as Angostura
01:04  b0o-yeah: it checks this based on groupid or userid maybe both 
01:04  b0o-yeah: I haven't played with it for awhile 
01:05  paissad: ok
01:06  b0o-yeah: it took me awhile to get it working
01:06  b0o-yeah: also in my case I had to tell it to work on non standard ports
01:07  b0o-yeah: as it kept getting blocked by my firewall in fedora 
01:07  b0o-yeah: but its nice and fast :)
01:07  b0o-yeah: although not secure so unless you are tunneling it, I only suggest using it locally 
01:08  b0o-yeah: also I think by default it doesn't use safe async writes iirc, thus making sure the connection isn't randomly severed is a good idea 
01:09  b0o-yeah: as nfs is old school so it treats it like a disk that is actually part of the system and not a network volume

03:04  derp: Tomis, how do i access it on XP?
03:05 +Tomis: just as you would with any other file share

03:07  derp: ty
03:07  derp: <3
03:11  mezod: hi, i just created a .exe in win7 and i would like to know if it can be executed in Mac, or does mac have a commandline like windows, where you can run the .exe?
03:12  derp: mezod, well, with Parallels you can.
03:12  derp: natively, no.
03:12  cryptic0: I am noticing that my screen resolution gets blurry for a second after switching to a different space.  Has anyone else noticed this?
03:13  derp: what flavor of OS X you in?
03:13  mezod: what is Parallels? if i have a .cpp on mac which would be the easieast way to execute it?
03:13  derp: mezod, it's a virtualization software
03:14  S_SubZero: mezod: are you familiar with virtualization at all
03:14  derp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac
03:14  derp: It's not free
03:14  derp: but it's very good
03:14  S_SubZero: this doesn't answer your question in the way you expected, I think
03:14  derp: If you want free, virtualbox
03:14  mezod: my problem is that i coded something in c++ and someone in a mac wants to execute it but i have no idea how can he execute it there
03:15  b0o-yeah: mezod: they need to compile it first
03:15  mezod: i expected so, but i guess they'll need the "mingw" for mac or something hehe
03:16  b0o-yeah: is it just a cmd line program?
03:16  mezod: yes
03:16  b0o-yeah: umm they probably can just open a terminal and type ....
03:17  S_SubZero: if you designed your app to be very "for Windows" then it will be a pain to migrate over.  The better cross-platform apps I've seen tend to be very OS neutral to begin with.
03:17  b0o-yeah: c++ yourfile.cpp -o somename
03:17  b0o-yeah: and then ./somename
03:17  b0o-yeah: assuming your not using any win specific headers
03:17  b0o-yeah: you might need to modify it slightly
03:18  mezod: i'm not
03:18  b0o-yeah: you can even skip the naming and just c++ yourfile.cpp
03:18  b0o-yeah: and then they can just ./a.out
03:18  mezod: does that person need to install something?
03:18  mezod: i mean before, or mac already comes with c++
03:19  b0o-yeah: maybe the dev tools that come on the OS dvd
03:19  mezod: hmm ok thank you very much :)
03:19  mezod: a.out is like the default name?
03:19  b0o-yeah: yeah
03:20  mezod: and to the "c++ yourfile.cpp -o somename" does somename need an extention?
03:20  mezod: like .exe or something
03:20  b0o-yeah: no
03:20  mezod: ok
03:21  mezod: b0o-yeah thanks again :)
03:22  b0o-yeah: mezod: sure no problem :)
03:22  b0o-yeah: feel free to ask more if you get stuck ... although I am rusty on my c++ coding ;)
03:27  mezod: b0o-yeah the problem is that i can't test it :/ is for another person, but if it didnt work i will appear around here tomorrow hehe
03:27  mezod: i should get a mac soon anyways...great for designing purposes :P
03:27  b0o-yeah: now your talking :)
03:27  b0o-yeah: you should indeed get a mac
03:28  b0o-yeah: mezod: btw you can run OS X under windows, but with Parallels you can run windows on a mac very easily 
03:29  b0o-yeah: *can't
03:29  b0o-yeah: err scratch all that 
03:29  b0o-yeah: I will try again
03:29  mezod: yes i am not really a fan of virtualboxes
03:29  b0o-yeah: mezod: btw you cannot run OS X on a pc ... but you can run windows on a mac via virtualization or bootcamp 
03:30  b0o-yeah: :)
03:30  diffract|: anyone played minecraft?
03:32  Roasted: pretty sure my hard drive is dead, but since macs are awesome and I cant boot any normal cds on it like gparted or a linux cd I have no idea of verifying this. any ideas?
03:33  diffract|: take it out, connect it to another computer
03:33  diffract|: see if it can read it
03:33  Roasted: :/
03:33  fwaokda: is there a function key that isn't used on the mac? I'm hoping to bind it to something
03:33  mezod: b0o-yeah i see :P i just realized that person might have no idea on how to access folder on commandline, does "cd" work for mac?
03:33  diffract|: fwaokda: you can always unbind the function key you don't use
03:34  fwaokda: diffract|, where do i do that?
03:34  fwaokda: for instance f12
03:34  b0o-yeah: mezod: yep
03:34  diffract|: fwaokda: go to system preferences and type keyboard in the search field
03:34  Roasted: unbind a key? you can customize that in mac? 
03:34  diffract|: fwaokda: it's keyboard shotcuts
03:34  b0o-yeah: mezod: you familiar with linux? as by default the mac terminal uses bash 
03:34  mezod: yes
03:35  mezod: great then
03:35  b0o-yeah: indeed 
03:35  Roasted: linux <3
03:35  cryptic0: what is the time frame on logic board replacements in mbps?
03:36  b0o-yeah: mezod: it sounds like the person you are giving the program to is very much a enduser and not a programmer 
03:37  mezod: b0o-yeah it is a teacher in literature, i just did a "wannabe" piece of art that mixes c++ and literature, and he is on mac :P
03:37  b0o-yeah: mezod: if your program is indeed very simple you can probably just compile it under linux and send them the executable assuming they have an intel mac
03:38  b0o-yeah: mezod: oh no ;)
03:38  b0o-yeah: literature and c++ hehe
03:38  mezod: the problem is that at the moment i am not in a linux, because win7 killed my debian in the installation...and i have been too lazy to seek to reinstall everything :p
03:38  b0o-yeah: I know someone that did a recursive assembly program which prints its own code as an art project 
03:39  mezod: yes is always nice to try weird stuff hehe
03:39  b0o-yeah: I mean you can probably compile it under windows for os x with the correct gnu tools but I don't know how
03:39  mezod: ah mine is simpler, hehe, that sounds tough
03:39  diffract|: i don't think a linux executable would work on osx
03:40  b0o-yeah: diffract|: I have done it
03:40  mezod: if he doesnt manage to run it i will go there with my laptop, its just he seems to want to learn a little bit
03:40  b0o-yeah: diffract|: but I am not saying its a good practice but it can work for like hello world
03:40  b0o-yeah: but I think it probably shouldn't be done
03:41  b0o-yeah: mezod: if you want to send me your source ... assuming I can understand the code I can compile it for you
03:42  b0o-yeah: well I don't expect you to trust me but I can at least see if it compiles without errors
03:42  b0o-yeah: and if I can't follow your code there is no way I will execute it ;)
03:43  b0o-yeah: oh I missed the "he wants to learn a little bit"
03:44  mezod: hehe i think he will manage to run it
03:45  b0o-yeah: diffract|: actually you might be right ... my memory is pretty bad so don't hold me to it okay :)
03:48  mezod: the code is quite unreadable anyway ...the story is explained thorugh the comments and i use variables and stuff as part of the story :p
03:48  mezod: i should be off now...almost 4am :P
03:48  assmonger: hey guys
03:48  assmonger: do you know if it's possible to open a terminal tab and run a command -- from the commandline?
03:49  b0o-yeah: assmonger: the terminal does have tabs
03:50  assmonger: yeah, i mean, can i start a tab from the command line
03:50  b0o-yeah: oh I doubt it
03:50  assmonger: that would be sick
03:50  b0o-yeah: you can command+t
03:50 +Tomis: doesn't make sense assmonger 
03:50  assmonger: Tomis: why?
03:50 +Tomis: command line has no GUI
03:50 +Tomis: how would it open a new tab
03:50  assmonger: huh?
03:51  mezod: b0o-yeah once again thanks and good night!
03:51  assmonger: xterm is aware of the terminal
03:51  b0o-yeah: mezod: cya 
03:51 +Tomis: you could script the terminal using applescript
03:51 +Tomis: or just run your command faceless, no need for the terminal really unless you want to see it processing
03:51  assmonger: yeah true
04:21  Roasted: WOW I didnt know taking apart an ibook would be so ridiculous
04:25  Necrosan: yeah man

04:41  mijk: ?
04:41  CPng|N: they won't
04:43  Roasted: too bad they do
04:43  Roasted: more often than they should imo
04:50 +Tomis: 5 years old, that's an eternity in computing Roasted 
04:52  Roasted: that's not what my point was
04:52  Roasted: I wasn't mad at the fact I have a hardware failure. I'm mad at the fact apple designed them as if they WOULDNT EVER have a hardware failure.
04:52  Roasted: Apple is so silly.
04:57  Kimbo1986: Hey im about to order a 500gb momentus XT
04:57  Kimbo1986: for my MBP
04:57  Kimbo1986: anyone suggest otherwise>
04:57  Kimbo1986: ?
04:57  Necrosan: no
04:57  Necrosan: good disk
04:57  torchie: not WD huh
04:57  Necrosan: That's the one with the SSD?
04:57  Kimbo1986: yea
04:57  Kimbo1986: hybrid
04:58  Necrosan: very good disk
04:58  Necrosan: you'll love it like you love your hearts ability to pump blood
04:58  Kimbo1986: WD makes hybrid?
04:58  Necrosan: WD sux
04:58  Kimbo1986: Yea im excited
04:58  Necrosan: stick with a known winner; seagate.
04:58  Kimbo1986: the ONLY thing im worried about is noise
04:58  Necrosan: they aren't loud at all
04:58  Kimbo1986: well, I know there not LOUD
04:58  Kimbo1986: but
04:58  Kimbo1986: right now mine is silent, and I NEED silence
04:58  Kimbo1986: i use it for audio recording
04:59  Necrosan: yeah, I use a disk without the SSD stuff during audio recording successfully
04:59  Necrosan: I think you will be fine.
04:59  Kimbo1986: but i guess if it is a little too much vibration, I can rig it with some rubber 
04:59  Kimbo1986: somehow
04:59  Kimbo1986: will wait till i get to that point
05:00  Roasted: -1 to seagate
05:00  Roasted: have had 3 failures in 2 years on brand new drives
05:01  Roasted: ask me about my samsung or WD drives though.....
05:02  Kimbo1986: Is there any comparable non seagate drives?
05:03  Kimbo1986: Im getting it for $99
05:04  Roasted: for a laptop?
05:05  Kimbo1986: yea
05:06  Kimbo1986: I hope?

05:06 +Tomis: i don't even hear it
05:06  Roasted: meh
05:06 +Tomis: the fans make more noise
05:06  Roasted: I've had enough seagate failures that I will avoid them at all costs in the future
05:06  Roasted: just my opinion though
05:06  Roasted: in fact
05:06  Roasted: I have a seagate out rigth now for warranty
05:06  Roasted: it's been about 3 weeks...
05:08 +Tomis: people actually use the manufactuer's warranties?
05:08  Roasted: I do
05:08  Roasted: its the third fricken time it died
05:08  Roasted: you bet it's on their dime
05:08  Roasted: besides, it's one of my 3 backup drives. it hardly puts me out of commission :P

05:10  Roasted: its a klaptop hard drive
05:10  Roasted: why wouldnt it work
05:11  Kimbo1986: Someone mentioned to me something abou 12mm
05:11  b0o-yeah: ah the hybrid
05:11  Roasted: 12mm what
05:11  Kimbo1986: or 17mm <-- what is all of that
05:11  Kimbo1986: i have no clue
05:11  Roasted: does the mac have something stupid about it that would prevent you from using standard hardware?
05:11  fujisan: the mac wants intel
05:11  b0o-yeah: Kimbo1986: on that page look under "Physical" and then height it says 9.5
05:11  b0o-yeah: thats 9.5mm

CD drive spun and then nothing. No boot. It just sits at a black screen and the light on the latch stays a dim white

06:24  b0o-yeah: I hate it when what you are describing happens and yes I have had the same problem

06:26  allenk|phone: Pram is command control p r
06:27 +Tomis: it's changed over time, i never remember which for which model
06:27 +Tomis: isn't it command-option-p-r?
06:27  b0o-yeah: Tomis: yes
06:27  allenk|phone: Yeah, that's it
06:27  b0o-yeah: allenk|phone: when I had that problem it did in fact boot ... could see the screen with a flashlight
06:27  allenk|phone: I was doing both :P
06:28  allenk|phone: b0o-yeah: Did it chime?
06:28  torchie: it'd be great to have things that never broke
06:28  b0o-yeah: allenk|phone: I don't remember it might have been muted
06:28  b0o-yeah: i.e. you can mute the startup chime 
06:29  b0o-yeah: well yeah it kept randomly happening and now that machine has been converted into a desktop computer 
06:29  b0o-yeah: and a new laptop has taken its place
06:30  allenk|phone: It's like something got stuck in the ram prior to it shutting down and it's preventing it from starting the boot sequence
06:30 +Tomis: it's probably borking up trying to load the hibernation image
06:32  allenk|phone: I plugged it in right before it went to sleep
06:32  allenk|phone: And I think that messed it up
06:32 +Tomis: who knows
06:33 +Tomis: whatever the problem, it's not your fault, it shouldn't be failing like it is
06:33  allenk|phone: Lol, I hate this laptop
06:33  allenk|phone: Always have
06:34 +Tomis: nothing but problems eh?
06:34  allenk|phone: Yep
06:34 +Tomis: get it serviced?
06:34  allenk|phone: I got a great deal on it though which is the only way I bought it XD
06:35  b0o-yeah: hehe now you know why the deal was soo good
06:35 +Tomis: got it used?
06:36  allenk|phone: b0o-yeah: Nope. I bought one for $700. SuperDrive was broken upon arrival, was still under warranty. So apple couldn't fix it after 3 née SuperDrives. Replaced it with an upgraded newer model. So I got a $2300 MacBook pro for $700
06:37 +Tomis: awesome
06:37  allenk|phone: That's one of the few things I still like about apple
06:38  b0o-yeah: ah
06:39  allenk|phone: But, this MBP isn't under warranty or apple care anymore
06:40  allenk|phone: I wish it was. I'd get a new MacBook pro XD
06:40  allenk|phone: I'm having the same SuperDrive problem and now this
06:40 * b0o-yeah is very tempted to buy apple care before its too late
06:40 +Tomis: applecare is essential on laptops
06:40  b0o-yeah: as that way I would be covered past the date I graduate from college 
06:40 +Tomis: i wouldnt bother on the desktops
06:41 +Tomis: yea get it on edu discount b0o-yeah 
06:41  EdLin: Tomis: I would, I had a failed mac mini with a logicboard replacement. costs $380
06:41  EdLin: Tomis: Apple charges an arm and a leg for parts that are commodity-priced on PCs.
06:41 +Tomis: like i said, essential on the laptops EdLin 
06:42  b0o-yeah: Tomis: indeed 
06:42  EdLin: Tomis: a mac mini is a desktop....
06:42 +Tomis: nah, mac mini is just a laptop without a useful
06:42  EdLin: lol
06:42 +Tomis: take away the screen, battery, and built-in keyboard
06:42  b0o-yeah: umm I saw a student once bring a mac mini with them to class along with a monitor etc
06:42 +Tomis: what do ya got, a mac mini
06:42 +Tomis: smack them b0o-yeah 
06:43  b0o-yeah: I wanted to
06:43 +Tomis: that's almost as bad as those imac carrying cases, lol
06:43  b0o-yeah: haha yeah
06:43  EdLin: sigh, mac minis don't get any respect. :-(
06:44  b0o-yeah: umm they have sex appeal 
06:44 +Tomis: they cost too much, always have
06:44 +Tomis: once you add in everything else, might as well get an imac
06:44  EdLin: Tomis: I already had a 22" monitor from my PC.
06:44  EdLin: and keyboard, and mouse.
06:44 +Tomis: sell the monitor, put the moeny towards a laptop
06:45  EdLin: Tomis: towards a Mac laptop? That's a lot more than what a monitor fetches for nowadays.
06:46  EdLin: Tomis: of course, now that Apple's raised the Mac mini prices....
06:46 +Tomis: ooohhh
06:46 +Tomis: apple store is down!!
06:46 +Tomis: they're probably just doing a graphics refresh for the christmas season
06:47  ErrantEgo: bahumbug

08:23  CPng|N: nope
08:23  floydfanx: right on
08:25  iaj: lo there
08:27  floydfanx: epic failure
08:29 +Tomis: epic wintasm
08:30  floydfanx: lol
08:31 +Tomis: keep it in the room, no need for PM floydfanx 
08:32  floydfanx: k tomis
08:33  floydfanx: just rather not spam the room with my retarded questions
08:34 +Tomis: then you're missing the entire point of IRC
08:34  floydfanx: tomis do u use torrents on yr mac?
08:34 +Tomis: nope, i purchase my content
08:35  floydfanx: ha
08:35  floydfanx: the problem with that is
08:35  floydfanx: i would,except they offer crappy digital compressed version if u buy it legally
08:35 +Tomis: we have itunes now, torrents are a thing of the past
08:35  floydfanx: unless yr buying the physical cd
08:35 +Tomis: then buy the CD
08:35  floydfanx: u get low quality vbr
08:35  floydfanx: itunes...
08:35 +Tomis: 256VBR AAC
08:35  floydfanx: compresses music
08:35  floydfanx: thats terrible
08:36 +Tomis: not really
08:36  floydfanx: u lose so many instruments
08:36 +Tomis: i challenege you to tell the difference
08:36  floydfanx: listen to the same file in flac
08:36  floydfanx: ummm
08:36  floydfanx: i do
08:36  floydfanx: notice it extremly
08:36  floydfanx: when i play the pure flac lossless file r u kidding me?
08:36 +Tomis: on your expensive high-end surround sound system?
08:36  floydfanx: versus even a 320 converted file
08:36  floydfanx: yes
08:36  floydfanx: my onkyo system
08:36  torchie: I listened to the same album in 320kbps MP3 and flac on one machine, with panasonic IEMs
08:36 +Tomis: then you have the money to purchase the content legally
08:36  torchie: I could barely tell the difference but keep this in mind:
08:37 +Tomis: so youve no need to torrent it
08:37  torchie: it was a kanye west album
08:37  floydfanx: or my sennheiser phones
08:37 +Tomis: case closed
08:37  b0o-yeah: torchie: haha
08:37  iaj: kanye west :p
08:37  torchie: dark twisted fantasy lol
08:37  floydfanx: im a musician,,i really hear things and tones that are not in the vbr parameters
08:37  b0o-yeah: you really need headphones IMO to really tell the difference and sure I can tell the difference between say 128 and 192
08:37  torchie: anyway regardless of whether or not we can hear the difference
08:37  koro: you can perfectly well use torrents and still "purchase all your content"
08:37  b0o-yeah: but 192 to 256 is pretty hard to tell
08:38  floydfanx: i have sennheiser hd500
08:38  floydfanx: and i can tell the differance
08:38  torchie: fidelity reigns supreme
08:38  floydfanx: <---audiophile
08:38  floydfanx: man im ready for wax
08:38  b0o-yeah: I have sennheiser HD595's and AKG k240MKII
08:38  torchie: imagine if over the years we just distributed nothing but compressed and recompressed replicas of the mona lisa
08:38  floydfanx: oh yeah
08:38  floydfanx: how do ulike the akg's??
08:38  floydfanx: vs the senn's
08:38  floydfanx: ?
08:39  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: I prefer the AKGs
08:39  floydfanx: may i ask why
08:39  b0o-yeah: they are way more comfortable on my head
08:39  floydfanx: how are the akgs on the mids and highs
08:39  b0o-yeah: granted they are like massive but I like the look
08:39  floydfanx: do u use an amp?
08:39  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: I think the senn's may be slightly better technically but honestly I love the sound of the AKGs
08:40  floydfanx: i dont like my senns,,i mean i do
08:40  floydfanx: but i think im gonna try a grado 225
08:40  b0o-yeah: floydfanx:  well its plugged into my Yamaha receiver for all the Silent Cinema goodness
08:40  b0o-yeah: and they are like only 55Ω
08:40  floydfanx: supposed to be really good for rock
08:40  floydfanx: have u heard any grados?
08:40  b0o-yeah: nope
08:40  floydfanx: supposed to be really good
08:40  floydfanx: grado 225
08:40  floydfanx: for rock especially
08:41  floydfanx: but its not closed its open
08:41  floydfanx: noise canceling ect.
08:41  b0o-yeah: all my headphones are open
08:41  floydfanx:  yeah when i travel i need the closed 1's
08:41  b0o-yeah: well the k240s are semi open
08:42  b0o-yeah: I might get a pair of the senn DJ headphones for out and about
08:42  floydfanx: go for the senn 280 pros
08:42  floydfanx: there closed
08:42  floydfanx: and pretty good
08:42  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: yeah those are what I was thinking
08:42  floydfanx: pretty cheap
08:42  floydfanx: 100 bux
08:42  floydfanx: us
08:43  floydfanx: u can get em for now
08:43  b0o-yeah: although for the time being I am not planning on buying anymore headphones
08:43 +Tomis: i can't imagine having anything other than cheep earbuds for out and about
08:43  floydfanx: tomis im an audiophile
08:43  floydfanx: that doesnt cutt it for me
08:43 +Tomis: yea...
08:43  floydfanx: im currently looking for a decnt portable amp
08:43  b0o-yeah: Tomis: well I use PX100s for out and about currently but they don't cut out the sound around me... but generally when outside I want to hear the car per say ;)
08:43  floydfanx: to drive my headphones
08:43  floydfanx: boo do u have an amp
08:43 +Tomis: get monsters floydfanx 
08:43  floydfanx: how much?
08:44  floydfanx: are they roughly
08:44  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: yes I built one but honestly its not that good...I like to just plug straight into my receiver
08:44  floydfanx: yeah but
08:44 +Tomis:  /facepalm
08:44  floydfanx: the high end headphones really need an amp
08:45  iaj: hmmm the problem that im getting a lot of disconnects either if I am @ home at wlan or at work via lan cable couldn't be a mac problem - coult it?
08:45  floydfanx: when yr out and about
08:45 +Tomis: really, if you want high quality audio, don't go with digital
08:45  floydfanx: agreed
08:45 +Tomis: live music or nohing
08:45  floydfanx: but digital is so easy
08:45 +Tomis: pay a ban to follow you around
08:45 +Tomis: *band
08:45  floydfanx: i like my flacs
08:45  iaj: could - not coult -_-
08:45  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: yes they do... some receivers are great for that but again my headphones are not high z
08:45  floydfanx: yeah like
08:45  b0o-yeah: and you honestly can't get audiophile listening out and about
08:45  b0o-yeah: so I don't bother
08:45  floydfanx: most phones take 100 hours of burn in time,,and they really start to sound different...same thing with ANY speakers imo
08:46  floydfanx: they must be burned in
08:46  floydfanx: i like to use pink noise 
08:46  floydfanx: gets the job done quicker
08:46 +Tomis: lol
08:46  floydfanx: what!
08:46  floydfanx: u dont belive in burning in equipment
08:46  floydfanx: to loosen the drivers ect
08:46  b0o-yeah: floydfanx: don't use too much snake oil
08:46 +Tomis: like i said, use monster-everything
08:46  torchie: monster what
08:47 +Tomis: monster cables, monster bullshit
08:47 +Tomis: monster everything
08:47  floydfanx: tomis how much do they go for 
08:47  floydfanx: expensive?
08:47  b0o-yeah: yes burn in makes a difference with headphones but people go way to far with this idea
08:47 +Tomis: if you're paying less than $300 for that cable
08:47 +Tomis: it's not pro quality!
08:47  floydfanx: i dont wnna ask how much a portable amp would cost even
08:47  floydfanx: :(
08:47  torchie: I got a pair of panasonic rp-hje900
08:47  torchie: last pair of headphones I'll ever need
08:47 +Tomis: it needs to be gold tipped and gold plated and gold lines too!
08:47  torchie: build quality is badass
08:48  floydfanx: i wanna start a wax collection
08:48  b0o-yeah: umm what now?
08:48  floydfanx: vinyl
08:48  CPng|N: don't do it
08:48  b0o-yeah: oh I have never heard it called that
08:48 +Tomis: vinyl is outdated
08:48 +Tomis: CDs are much higher fidelity
08:48  floydfanx: ummm
08:48  torchie: just go on tour with the band guys
08:48  floydfanx: not really
08:48 +Tomis: you can tell because they're shinier
08:48  floydfanx: i hear a differance imo
08:48  CPng|N: play your CDs, but cover the tweeters with a sheet of paper. 
08:49 +Tomis: and digital is so shiny you can't even *see* it
08:49 +Tomis: so you know it must be tops
08:49  floydfanx: man
08:49  floydfanx: i love my mac,but it pisses me off
08:50 +Tomis: sell it and get a mainframe
08:50  floydfanx: lol
08:50  b0o-yeah: hehe
08:52  torchie: if you want a computer you'll just have to DO IT YOURSELF
08:52 +Tomis: yup
08:52  torchie: the whole coding your own operating system part will take a while though
08:52 +Tomis: go mine the resources
08:52 +Tomis: then process it all
08:52 +Tomis: down with outsourcing
08:52 +Tomis: if you can't make it yourself, you don't deserve it
08:54 +Berzerker: anyone know how to update the google chrome flash to the latest version?
08:54 +Berzerker: wanna try out 10.2
08:55 +Tomis: just swap out the relevant plugin file in the applciation bundle i'd assume Berzerker 
08:56  iaj: any advantages of 10.2?
08:56 +Berzerker: nearly full CPU off-loading to GPU
08:56 +Berzerker: from what I've read
08:56 +Tomis: i doubt it Berzerker 
08:57 +Tomis: more like, some GPU decoding of video content
08:57 +Berzerker: well good for you
08:57  iaj: Berzerker: when you try it out - can you tell me the results?
08:57 +Berzerker: where does flash install itself?
08:57 +Tomis: for chrome Berzerker ?
08:57 +Berzerker: no
08:57 +Tomis: or the system wide one
08:57 +Berzerker: yes
08:57  CPng|N: 10.2 is gold?
08:57 +Berzerker: beta
08:57 +Tomis: yea, system wide is in /library/internet plug-ins/
08:58 +Tomis: then you'd need to dig into Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/7.0.517.41/Google Chrome Framework.framework/Internet Plug-Ins/
08:58 +Tomis: and swap out the "Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin"
08:58 +Berzerker: yeah I got it
08:58 +Berzerker: thanks
08:58 +Tomis: might be able to just pull it out and put the new one in, or it might be hard coded to use that name
08:59  CPng|N: "The latest version enables hardware accelerated graphics in Internet Explorer 9"
08:59 +Berzerker: Flash Player.plugin
08:59 +Berzerker: works
09:00 +Berzerker: err
09:00 +Berzerker: You have version 10,2,151,49 installed
09:00 +Tomis: did you measure system load before?
09:00 +Berzerker: I'm testing it now
09:00 +Tomis: and then see how much it changes after
09:00 +Tomis: k
09:00 +Tomis: that's kinda nifty actually
09:00 +Berzerker: I was at around 75/400%
09:00 +Tomis: make a copy of chrome
09:00 +Tomis: on with the old version, one with the new one
09:01 +Tomis: thenyou can easily test between them
09:01 +Berzerker: well
09:01 +Berzerker: literally nothing
09:01 +Berzerker: lol
09:01 +Berzerker: it's maybe 20-30% reduced
09:01 +Berzerker: at best
09:01 +Berzerker: not bad
09:02  CPng|N: nice, finally: "Support for full screen mode with multiple monitors — Full screen content will remain in full-screen on secondary monitors, allowing users to watch full-screen content while working on another display."
09:02 +Berzerker: oh my god
09:02 +Berzerker: it does work
09:02 +Berzerker: excellent!
09:02  torchie: what does what happen
09:02 +Berzerker: finally
09:02 +Tomis: so from 75% to 50%ish
09:02  torchie: what happenlasfj
09:02 +Berzerker: Tomis: well...
09:02 +Berzerker: full screen or not?
09:02 +Tomis: test it all!!
09:02 +Tomis: heh
09:02 +Berzerker: non full-screen was higher, that had almost no change
09:02 +Berzerker: still at about 100/400
09:03 +Berzerker: full screen is at about 25%
09:03 +Tomis: i'd imagine fullscreen would get better performance in some cases actually
09:03 +Berzerker: so it's pretty reduced
09:03  CPng|N: ahahah.  the video on http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/  is out of sync, at least on my FF 3.8/MBP
09:03 +Tomis: since it gets its own window to render into
09:03 +Berzerker: especially now that you can watch in fullscreen while focued on other windows
09:03 +Berzerker: this version is a keeper

09:05  Kasm279|Away: night
09:07 +Berzerker: WOW
09:07 +Berzerker: why is the newsfire dev so irritating like that
09:07 +Berzerker: he forces you to subscribe to his blogfeed
09:07 +Tomis: forces you how
09:07 +Berzerker: the option to "remove" the feed is greyed out
09:07 +Tomis: it's not just a pre-loaded feed
09:08 +Tomis: lol
09:08 +Tomis: awesome
09:08 +Berzerker: and if you change the link to the feed, you can remove it
09:08 +Berzerker: but when you open the app again, it adds it back in
09:08 +Tomis: that'll teach the users
09:08 +Berzerker: to not use the program maybe
09:08 +Berzerker: every comment on his blog asking him about it is deleted
09:08 +Berzerker: I just want a really good RSS client that syncs with google reader
09:09 +Tomis: how do you know they get deleted if they're deleted?
09:09 +Berzerker: because I've posted some
09:09 +Berzerker: and I don't see anyone else complaining about it, I'm sure people do
09:10 +Tomis: i wonder why
09:10 +Tomis: is he monotizing the blog in some way?
09:10 +Tomis: using it to push other products?
09:10 +Berzerker: xtorrent
09:10 +Berzerker: and he's got other paid aps
09:10 +Berzerker: apps*
09:11 +Tomis: ah, well that's why
09:12 +Tomis: is there some paid version of this app?
09:12 +Tomis: maybe it doesn't have the forced feed
09:12  iaj: Berzerker: well so its only worth it once I tend to watch flashs in fullscreen a lot?
09:12 +Berzerker: iaj: I gues
09:12 +Berzerker: s
09:13  iaj: thanks )

09:46  Untouchab1e: Soo
09:46  Untouchab1e: Im considering a Mac Pro
09:46  Untouchab1e: to replace my custom built desktop computer..
09:47  Untouchab1e: Can someone give me the downsides of the Mac Pro though?
09:47  Untouchab1e: I dont do lots of heavy 3d graphics editing or HD video editing either, but I just want a powerful rig which will last. Ill use it for software development, a bit of gaming I guess, web design..
09:49 +Tomis: the downside: it's a mac
09:49 +Tomis: the upside: it's not only a PC, it's also a mac
09:49 +Berzerker: Tomis: how much power does keeping the RAM awake use?
09:49 +Berzerker: as in sleep non hibernate
09:50 +Tomis: probably about as much as having that damn LED pulsating Berzerker 
09:50 +Berzerker: lol
09:51 +Tomis: ahh th ambient light sensor is to the left of the isight
09:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
10:04  Untouchab1e: Tomis: valid points, lol
10:04  Untouchab1e: I know swapping out RAM and Graphics-card is easy enough
10:04  Untouchab1e: but I cant use any PCI-E graphics card, right?
10:04  Untouchab1e: it has to be a mac-edition?
10:04  Untouchab1e: cuz I have the GTX285 in my PC
10:05  Untouchab1e: and Im thinking of either ordering the Mac pro with the 5870, or go with the cheaper one and buy something better?
10:07 +Tomis: yea it would need to be a mac version of the card

10:09  Untouchab1e: Tomis: I see
10:10  Untouchab1e: and how is the availability? I guess the 5870 will work for a while
10:10  Untouchab1e: but how are they priced compared to their regular counterparts?
10:11 +Tomis: more expensive, always
10:12  Untouchab1e: Tomis: lol
10:12  Untouchab1e: As expected I guess

12:21  AnthonyCat: I'm about to install snow leopard, but first I want to back up one folder. I can't put it on an external device. Now I remember there is something I can do, like an option in the SL installer that lets me keep some stuff. What is it and what does it do?

12:39  iaj: im getting disced all the time, when im at home via airport - or at work via cable - could it be me?? if y.. how could I find out?
12:41  richardcavell: post more info
12:41  richardcavell: and post it to #networking
12:48  Lusule: hi guys, quick question - i'm having trouble running commands from terminal.  echo $path is blank.  I tried creating a .login file in my home directory containing the obvious paths but after restarting terminal, echo $path is still blank.  How do I get MacOS to acknowledge where my commands are?
12:49 +Branes: ... Mac owners still use the commandline? The mind boggles.
12:49  widoz: Lusule modify your ~/.profile 
12:50  AnthonyCat: richardcavell: ther stuff I need to back up is too large
12:50  widoz: append the PATH
12:50  Lusule: i don't have a ~/.profile, and if I rename my .login to that, and restart terminal, nothing happens
12:51 +Branes: Anthony, I came in late, what are you trying to do?
12:51 +Tomis: the installer will keep all user files. but really you should have a backup solution in place already as richardcavell mentioned
12:51 +Tomis: he wants to instal SL and as under the impression it would wipe out his users
12:51  widoz: Lusule sorry that is for macport :( 
12:51 +Tomis: i explained that the old "archive & instal" behavior is now the default
12:52  AnthonyCat: thanks Tomis
12:52  AnthonyCat: I just want everything to be nice and clean after reinstalling, but keeping one folder.
12:52 +Tomis: then chuck everything except that folder
12:52  iaj: richardcavell: sorry about that - shoulda gone to networking directly - just thought it might be a mac issue
12:53  AnthonyCat: what do you mean by chuck? Where would I put my folder
12:53 +Tomis: ideally you'd just backup, then wipe, and restore that one folder after AnthonyCat 
12:53 +Tomis: chuck, throw away, remove, get rid of, delete
12:54  AnthonyCat: So delete everything, except for my folder: /Backup ?
12:54 +Tomis: sure
12:54 +Tomis: but it's still gonna be a bit messy
12:54  AnthonyCat: Tomis: messy with what?
12:55 +Tomis: you're wanting to delete everything from a running system save for one directory
12:56  AnthonyCat: ok, so I delete everything in Terminal running from the SL dvd, and that one folder will stay?
12:56 +Tomis: oh man
12:56 +Tomis: just hope you don't delete that one folder when you go doing that
12:56  AnthonyCat: lol
12:56  AnthonyCat: sudo rm -rf /
12:57 +Tomis: seriously you should have a backup drive anyway
12:57 +Tomis: $80, can save you a world of hurt
12:57  AnthonyCat: $80 to buy what?
12:57  AnthonyCat: external hard drive?
12:57 +Tomis: yes
13:01 +Branes: Seconded.
13:01  dnordstrom: Mhm
13:02 +Branes: If you want "everything to be nice and clean after reinstalling, but keeping one folder", then put that folder's worth of stuff on another volume.
13:02  AnthonyCat: Branes: I don't have another volume
13:02  AnthonyCat: but I could partition maybe?
13:02 +Tomis: oh god
13:02 +Branes: Then everything isn't going to be "nice and clean", is it?
13:02  dnordstrom: How large is that folder?
13:03 +Tomis: yea how big is this folder anyway
13:03  AnthonyCat: 60 GB
13:03 +Branes: Look. Go buy another hard drive. You need it. Once you have everything freshly formatted and ready to go, you have a drive for your Time Machine backups. Remember, any data that is not backed up is data you do not want. Cardinal rule, that.
13:04 +Tomis: yea, that's 60GB worth of stuff you're basically asking to throw away at any moment
13:05 +Branes: And no, you can't repartition the drive and expect the data to remain. Partitioning doesn't work that way.
13:05 +Tomis: well actually you could
13:05 +Branes: You need to get the data you want to keep onto another physical device first.
13:06 +Tomis: but it will tell you you should backup first just in case the partitioning process goes to hell
13:06 +Branes: And that's about as safe as walking barefoot through a stream full of piranhas, Tomis.
13:06 +Tomis: i've live partioned my systems before without issue
13:07  AnthonyCat: Branes: really? I've done it loads of times, and it's never stuffed up
13:07 +Branes: So've I. Sometimes it works as expeced, other times it has not.
13:07 +Branes: There is no guarantee.
13:09  Lusule: okay i think i've figured out how to get it to recognise my preferred path choices, but i want to reference a /bin folder located in ~/Application Support, I think maybe the space is throwing it because that path isn't showing up, how do I reference a path with a space in the name?
13:10 +Tomis: use \
13:10 +Tomis: or quote the path
13:10  Lusule: i tried \ but it didn't do much
13:14  AnthonyCat: If I was to leave the one folder as /Backup, then in terminal (running off the SL dvd) did sudo rm (everything except Backup), and then continued to install SL, would I still have the folder once everything's done?
13:15 +Tomis: yes AnthonyCat 
13:15 +Tomis: it's not going to magically wipe the drive because you told it to instal the OS
13:15  Lusule: quoting worked, when i remembered to restart terminal :D
13:15  Lusule: thanks!
13:15 +Tomis: though i still think it's a bad idea not having a backup drive
13:16  AnthonyCat: Tomis: maybe one day. Thanks
13:44 --- riba is now known as web_knows
13:48  dnordstrom: I remember back in the days when I was sitting in my room back home playing around with Linux distros as Win 2000, ahh... Partitioned the disk so nicely because just like Anthony I wanted to keep my stuff, music collection, porn whatever it was. But before I knew it, I had deleted sda1 instead of sda2 or whatever they were called. everything gone except a very clean install.
13:48  dnordstrom: That's why you always want an external drive.
13:48  dnordstrom: Always.
13:49  dnordstrom: Or cloud computing perhaps, some nice remote drive, but 60GB is a bit much then.

13:58  js_: rocks until you have more than one client to back up :)
13:58 +Tomis: what do you mean
13:58  dnordstrom: Yeah?
13:58 +Tomis: you can use one drive for multiple computers
13:58  dnordstrom: I back up two computers with mine sometimes. Haven't tried doing it at the same time though
13:58  js_: sure, but it suddenly involves extra hassle
13:58 +Tomis: well that would be a lot of trashing
13:59 +Tomis: how so js_ 
13:59  js_: time capsule is good, but the available space is a limitation
13:59 +Tomis: 1TB and 2TB right now
13:59  js_: i would like a more corporate version of time machine in osx server than simply "allow users to back up to this drive"
13:59 +Tomis: can you use the external on it for TM as well

14:02 +Tomis: i wonder when they'll add airplay to mac os x
14:05  dnordstrom: Oh yeah
15:09  Lusule: does anyone know where i can find support for using latex and bibtex on a mac?
15:15  ayaz: Lusule: you could probably start here: http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
15:16  Lusule: thanks ayaz but i've already read that.  I've got myself into a horrible muddle over the whole thing
15:17  ayaz: Lusule: which distribution did you try to build/setup?
15:17  Lusule: ayaz - i installed mactex
15:18  ayaz: Lusule: No luck?
15:18  Lusule: ayaz notta clue what i'm doing.  I admit i'm not a natural techie, I just hate word processors
15:19  Lusule: the real issue is trying to get my harvard bibliography style recognised
15:19  Lusule: the instructions that come with the harvard style package *seem* intuitive enough, but it ain't working
15:19  Lusule: i think it's due to pathing issues but i'm now officially lost
15:20  ayaz: Lusule: Just so I don't forget, there's also LyX for Mac:  http://wiki.lyx.org/Mac/Mac
15:22  Lusule: ayaz I know, I've used it on my old Windows machine.  I don't like it
15:22  Lusule: I really enjoy being able to just write stuff out in any old editor
15:22  Lusule: I'm getting the hang of latex okay, it's bibtex that makes me cry
15:23  ayaz: I haven't any experience with BibTex, I'm afraid.
15:24  Lusule: okay well thanks anyway
15:26  Kasm279|Away: Lusule: i much prefer my AlphaSmart Dana for word proccessing :)
15:27  Lusule: Kasm279|Away: I think my gran used to have something like that...
15:27  Kasm279|Away: what colour was it?
15:28  Lusule: what I like about using something like Latex is I can keep everything as .txt files in my Dropbox, and then carry on working from wherever I am
15:28  Kasm279|Away: yeah
15:28  Lusule: black, doing think it was one of those exactly, i think it was pre-1993, but she used to love it.  That was as far as she ever wanted technology to go
15:28  Lusule: *don't think
15:29  Lusule: ooh no it wasn't quite like that, that does actually look quite funky
15:29  Lusule: and would fit into my current workflow :D
15:30  Kasm279|Away: hm
15:30  Kasm279|Away: alphamsart hasn't made anything thats black
15:30  Kasm279|Away: well
15:30  Kasm279|Away: err, i mean
15:30  Kasm279|Away: alphasmarts only thing that could be called black were released in 2002 (Dana) 2003 (Dana Wireless) 2004 (Neo) and 2005 (Neo2)
15:30  Lusule: hers was a sort of bridge between a type writer and a primitive computer
15:31  Lusule: it held everything in memory until you were happy, and only then did the paper start spooling
15:31  Kasm279|Away: spooling?
15:31  Kasm279|Away: oh
15:31  Kasm279|Away: i see
15:31  Lusule: as in instead of printing out one line at a time like a typewriter, it would print the whole page more like a printer
15:31  Kasm279|Away: i actually have a brother typewriter over there on the floor that can do that
15:31  Kasm279|Away: yeah
15:32  Kasm279|Away: the alphasmarts kinda work like that
15:32  Kasm279|Away: except instead of printing they type it into the computer
15:32  Lusule: yeah, this was pre '95 and we weren't about to teach my Gran DOS
15:33  Kasm279|Away: theres the original AlphaSmart that only has ADB, the Pro which is near the same but also has a PS/2 port
15:33  Kasm279|Away: lmao
15:33  Kasm279|Away: thats pre-me
15:33  Kasm279|Away: i was born in '95 :|
15:33  Lusule: lol
15:33  Kasm279|Away: anyway, then theres the 2000 which is green and rounded
15:33  Kasm279|Away: little more memory than the pro but otherwise unchanged
15:34  Lusule: anyway, interesting device but still doesn't help me sort out my bibliography problem :(
15:34  Kasm279|Away: then came the 3000, which switched from an ADB an dPS/2 port to a combo  USB/ADB/PS/2 port and added a Din-9 combo serial and parallel port
15:34  Kasm279|Away: don't ask me how they did the combos :)
15:34  Kasm279|Away: yeah
15:34  Kasm279|Away: :\
15:35  Kasm279|Away: i gotta finish now that i have started
15:35  Kasm279|Away: anyway, then came the Dana with its larger, touch sensitive screen, dual SD card slots, a USB port for a printer (prism based wireless USB dongles can also be used int he printer port on non-wireless models)
15:36  Kasm279|Away: oh, and Palm OS
15:36  Kasm279|Away: and amuch improved keyboard
15:36  Kasm279|Away: don't buy a 3000/2000
15:36  Kasm279|Away: or at least a 3000 with a translucent keyboard
15:36  Kasm279|Away: ive heard the opaque keyboards are better but i haven't tried them (same thing that the 2000 has)
15:37  Kasm279|Away: anyway, after the Dana, and just a few days after its one year aniversarry, they released the Dana Wireless, which adds wifi and ups the RAM to 16MB
15:37  lusule__: testing
15:37  Kasm279|Away: testing?
15:37  lusule__: having connection issues
15:37  Kasm279|Away: you probably missed the tidbit on keyboards didn't you
15:37  Kasm279|Away: i see that :P

15:39  Kasm279|Away: anyway, continuing on
15:39  Kasm279|Away: then came the Neo which finally replaced the 3000
15:40  Kasm279|Away: the Neo is like the 3000 but it has a larger dot matrix screen, has a shape based from the Dana, and instead of having a Din-9 connection to a printer it has a USB port
15:41  Kasm279|Away: then the Neo2 fixed some issues, changed to grey (neo is green) and added a wireless radio of some sort that works with the 2Know! system that ReanLearn has
15:41  Kasm279|Away: and thats basically it :D

16:52  denysonique_: Is the Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.3 a bootable install disk
16:52  denysonique_: ?
16:52 +Tomis: the DVDs that came with the system are yes
16:52 +Tomis: and the retail bought version is as well
16:53  diamonds: windowkey + e: open new Explorer.  Mac/finder equivalent? I looked here http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343 and saw cmd+shift+c but that is overridden by at least a two apps I commonly use (ff+web dev, and colloquy)
16:53 +Tomis: to boot from the DVD, you need to hold C with the disk in while the machine boots
16:53  diamonds: I know I'll prolly be told "that's your APP-SPECIFIC problem" but I just wanted to check, perhaps I'm missing something. :) thanks in advance!
16:53  denysonique_: Tomis, actually, I bout this DVD to try it in a VM
16:53  denysonique_: on a PC
16:53  denysonique_: using virtualbox
16:53 +Tomis: that's not supported denysonique_ 
16:54 +Tomis: in fact it very clearly violates the terms of the license for the software
16:54  denysonique_: Tomis, I know it is, but I need to try the OS out before I pay 1k for the hardware
16:54 +Tomis: look in the menus for the finder diamonds , File>New Window
16:54  denysonique_: I already paid for the dvd
16:55  Velociraptors: diamonds: at a guess, are you doing command-shift-C from any app? afaik it'll only work when you've already got Finder active (ie clicked on the desktop first, selected it in the dock, or command-tabbed to it)
16:55  iaj: gna someone in here sticking to macvim?
16:55 +Tomis: well what you want to do is run it on a PC (not designed for it, not supported), and in a VM (not designed for it, not supported)
16:55  diamonds: Velociraptors: Tomis yeah I was looking for a... "master" I guess, cross-app "open finder window" hotkey
16:55 +Tomis: there isn't one diamonds 
16:55  diamonds: like windows+e
16:55  diamonds: Tomis: ok, ty!
16:55 +Tomis: switch to finder, hit cmd-N
16:56 +Tomis: i usually prefer to reuse an open window than to create  new one
16:56  Velociraptors: diamonds:  you *may* be able to set up something like that from within System Prefs->Keyboard->Keyboard Shortcuts. 
16:56  diamonds: yeah I use spaces, and that frequently moves me to another screen
16:56  denysonique_: Tomis, I know it is not supported, I know that it violates the EULA, I joined this channel for some advice on running os x on vbox
16:56  diamonds: Velociraptors: oh?  Ok I'll look into it at some point
16:56 +Tomis: cmd-tab to finder, cmd-` to a window i want, navigate where i need to
16:56  diamonds: denysonique_: read the topic :p
16:56  Velociraptors: (I've never messed about in there myself, but some shortcuts such as command-shift-3 for a screenshot work no matter which app is set up)
16:57 +Tomis: as i said, completely unsupported, so you're not going to get much help on that denysonique_ 
16:57  Velociraptors: no matter which app is in front, sorry. Tired :)
16:57  denysonique_: Tomis, unsupported by whom?
16:57 +Tomis: by apple
16:57 +Tomis: the OS is not designed to be used on anything other than a Mac
16:57  diamonds: Velociraptors: np thank you for the help. Tomis yeah that's what I do, I was looking for a quicker/better solution (like windows).
16:58 * diamonds runs
16:58  Velociraptors: denysonique_:  you might find more useful help in the hackintosh channels - folk here generally have OSX on Mac hardware, and only have the experience to deal with its issues - you have a whole new set of potential hassles in a VM, and other folk would be way more help there
16:58 +Tomis: you could potentially set something up to do what you want diamonds 
16:58  diamonds: Tomis: yes ty, I'm going to look into what Velociraptors mentioned when I get a free moment
16:58  diamonds: ty everyone!
16:59 +Tomis: create an applescript, throw the applescript into the global script menu, then assign it a shortcut in system prefs
16:59 +Tomis: something along those lines
16:59  diamonds: Tomis: ahhh... yeah that sounds even better
17:01  diamonds: I'll have to look into that.  I use Quicksilver but frankly I'd like some things to be one-press, rather than the 3 required by default quicksilver.  I think it does hotkeys too, but I haven't looked into it
17:01  denysonique_: Velociraptors, right, thanks, do you know if there is a hackintosh channel on this network?
17:01  Velociraptors: there's not
17:01 +Tomis: what the crap
17:02 +Tomis: why isn't the summarize service turned on by default
17:02 +Tomis: weird
17:02 +Tomis: services are such an awesome idea that apple's just like linger and get forgotten
17:03 +Tomis: at least they show some of them in the contextual menus now
17:41  WormFood: how can I tell if OSX is running in 32 or 64 bit mode?
17:42 +Branes: Unless you specifically told it to at launch, its in 32-bit mode. I think it should tell you in System Profiler.
17:42  WormFood: I did tell it to boot in 64-bit mode
17:43  WormFood: I run Linux as my main OS, so when I installed it, it gave me 2 boot menu items for osx...32 and 64 bit mode...I suspect it is really in 32-bit mode, but wanted to confirm
17:44  Velociraptors: check in System Profiler - it'll have a section for "64 bit kernel and extensions" 
17:44  Velociraptors: Yes or No, there
17:45  WormFood: ok, I'm checking now (I did look in the system profiler, but din't see anything that was clearly an indication)
17:45  Velociraptors: select 'Software' from the left hand pane once you're in Sys Profiler
17:45  Velociraptors: it'll give a system software overview there
17:46  WormFood: yes, I just discovered that....I overlooked the software group, thinking that it was just an empty branch....but it is in 64-bit mode :D
17:46  Angostura: You're looking for the line that says: 64-bit Kernel and Extensions:	No
17:46  WormFood: but it says "64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes" :D
17:47  Velociraptors: WormFood:  could you open up a terminal window and do: uname -a 
17:47  WormFood: thanks Velociraptors and Angostura
17:47  Velociraptors: and paste that here too?
17:47  WormFood: different computer
17:47  WormFood: # uname -a

17:49  WormFood: yeah, but then I'd need to login to it over the network....but uname -a also shows "x86_64" there
17:49 +Branes: I hope you're not being silly enough to run linux on Apple hardware.
17:49 +Branes: Or being even sillier and trying to put OSX on non-Apple hardware.
17:49  WormFood: no, all my apple computers are in USA
17:49  WormFood: yes, OSX runs great on my non-Apple hardware
17:50  Velociraptors: WormFood:  awesome, that's what I wanted to know - thanks :)
17:50 +Branes: Fuck off. We don't help hackintosser slime-moulds.
17:50  WormFood: it appears that the Thinkpad T60 is very similar to the macbook 3.2
17:50  WormFood: or something like that.
17:51  WormFood: Branes, I'm not asking for help with a hackintosh...just OSX...this has nothing to do with the hardware, and there is no need to be abusive about it
17:51 +Branes: Yes there is. You run OSX *only* on Apple hardware. Anyone else gets the living shit kicked out of them.
17:52  WormFood: sorry, the apple computer I have here is dead
17:52 +Branes: Doesn't matter. You want OSX? Buy a new one, or get your old Apple fixed.
17:52  WormFood: don't worry Branes, I don't really run OSX....I just play around with it. I'm really a Linux guy.
17:53 +Branes: My condolences. Doesn't mean you can get away with running OSX on non-Apple machines. Now, piss off.
17:53  WormFood: no, actually, I don't want OSX....this is more or less just for the experience, and just to do it.
17:53 +Branes: Doesn't matter.
17:53 +Branes: You want to mess with OSX? Buy a real Apple.
17:53 +Branes: No ifs ands or buts.
17:53  WormFood: whatever you say Steve Jobs
17:54  WormFood: does Apple pay you to act this way, or do you just naturally feel you're better than everyone else?
17:55 +Branes: No, I just happen to believe the legal stature of the software license.
17:56 +Branes: You want OSX, you ONLY run it on a machine bearing an original Apple design identification plate. Anything else and you're just another slimey linux loser toad.
17:56  WormFood: well, I happen to not believe in that...and I'm not even sure that is enforceable in the country I live in.
17:56  WormFood: I already said, I don't run OSX
17:56 +Branes: You already admitted, you run OSX on non-Apple hardware. Virtually or otherwise.
17:56 +Branes: Which makes you less-than-scum in out eyes.
17:56 +Branes: Now, piss off.
17:57  WormFood: why? because you feel I should have to pay outrageous prices like you did? You feel like I'm getting something for free, because I don't have apple hardware (with me)?
17:58 +Branes: Free software is only free if your personal time is without value.
17:58  WormFood: Actually, I have 2 Macs, back in USA...but I'm not in usa.
17:58 +Branes: Then get one sent over if you want to play with OSX. NO EXCUSE.
17:58  WormFood: who said anything about free software?
17:58 +Branes: You did.
17:58  WormFood: NO I DIDN'T...DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH!
17:59  WormFood: I never said I didn't pay for OSX....I said I didn't pay outrageous prices for apple hardware
18:00 +Branes: I was referring to your misguided addiction to linux, jackanapes.
18:00  WormFood: misguided?
18:00 +Branes: Misguided.
18:00  WormFood: are you an OSX evangelist? Is this a religion for you?
18:00  torchie: what are we talkin bout here
18:00 +Branes: Softwasre only an Aspergers sufferer or someone with acute OCD could ever love.
18:01 +Branes: I'm an interface evangelist.
18:01  WormFood: that is your opinion. I've done some wonderful things with Linux
18:01 +Branes: Apple make interfaces, Microsoft make in-your-faces, linux people are still arguing about how to chip flint.
18:02  WormFood: you're comparing apples and oranges
18:02  ahihi: don't you people have more important things to get angry about
18:02  ahihi: live and let live
18:02 +Branes: Not a chance, hiho.
18:02  torchie: not in my house ahihi
18:02  WormFood: ahihi, yeah, I don't understand his overreaction either
18:03 +Branes: Anyone who runs MacOS on something other than Apple's hardware has an extreme case of fith and in my book, is an automatic candidate for retroactive abortion because thy suffer a lead deficiency -- the cure is 15 grams inserted cranially at high speed, by preference.
18:03  torchie: fith?
18:03 +Branes: Fucked in the head.
18:04 * LaraX agrees with ahihi
18:04  WormFood: he wants to abuse me, and call me names, because I'm playing around with OSX on non-apple hardware...I'm not even serious about it...I don't use OSX, except to show my friends how much better it is than Windows, hoping some of them would ditch winblows.
18:04 +Branes: Doesn't matter. No exception to the OSX-only-on-Apple-hardware rule.
18:04 +Branes: None. Ever.
18:05  WormFood: with all due respect Branes, you can take your overpriced Apple hardware and shove it straight up your ass.
18:05  Angostura: Traditionally, hackintoshers simply get kicked from the channel, partly because it conflicts with Freenode rules. And "I only do a little bit of hackintosh" doesn't really cut ot
18:05  WormFood: I didn't come here to talk about hackintosh
18:06  Angostura: Well, actually you did
18:06 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +o zer0her0]
18:06  WormFood: I originally came here to ask some questions about apple hardware...go back in your logs and look
18:06  Angostura: Just because you didn't use the word, doesn't mean you weren't talking about it
18:06 +LaraX: WormFood: any kind of hackintosh talk isn't allowed anywhere on this network
18:06 +Branes: You came in to ask about OS mode.
18:06 +Branes: You can't even get your *own* facts straight.
18:06  WormFood: Branes, is the one who brought up hackintosh
18:07  WormFood: no I didn't braines...I've been here for a week
18:07 +Branes: You admitted to it, which is against channel & network policy.
18:07  WormFood: YOU brought it up, not me
18:08  Angostura: You were asked a question - your response: "yes, OSX runs great on my non-Apple hardware".
18:08  WormFood: anyways, thanks for your answers to my questions....now and in the past, you guys have been helpful.
18:08 +LaraX: WormFood: he brought it up but you admitted to it...
18:08 +LaraX: [01] 11:49:22 AM <Branes> I hope you're not being silly enough to run linux on Apple hardware.
18:08 +LaraX: [01] 11:49:36 AM <Branes> Or being even sillier and trying to put OSX on non-Apple hardware.
18:08 +LaraX: [01] 11:49:38 AM <WormFood> no, all my apple computers are in USA
18:08 +LaraX: [01] 11:49:43 AM  bushwakko has quit (Client Quit)
18:08 +LaraX: [01] 11:49:50 AM <WormFood> yes, OSX runs great on my non-Apple hardware
18:09  WormFood: jesus fuckin' christ! don't you assholes have anything better to do with your time?
18:09 +Branes: Come back when you've got a real computer, not some overgrown linux toy.
18:09  Velociraptors: Nice weather here. 
18:09  Velociraptors: How about that night, or sun, or something. 
18:09  WormFood: great weather here too Velociraptors
18:09 +LaraX: WormFood: personally I couldn't care less either way, but I don't make the rules either
18:09  WormFood: LaraX, then drop it, and I won't admit to anything anymore
18:10 +Branes: Now that you have, you're not going to get any peace >:)
18:10  WormFood: then there won't be any problems and people won't have to act like they are holier than thou, for having apple hardware that works (the apple I have here has a dead motherboard, so much for Apple quality)
18:11 +Branes: That's a side-effect of having things made in CHina. Every company (except Panasonic) suffers that.
18:11  WormFood: and I went to apple to price a new motherboard...they want 8000 元 (about $1,150 USD) if I don't trade in the old motherboard 
18:11  WormFood: if I trade in the old motherboard, it is 1/2 that price
18:12 +Branes: That's about right. 60-65% of RRP is the cost of a replacement logicboard
18:12  WormFood: if I go to the computer market, I can get a replacement for 1500元
18:12 +Branes: Well get it fixed then, and stop playing with fifth-rate OSes on second-rate hardware.
18:12  WormFood: 1500元 is about $215 USD
18:12  jeremyw: WormFood: You're better off asking for help in hackintosh or some other place.  I've been asked to get involved privately and so I will ask nicely that you go elsewhere with your questions.  Nothing about what you're doing is something we want to help with.
18:13 @zer0her0: WormFood: your story seems to change every 5 seconds
18:13  WormFood: jeremyw, I came here to ask about apple hardware originally
18:13  S_SubZero: are you really complaining to a bunch of Mac owners that Macs cost too much
18:13  webPragmatist1: guys guys
18:14 @zer0her0: WormFood: then ask
18:14  webPragmatist1: it's only wednesday
18:14 --- webPragmatist1 is now known as webPragmatist
18:14  jeremyw: WormFood: You've deviated.
18:14  WormFood: today I asked a question about how to tell if OSX is running in 32 or 64 bit mode....that is all...nothing about hackintosh....please forgive me
18:14  jeremyw: WormFood: Open the Activity MOnitor.
18:14  jeremyw: Every process running will show as 32-bit or 64-bit, even the kernel.
18:14  WormFood: zer0her0, I've already asked, and gotten my answer...I just never left the channel
18:15  WormFood: jeremyw, under "software" it will tell you
18:15 +Branes: That question has already been answered, jer, he just seems to be a glutton for extreme punishment after letting it slip he's hackintossing it up.
18:15  WormFood: jeremyw, also "uname -a" will tell you ;)
18:15 +Branes: And I won't stop abusing the sub-protozoan until he leaves or is kicked.
18:15  jeremyw: There are many answers.  I'm giving you the friendliest.
18:15  jeremyw: haha
18:16  WormFood: thanks jeremyw, my questions have been answered
18:16  WormFood: now I'm just staying for the abuse >:P
18:16  jeremyw: Great.
18:16  webPragmatist: i have a question...
18:16  webPragmatist: why does mail.app hate me?
18:16 +Branes: Now go away or I shall continue to taunt your failed linux ways.
18:16 @zer0her0: webPragmatist: everyone hates you
18:16  WormFood: Branes, you can stop now, because I will go to bed soon...it is a quarter after 1 here
18:16 @zer0her0: so it only makes sense mail would too
18:17 +Branes: Its after 4am where I am, catfood.
18:17 * WormFood erases OSX off his non-apple hardware
18:17  S_SubZero: ever since my work upgraded Exchange I've been using mail.app periodically for mail.  Works exceptionally well. o.O
18:17  WormFood: Branes, where are you? in the middle east?
18:17 +Branes: God's own earth mate.
18:18 +Branes: I'd give you a vegemite sandwich, but you'd probably just try to insyall linux on it.
18:18  WormFood: ok, you're in OZ
18:18  WormFood: I should have guessed
18:18  WormFood: I used to talk to OZ on the radio all the time, back in my ham radio days
18:19 @zer0her0: do you speaka my language? he just smiled @ me and gave me a vegemite sandwich
18:19 --- zer0her0 sets modes [##mac -o zer0her0]
18:19  WormFood: men at work ;)
18:19  zer0her0: aight lunchtime
18:20  WormFood: in fact, a good ozzie friend of mine is supposed to stop by this week
18:21  WormFood: anyways...I'm gonna get out of here...its been real...its been fun....can't say its been real fun....Ya'll have a good day/night/whatever
18:22  webPragmatist: life was so much easier on windows i swear
18:22  webPragmatist: http://screencast.com/t/z0UdVKUj8UnG
18:23 * WormFood gives webPragmatist windows 3.1, and asks if it is easier ;)
18:23  webPragmatist: well i mean windows xp+
18:23  webPragmatist: but if i gave you apple os 3 you'd crap you'd hemorrhage too
18:24  torchie: windows xp was fun on a bun
18:24  torchie: 7 doesn't seem to have the same charm
18:25  webPragmatist: i hate finder with a passion really...
18:25  torchie: I only hate how searching in finder doesn't seem to work
18:25  torchie: and really hope that it's just my computer and not finder itself
18:25  webPragmatist: yea finding stuff with finder
18:25  torchie: because it's a glaring flaw
18:25  torchie: Searching this Mac...
18:25  torchie: Searching this Mac...
18:25  torchie: if you were searching this mac you would have FOUND SOMETHING OK
18:26  webPragmatist: it's like the file browser for retards
18:26  torchie: why
18:26  webPragmatist: i don't even like column view
18:26  webPragmatist: because half the time you can't even go "back" far enough because you opened a certain folder instead
18:27  webPragmatist: so you're like effed
18:28  nick_h: can the Mac OS X usb stick that comes with the new MacBook Air be used to install Mac OS X on a MacBook Pro Core2Duo?
18:28  webPragmatist: there's nothing wrong with a tree view… apple just wanted to do it differently…
18:28  webPragmatist: and there's also nothing wrong with putting folders on the top
18:29  torchie: tree view?
18:29  webPragmatist: the thing that folds out
18:29 * LaraX doesn't hate webPragmatist
18:30  webPragmatist: thanks?
18:30 +LaraX: [01] 12:16:38 PM <zer0her0> webPragmatist: everyone hates you
18:30 +LaraX: :)
18:30  torchie: like this?
18:30  webPragmatist: ah
18:30  torchie: http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/066/901/original/tumblr_l7gtrdeL1x1qz7vibo1_500.png?1282420457
18:31  webPragmatist: ya
18:31  webPragmatist: but put that in a sidebar so you don't have to deal with all the folding where you are trying to find stuff
18:32  torchie: so this?
18:32  torchie: http://www.flyingcomputers.co.uk/images/TreeView.png
18:32  webPragmatist: no load
18:33  webPragmatist: anyway
18:39  webPragmatist: anyone know how to get rid of the stupid att000001 files in mail.app
18:39  webPragmatist: http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1947994
18:43  S_SubZero: so you compose an email in mail.app, attach anything, and when the recipient opens the mail with outlook they see that additional file?
18:45  webPragmatist: exchange i think throws all that bullcrap on there tbh
18:46  webPragmatist:   actually
18:46  webPragmatist: a better explaination is this
18:46  webPragmatist: exchange truncates anything past where you drop your attchment
18:46  webPragmatist: and throws it in the .htm file
18:46 --- luist_ is now known as luist
18:47  webPragmatist: it's one of those, it's exchange servers fault, so instead of writing a work around in the app we just pray everyday for decades and hope microsoft fixes it
