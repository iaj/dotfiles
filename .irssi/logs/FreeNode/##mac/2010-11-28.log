01:06  sr0z: This will annoy your co-workers: perl -e 'for (1..100){print "$_ "}' | say -v Victoria -f -
01:07  LordDragon: Victoria is sexy
01:07  LordDragon: :P
01:09  Kasm279: sr0z: why do you need perl for it?
01:10  sr0z: well we were messing with the speed at which victoria speaks the numbers
01:10  sr0z: got it up to 5000 but it was just gibberish
01:16  richardcavell: Does Windows have any equivalent of the 'say' command?
01:18  sr0z: Not that I know of anything built in. I remember Dr. Sbaitso way back using DOS
01:18 @ChrisAM: Microsoft Agent maybe
01:20  Kerline: Does osx requires a cd key ?
01:20 @ChrisAM: no
01:21  Kerline: Im wondering if it's okay to borrow a friend's cd
01:21 @ChrisAM: You lost yours?
01:22  S_SubZero: For a specific Mac, the DVD it comes with is intended only for use on that type of Mac.  So if you have an iMac and you try to use your friend's "for MacBook Pro" disc it will scold you and not run
01:22 @ChrisAM: You can call apple, give them your serial number, and for about $20, they will send you a replacement DVD set.
01:22  Kerline: I've tried an osx install DVD for mac-mini and it did just that
01:23  Kerline: Ok I think I'll do just that
01:23  S_SubZero: or you can just go to the store and get Snow Leopard for what, $29
01:23  Kerline: Oh really
01:23 @ChrisAM: That won't give you iLife and iWork though.
01:24  Kerline: I wAs under the impression it coated more
01:24  diffract|: i wish i could get a mac osx without iLife
01:25  Kerline: Ok thanks!
01:25 @ChrisAM: diffract| ... you can... just don't install it.
01:25  diffract|: ChrisAM: can i choose not to install it when i reinstall mac osx?
01:26 @ChrisAM: yep
01:30  peturi: How can i fix this ? http://alturl.com/45r7a
01:31  CPng|N1: ?
01:31 --- londonmet050_ is now known as lapmuser

01:32  peturi: Nobody is clicking my ads
01:32  CPng|N1: the humor
01:32  peturi: How can i fix that?
01:32  CPng|N1: I dont' see any ads
01:32  peturi: humor\humour .. us.vs.english
01:33  peturi: no?
01:33  peturi: Adblock?
01:33  diffract|: i do have adblock
01:33  peturi: Good
01:33  peturi: =>
01:33  peturi: Im so happy
01:33  diffract|: good for you
01:33  peturi: Now browse thro all my shit withotu clicking ads, it makes both of us happy
01:33  diffract|: i don't find your shit interesting
01:34 @ChrisAM: peturi ... do you have anything remotely on-topic here?
01:34  peturi: Yes, I do
01:35  diffract|: this channel is kinda weird today
01:41  Marctraider: mhh this is strange.
01:42 @ChrisAM: so's your face
01:42  Marctraider: Im both connected to the ethernet cable and wireless. but my wired network interface it set as primary. Now i was just browsing my windows share and it seemed really slow ( like wireless ) and when i turned off airport it suddenly went faster again.
01:43 @ChrisAM: can you see on the Windows side from which IP you were connected?
01:44 --- aL3x is now known as 13WAASGDR
01:45  Marctraider: so it was still using the airport for all communication.
01:45  Marctraider: chrisAM: ?
01:45  Marctraider: chrisAM: not so fast. But im positive it used the airport.
01:46 @ChrisAM: Was the ethernet cable connected when you mounted the share?
01:46 --- Bensawesome is now known as Bensawsome
01:46  Marctraider: lets see, the share was mounted when i was AC and when the ethernet cable was plugged in yes.
01:46 --- Bensawsome is now known as Guest90082
01:47  Marctraider: After that i went downstairs and automatically used airport and now im upstairs again with the cable plugged in. so i assumed it would automatically revert to that primary connection
01:47  Marctraider: All the time the share was mounted. but I find it weird it just doesnt use the wired connection again as primary, since i mounted it with the wired connection
01:49 @ChrisAM: guess it doesn't like to switch unless it has to.
01:49 @ChrisAM: it uses the last available connection
01:49  Marctraider: i see. well from now ill just turn off airport manually
01:49  Marctraider: :)
01:50 @ChrisAM: different programs handle it differently too.

02:05  zer0rez: abujasem: these are for work devices, not really wanting to jailbreak for one feature that was already there.
02:06  Kasm279: zer0rez: what happened?
02:07  zer0rez: Kasm279: 4.2 turns the rotation lock switch on the iPad to mute/unmute switch
02:07  Kasm279: is there another switch that used to mute/unmute?

02:18  diffract|: if bioshock was successfully ported to the mac and it is based off the unreal engine, why isn't there unreal development kit (udk) for mac?
02:19  zer0rez: diffract|: the UDK is much more then the engine
02:19  zer0rez: unreal engines have been running on mac for a while

02:39  gucko1: lx_laptop: I thought everthing on a mac "just works"!
02:39  lx_laptop: yeah no kidding
02:40  S_SubZero: what trouble?
02:40  abujasem: gucko1: nothing is perfect...even the Mac
02:40  lx_laptop: well, it turns on, I add a user test with password test
02:40  lx_laptop: and I try to login using my other mac, from within the same network
02:40  lx_laptop: and it says "user test is not allowed ftp"
02:41  gucko1: is there somekind of firewall?
02:41  lx_laptop: I have the server set as the dmz
02:41  lx_laptop: and the macs is supposed to be off
02:41  gucko1: abujasem: any idea?

02:42  abujasem: gucko1: I have no idea

02:44  CPng|N: there is a firewall, yes
02:44  lx_laptop: yeah, so
02:44  lx_laptop: when i log in it doesn't even ask me for my username and password
02:45  gucko1: maybe you should turn it off?
02:45  lx_laptop: it just says they are incorrect

03:04  spasticteapot: Is anyone here able to tell me how to figure out if I'm running 32 or 64 bit software?
03:05  spasticteapot: I'm trying to figure out what drivers I need for a latest-generation  macbook.
03:06  zer0her0: drivers?
03:06  zer0her0: for what?
03:06  spasticteapot: soundcard.
03:06  zer0her0: what soundcard?
03:06  spasticteapot: M-Audio USB.
03:07  spasticteapot: It has 32 and 64-bit drivers.
03:07  zer0her0: what app are you using it w/ ?
03:07  spasticteapot: None.
03:07  spasticteapot: they're generic soundcard drivers.
03:08  zer0her0: just for output?
03:08  Velociraptors: spasticteapot: http://www.askdavetaylor.com/snow_leopard_running_32_bit_64_bit_32bit_64bit.html will show you how to find which you use., down in the 2nd and third images, from system profiler
03:09  Velociraptors: spasticteapot: unless you've specifically picked 64bit sometime, 64bit kernel+extensions should be No
03:09 --- peshalto_ is now known as peshalto
03:09 @ChrisAM: spasticteapot ... Activity Monitor will tell you what is 64 bit
03:09  Velociraptors: (which is independent of whether you're running any 64 bit apps)
03:09 @ChrisAM: under Kind.. it will say either Intel or Intel (64 Bit)
03:10 @ChrisAM: spasticteapot ... I'm using the M-Audio Firewire drivers no problem here.
03:10  spasticteapot: velociraptors: That information isn't there.
03:11  spasticteapot: Is there a command line command?
03:11  Velociraptors: uname -a should show it, yeah
03:13 +Tomis: you're using the 32bit kernel spasticteapot 
03:13 +Tomis: any drivers should be universal anyway
03:15  spasticteapot: +Tomis: How do you know/
03:15  spasticteapot: ?
03:15  spasticteapot: I thought the C2D had 64-bit extensions.
03:15 +Tomis: easy, you're on a macbook
03:15 +Tomis: the kernel doesn't run 64bit on a macbook (yet)
03:15  spasticteapot: Ah.
03:16 +Tomis: it shouldn't matter though, they should just have one universal installer
03:16 +Tomis: if you're given the option, try 64bit first, if it's user-space driver, it'll run fine
03:17 +Tomis: if it's a kernel extension for some insane reason, then you'll probably need to go back and get the 32bit one
03:22  zer0her0: anyone have any suggestions for a pdf app to lower DPI?

03:34  aL3x: Tomis: not a geeky 14 year old
03:34  akiwiguy: in my part of it anyway
03:34  zer0her0: aL3x: yea found the filter

03:34  ErrantEgo: $9 a week on a paper route?
03:34  akiwiguy: yeah
03:34  aL3x: doing work for neighbors, like mowing the lawn, raking leaves, etc and then sometimes rural farm work
03:34  zer0her0: Tomis: not in the US
03:35  ErrantEgo: i can find $9 in change per week

03:37  akiwiguy: 6-core Mac Pro 
03:37 +Tomis: lol
03:37  Velociraptors: good choice :D
03:37  akiwiguy: or a 27" iMac
03:37 +Tomis: typical
03:37  akiwiguy: probably Mac Pro though
03:38 +Tomis: what would you be doing on it
03:38  akiwiguy: Steam, video editing, web browsing, app development
03:39 +Tomis: yea, you don't need the highest of the high-end for that
03:40  akiwiguy: and i want bragging rights
03:40  Velociraptors: bragging rights is the next 12-core the day it's released
03:40  Velociraptors: and that doesn't last long - or help much
03:40  akiwiguy: compiling the Linux Kernel in 10 minutes over 12 cores?
03:41  Velociraptors: (I once owned one of the fastest macs ever - the shiny wears off quick and then you just have a computer :)
03:41  akiwiguy: I had a Power Mac 6100/60 once
03:41  Velociraptors: it... should compile a whole load quicker than that. 
03:41  akiwiguy: Linux = FUCKING HUGE
03:41 +Tomis: who cares
03:41  akiwiguy: me
03:41  Velociraptors: was 10-15 minutes on my G4/1GHz!
03:41  akiwiguy: the full kernel?
03:42  akiwiguy: bullsh*t
03:42 +Tomis: you can't afford any mac
03:42  Velociraptors: yeah - compiled it for a Nubus Mac
03:42 +Tomis: and you're talking about needing a mac pro?
03:42 +Tomis: get real
03:42  akiwiguy: teehee
03:42  Velociraptors: curiously - a 6100/66 :)
03:42  akiwiguy: Cool
03:42 +Tomis: start with what you need at the bare minimum, then make your money with it, and when you hit its limit, upgrade
03:43  Velociraptors: probably disk-bound more than CPU, though
03:43  Velociraptors: at a guess
03:43  akiwiguy: yay, 3 minutes to go on my Snow Leopard install
03:43  akiwiguy: A basic Macbook would be good for me.
03:43  Velociraptors: ahhh - http://www.danaquarium.com/galleryalbums/beige/6100_serving.jpg
03:44  akiwiguy: cool
03:44  akiwiguy: mine had a CD drive
03:44  akiwiguy: Came with OS 9 - was so slow it wasnt funny
03:45  Velociraptors: that one used to, but replaced that with the Linux drive (still needed a small MacOS drive/partition to boot Linux at the time)
03:45 +Tomis: why does that mac has no mouse Velociraptors 
03:45 +Tomis: why does it has no GUI?!
03:45  aL3x: its white,plastic, with no glass over the screen..extra 200bux totally worth it
03:45 +Tomis: what did they do to her?!
03:45  Velociraptors: Tomis: Debian!
03:45  akiwiguy: it runs the best OS of all.
03:45  aL3x: for the metal, nice pro
03:45  akiwiguy: who needs a mouse when you have a CLI?
03:46  zer0her0: Velociraptors: not bad was hoping for a/ux
03:46  zer0her0: :)
03:46  akiwiguy: a/ux was EPIC
03:46  Velociraptors: :). It's a PPC, so no A/UX
03:46  akiwiguy: still prefer Rhapsody DR2 though
03:46  akiwiguy: or OS X Server 1.0
03:46  zer0her0: ah true
03:46  zer0her0: just glanced at the pic
03:47  akiwiguy: YAY it finished!
03:49  akiwiguy: damn
03:49  akiwiguy: hanging at a blinking cursor
03:50  akiwiguy: thats what i get for trying to get a mac on the cheap
03:52  zer0her0: yep
04:09  zer0her0: Velociraptors: what's that server do by the way?
04:09  Velociraptors: it used to host my sites
04:10  Velociraptors: It did well :). replaced with a black powermac after a year or so
04:11  zer0her0: hehe cool
04:16 --- aL3x_ is now known as alexlea

18:00  barfster: I have a MacBook 13" black
18:00  barfster: It is somewhat paralyzed, right SHIFT, backspace and a couple of more keys are not working.
18:02 @ChrisAM: you can pop them off and clean them out.
18:02 @ChrisAM: you could also open up the macbook and reseat the ribbon cable that connects the keyboard to the mainboard

18:06  jdahm: I'm wondering if it can insert line breaks automatically like emacs can be configured to do
18:09 @ChrisAM: never used it, sorry
18:17  barfster: ChrisAM: How?
18:17  barfster: Pop them out? using a table fork? From which direction?
18:17 +Branes: barfster: have a look at www.ifixit.com ... they've got all manner of Mac pull-apart guides
18:18  barfster: How can I make screenshots of a movie in MacOS X?
18:18  barfster: +opt+shift+4 only gives me a checkerboard
18:18 +Branes: barfster: usually, though, when a group of keys have stopped working, it usually means part of the mylar matrix has failed, and the only fix is a whole new keyboard.
18:19 +Branes: Cmd-Shift-3 is the basic screen-capture
18:19  barfster: Branes: Thanks, that’s what I expect
18:19  barfster: Branes: But it does not make an impression when there are movies playing
18:20  barfster: There is a "curse" to be written in terminal however that makes a screendump of everything even when there is qt content on the screen
18:20 +Branes: buggered if I know what that might be, then. No terminal here.
18:21 @ChrisAM: I was off finding the right link.... do up to step 12 in this guide: http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Repair/Installing-MacBook-Core-2-Duo-Logic-Board-Replacement/528/1
18:27  barfster: cmd + opt + shift + 4
18:27  barfster: I usually use
18:27  barfster: 3 is if you want the full screen
18:28  barfster: To also capture video, obviously a still of the video: /usr/sbin/screencapture

18:38  sgfgdf: hello guys, why does apple lets to use the Find My iPhone feature for free only with iPhone 4?
18:41  barfster: sgfgdf: probably has something to do with the way the gps thing is built?
18:43  sgfgdf: barfster: but the ability to wipe your phone if you loose it has nothing to do with the gps, right? and people will be grateful if they can do it for free with their 3G(S).
18:44  sgfgdf: btw, does this wipe only delete sthe files by letting them to be restored from the hdd, or it overwrites the data?
18:44  sgfgdf: *the files
18:54 +Branes: Remote Wipe essentially bricks the phone, it erases *everything*
18:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraX]
18:56  barfster: sgfgdf: Sure, but I think it’s a totally different method to be used on older iPhones, compared to the new.
18:57  sgfgdf: Branes: yes but if you erase a file from your computer it is only marked as deleted and eventually the space it occupies could be overwritten when creating new files. so if you don't create new files that information still could be accessed.
18:57  sgfgdf: barfster: what is the difference?
18:58  barfster: I am not sure, but I believe the GPSes are different from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4 and therfore also the method to make it happen.
19:00  sgfgdf: barfster: but isn't the remote wipe is done by the newtwork (3G, EDGE...) you have on your phone? or you talk about finding the phone ever the GPS?
19:00 +Branes: sgfgdf: I said erase, not delete.
19:02 +Branes: In any case, once the handset has been sent the wipe command, it needs a fresh OS installed, and in the process memory is zeroed anyway.
19:02  barfster: ADSL, SDSL, ATM, 4G, 3G, EDGE what is really the difference? It’s just proprietary names of our infrastrukture
19:02  sgfgdf: Branes: i can only guess what people means when they said erase. so you claim that the data is overwritten by doing the remote wipe?
19:02 +Branes: It's not like there's any data recovery software for iOS anyway.
19:02  barfster: phones has IMEIs similar to MAC addresses for the phone network.
19:04  sgfgdf: Branes: so it has its own separate file system?
19:05 +Branes: Totally. There's no disk-mode in iOS-based devices.

19:14  sgfgdf: barfster: what will this shutting down exactly do on the phone?
19:14  barfster: It will be locked by the phonecompany
19:15  sgfgdf: barfster: and this locking will cause...?
19:15  barfster: It will then have to be brought in for service
19:15 +Branes: It blows a semiconductor fuse inside the base-band chip, rendering the handset completely useless and irrepairable.
19:15  barfster: Or better, the phone company can track down the phone.
19:15  barfster: if they feel like it.
19:18  sgfgdf: barfster: how does this locking is done? i mean if the phone is down or if there is no sim card?
19:19  sgfgdf: barfster: if my phone is sim unlocked and i can use different carriers i should talk with the company which sell me the phone right?
19:20  barfster: Yes
19:20  barfster: They can track down the phone
19:20 +Branes: All phones transmit their IMEI as soon as they are turned on, and all networks will abide by an IMEI disable request, so it doesn't matter which company it is with. There does not need to be a SIM pesent.
19:20  barfster: There are also methods for turning the phone off.
19:21  barfster: Not like power off, but render it useless
19:21  barfster: Or in the case of iPhone; turning it into an iPod touch.
19:26  sgfgdf: Branes: if they send an disable request and you find the phone eventually can you unlock it and use it then?
19:26 +Branes: Not an iPhone.
19:27  sgfgdf: Branes: so if you stop the phone it is stopped forever?
19:28 +Branes: It blows the base-band chip. Without it, it has no phone capabilities ever.
19:29  sgfgdf: Branes: if you care about the data on the phone, does such an disable request will prevent from using your personal data?
19:30 +Branes: Why so paranoid? Why all the questions?
19:33  barfster: Any automator experts on here today? I am making a service Resizing images for publishing to a newspaper, I have made all 5 sizes as each their service, however this is doing the job 5 times in my opinion. Is there a way to copy finder items 5 times and to a controll renaming for each of them?
19:33  sgfgdf: Branes: because.. people are paranoid, or at least some of them. some of them have information that they don't pretend to be so important, but some of them have sensitive information such as some passcodes or other.
19:38 +Branes: Then you'd be an idiot to leave sensitive information on a device that is easily lost/stolen and does not have built-in encryption.
19:38  sgfgdf: Branes: it is a matter of viewpoint. some want to know if they put something sensitive will it remains private or not, because if not they won't put such an information on their phones at all. it is not a crime to educate yourself about the technologies you use, right?
19:38  sgfgdf: Branes: you see, if i didn't asked you i would be an idiot.
19:39  sgfgdf: Branes , barfster : thanks for the help!
19:41  sgfgdf: probably the business class people won't consider using the iPhone so far unless there is an enryption option on the horizon.

20:00  fujisan: are the mac mini's reliable as servers?
20:01  S_SubZero: fujisan: http://www.macminicolo.net/
20:01  S_SubZero: ask these guys
20:02  fujisan: Mini is really a reliable machine thanks to Amiga way of engineering, the most heat producing , trouble potential part is external, easily replaceable. << that's what i read somewhere, and i was wondering why Apple put the the psu back into the new minis?
20:03 @ChrisAM: reliable, yes. powerful, no.
20:04  fujisan: i mean seems to me like the best thing is that the psu is external with the older models
20:04 @ChrisAM: This is from Apple's documentation: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1084/5147937639_d0c3dc5d69_o.png
20:04  fujisan: i wonder why Apple decided to put the psu back into the new minis
20:04  S_SubZero: well that is an 8-core Xserve.
20:05 @ChrisAM: Apple's not leaving many options since discontinuing the XServes.
20:05  fujisan: yeah
20:06 @ChrisAM: Someone running a rack-dense infrastructure probably isn't too keen on replacing 1U servers with huge-ass Mac Pros.
20:07  fujisan: yeah i guess so
20:07  fujisan: i saw they are selling 1TB SSD's now
20:07  fujisan: 2600 dollars or so
20:08 @ChrisAM: aiee
20:08  fujisan: little steep still :)
20:10 @ChrisAM: NewEgg's cheapest is $3,150.
20:10  fujisan: wow
20:10  fujisan: i wonder how fast they'll go down in price
20:11  fujisan: 20-50% per year 
20:12 @ChrisAM: Maybe it will follow a similar pattern as RAM prices: http://www.jcmit.com/memoryprice.htm
20:13  fujisan: yeah perhaps
20:13  fujisan: hmz no prices for DDR ram :)
20:13  fujisan: DDR3*
20:14 * Branes wouldn't trust any SSD
20:15  fujisan: Branes same here i still use dvd's to make incremental backups
20:15  fujisan: spreading the risk :)
20:15  fujisan: and i can still search all my files thanks to catalog apps
20:16  Jarvis: Branes: how come? WWL ?
20:18  fujisan: Branes so what do you think about an external psu versus an internal one?
20:18 +Branes: Jarvis: The technology is inherently flawed.
20:19  Jarvis: Branes: in what way ?
20:19  fujisan: Branes you mean intentionally flawed for economic purposes :)
20:19  fujisan: ?
20:19 +Branes: The process of flipping a bit requires heat, and it is heat that kills the cell.
20:20  Jarvis: aye true, but compared to say a normal spin drive, surely the MTBF on the SSD's is going to be somewhat less than the spin drive, -- if the Wear write levelling does what itsmeant to anyways
20:21  Jarvis: *somewhat better 
20:21  Jarvis: i suppose it all depends on what your using the drive for
20:21  Jarvis: i wouldn't like to use an SSD for swap :/
20:21  fujisan: can you use a SSD as ram?
20:22  Jarvis: as physical ram? no
20:22  fujisan: Jarvis: i mean is that what you mean by swap?
20:22  superkop: I've been using an Intel X25-M as my OS drive for 14 months now. Haven't noticed anything except things running a bit faster.
20:22  Jarvis: fujisan: swapfile / pagefile = Virtual Memmory 
20:22  fujisan: Jarvis: yeah 
20:22  fujisan: i know
20:22  fujisan: so if you have a SSD you can use it for swap
20:23  fujisan: and why wouldnt that be so great then?
20:23  Jarvis: yea , but you'd end up killing it a lot quicker .
20:23  fujisan: oh ok
20:24  fujisan: it would be better if the drive works like the titanic where the entire drive wont fail if some parts get physically damaged, may sound silly, but that's because i've no technical background ;)
20:26  Jarvis: fujisan: only issue i can see with that is - the titanic sank..
20:27  fujisan: yeah that's only because the concept doesn't work too well with large boats in the Arctic where you have giant icebergs
20:28  fujisan: same as with the Hindenburg zeppelin they filled it with highly flammable hydrogen
20:28  fujisan: but the concept of a zeppelin is still nice
20:29  fujisan: i mean it's a pitty they don't offer traveling in zeppelins anymore
20:29  fujisan: Germany is producing zeppelins again. More than 70 years after the infamous Hindenburg disaster, its latest airship was gently guided out of the hangar doors last month to make its maiden test flight. :)
20:31 +Branes: Cunard Line should get into building airships.
20:31  S_SubZero: the day I can go across the Atlantic in a zeppelin will be quite the day (and more like a week)
20:32  fujisan: and they fly at low altitude 4,000 ft instead of 35,000 ft and use less fuel but travel slower though nice for touristic traveling 
20:32  fujisan: it takes 43 hours now S_SubZero 
20:33  fujisan: they travel at ~125 mph
20:33  fujisan: similar speed to highspeed train
20:33  S_SubZero: I'd want the entire retro adventure
20:33  fujisan: :D
20:33  fujisan: ye me too
20:33  S_SubZero: stay at some steampunk-laced 19th century themed hotel
20:34  fujisan: yeah i adore steampunk it's the reason why i like zeppelins
20:34 +Branes: ewww
20:34  fujisan: :D
20:34 +Branes: Steampunk is what happens when goths discover brown.
20:35  fujisan: S_SubZero:  have you ever seen the movie: "Vidocq" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164961/ it features some great steampunk?

20:50  fujisan: which kind ?
20:50  superkop: Mac mini from 2008. Warranty expired a month ago...
20:50  barfster: I have one of those too
20:50  fujisan: so you have apple care?
20:50  barfster: Mac Mini from april 2008
20:51  fujisan: how can the warranty be expired if you had apple care apple care + normal warranty is  years
20:51 +Branes: fuji, there isn't a public access site for stolen serial numbers of Apple goodies.
20:51  fujisan: 3 years
20:51  superkop: I've had issues with random hardware "disappearing" only to reappear after a reboot or sometimes just after a while. Happened first to audio device and DVD drive, and later with the harddrive.
20:51  fujisan: oh ok Branes
20:52 +Branes: superkop: If you're game, open it up and clean out any trace of dust, and also clean and re-apply thermal compound to all heatsinks.
20:53  superkop: Yeah, I've been looking into the various spatula/screwdriver approaches to popping it open. If I can't get it back up I'll have to do that. Just a pain in the butt to do.
20:56  fujisan: superkop your nick looks kinda dutch :o
20:57  fujisan: superkop aren't there instruction vids of how to open it up similar to this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2CExAXtnis
20:58  superkop: Yeah, I've seen some videos.
20:58  superkop: I'll try rebooting it now, it's dead.
20:58  fujisan: oh ok gl
21:01  superkop: Now I'm just getting a black screen (signal, but black). sigh...
21:01  superkop: I guess I can add graphics adapter to the list of disappearing (and hopefully reappearing) devices.
21:10 +Branes: considering the GPU is part of the main chipset (MCP79), I'd say that is where the fault lies, as *everything* intersects there.
21:21  superkop: Disconnected power for a couple of minutes and rebooted. It seems to be working again. :s
21:21  EdLin: Branes: thanks for telling him the bad news, what is a cheap part in a PC, the motherboard, is the most expensive part in an Apple computer.
21:21  EdLin: er, I mean "logicboard"
21:21  EdLin: I sound bitter because I am, I was presented with a $384 bill for a mac mini logicboard, and that's the cheapest one, merely 13 months after I bought it.
21:22  EdLin: right out of warrenty.
21:22 * Jarvis tickles Gatewayy 
21:22 +Branes: superkop: definitely sounds like a thermal issue.
21:22  Jarvis: wtf ...
21:22  CPng|N: did everyone see all that just appear in 1 second?
21:23  fujisan: EdLin:  so couldnt you like buy warranty on ebay for it after 13 months?
21:23  EdLin: fujisan: applecare is only available when still in warrenty.
21:23  Shadow__1: hey guys if i have a question about os x server is this the right channel?
21:23  fujisan: from apple yes but i see these deals for applecare on ebay all the time

21:24  EdLin: fujisan: I don't know how that could work either, I still was bringing it to an Apple store.
21:25  fujisan: EdLin:  so the moral of your story is to always buy Apple Care?
21:25  EdLin: fujisan: yeah, except then you'd be paying $1,000 for that mac mini.
21:25  fujisan: EdLin:  the new ones come with the psu internal
21:26  fujisan: so i guess its wise to do that anyways

22:49  barfster: In Finder press cmd + shift + g type in /tmp/
22:49  barfster: and see if there is anything TextMatish in there.
22:51 * LordDragon orders some viagra for flaccid 
22:51 * barfster wonders why flaccid doesn’t save his files.
22:52  barfster: echo -n "" > /tmp/myfile.txt
22:52  barfster: then edit.
22:52  barfster: but most of the time, don’t you just copy a file you already made and make some changes?
22:55  flaccid: there is something called human error, where you forgot to save. none of the above is going to help in that situation.
23:07  EdLin: barfster: you can just use touch(1) rather than that echo -n trick.
23:07  Necrosan: touch should work
23:07  EdLin: barfster: if touch doesn't detect a file, it creates one.
23:08  EdLin: Necrosan: I have the feeling that the echo -n "" hack is from someone who did REM > FOO.TXT in MS-DOS
23:08  Necrosan: EdLin: sounds like it =P
23:09  flaccid: barfster: also no reason to use " quotes and do interpolation if there is no variable being quoted
23:09  flaccid: in bash you can also just do :> /tmp/myfile.txt
23:09  flaccid: hmm stupid smiley screwing up chars
