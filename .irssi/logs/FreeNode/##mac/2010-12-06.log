00:06  alexlea: i didnt watch it
00:07  alexlea: i started to, cause i had typed ferret vs rat, with the intention of finding pros and cons about them as pets...not a litera battle

01:45  semitones: except in a vm
01:56 +rorx: semitones: some people claim it doesn't properly handle thermal managenent.
01:57  semitones: is there authoritative evidence on the matter?
01:58 +Branes: Nothing Apple will admit to. They know, but they're protecting proprietry information.
01:59 +Branes: Besides, it's not a thermal issue, it's a voltage control issue.

02:09 +Branes: It's partly that which accounts for the big gains in battery-life.
02:10 +rorx: makes me wonder if these alt OS's handle things any better with the G5's SPU.
02:10 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 124 seconds
02:11 +Branes: The SPU is almost as brain-dead as the SMC, but it is fairly well documented.
02:11  wastrel: hey i pulled the drive out of my dead macbook, and have it mounted as a usb drive on my new macbook, trying to import the stuff with migration assistant but it isn't working, keeps prompting for password and then doing nothing
02:12 +Branes: wastrel: The best time to run Migration Assistant is during the setup run after a full re-installation of the OS onto a bare drive.
02:12  wastrel: Branes: yeah i didn't have the drive enclsure then :/
02:13 +rorx: Branes: hmm, then I wonder why apple wouldn't document the SMC interface as well. I still haven't bought a mactel, does apple even release hardware technotes like they always did with PowerMac?
02:13  wastrel: so i just need to manually import photos and itunes stuff?
02:13 +Branes: If your new MacBook's primary account is using the same short-name as the one on the old drive, Migration Assistant won't work.
02:14 +Branes: It's not smart enough to merge accounts, if that's what you were hoping for.
02:14  wastrel: yeah the usernames are the same and the uid is too 
02:15  wastrel: that's basically what i wanted
02:15  wastrel: ok so the manual route 
02:15 +Branes: If you're not prepared to start over, and/or you don't want to lose what you've got on your new machine's account, you'll need to pull them over manually and chown them.
02:17  ccg: maybe you can change the username in the old mac
02:22 +Branes: ccg: one problem. "i pulled the drive out of my dead macbook ..."

03:35  LordDragon: bsdbandit, insert cd, reboot and hold the "C" key down after the chime until it starts loading from the cd
03:35  LordDragon: or you can hold the "option" key after the chime and get a bootloader screen and choose the cd from that
03:36  bsdbandit: ok 
03:36  bsdbandit: cool

03:58  Kasm279: evilbug: probably not a lot
03:58  Kasm279: depending on where th water is
03:58  evilbug: Kasm279: on the keyboard and screen.

Should I be worried and get some sort of skin for it, or can I be sure the letters on the keyboard won't fadeaway?
08:53  shuaib: Any experiences to share?
08:54 +Tomis2: try cleaning the keyboard?
08:54 +Tomis2: the letters are clear plastic, it's not like they're going to wear off
08:55  shuaib: I do clean the keyboard regularly. But given the heavy usage, the keys are showing some signs of damage. 
08:56  shuaib: Nothing significant, but better be careful in advance
08:56 +Tomis2: there are covers you can get, i wouldn't bother, too much hassle
08:57  shuaib: That's true.
08:57  S_SubZero: my MBP had a shiny spot on the keyboard two hours after I got it out of the box.  It's just a thing

08:58 +Tomis2: the letters on my old ibook are wearing off
08:59 +Tomis2: but i don't imagine that will happen on the backlit ones

09:44 +Tomis2: i wouldn't expect it to
09:44 +Tomis2: though some apps may not check both locations, so who knows

13:04  MobGod: i have a dumb ? if i want to compress say 100 files and i do a command a to select all how do i change the name of the zip file bc all it does is make a archive.zip or is there a better way to do this ?
13:06  MobGod: well also to make 100 files that is 300 megs smaller
13:08  Angostura: Ummm - rename archive.zip once it has completed?
13:08  js_: exactly :)
13:09  js_: or get nerdy and mess around with applescript/cli

13:22  MobGod: to make the files smaller i did command a to select all 320megs than zip and its the same size still

13:27  Angostura: What type of files?
13:28  MobGod: they are apk's
13:28  MobGod: but like 100 of them
13:29  MobGod: brb one sec
13:30  Angostura: apks - are already compressed, are they not. 
13:30  Angostura: In which case, it is hardly surprising that they cannot be compressed further
13:31  MobGod: oh ok so if I have 300 megs of apk's its going to stay 300 ??
13:34  Angostura: I'm guessing that it is compressed already, so yes - unless you can find something with an amazing compression algo
13:35  MobGod: ok

17:22 +Tomis: not by design
17:23 +Tomis: some of the manufacture's use solutions which are compatible
17:23 +Tomis: but there is no standard, so you really should stick with one manufacturer if you need to extend a wireless network

18:17  veronicamars: or is it just that installing a lot of apps slows things down?
18:18  ahihi: is the external drive faster?
18:18  veronicamars: i dunno 480 MB/s
18:18  veronicamars: i dunno how to lookup rpm on drives though
18:20  ahihi: by opening up the case :P
18:20  ahihi: but yeah, fresh installations are often somewhat faster
18:21  veronicamars: you think that apps like vmware slow things down
18:23  ahihi: I don't really know if it's specific apps that cause it or just general file system fragmentation
18:24  veronicamars: yeah
18:24  ahihi: which isn't supposed to be much of a problem with hfs+ but that's not always true
18:24  veronicamars: my other system got rather slow
18:24  veronicamars: now that i've done the fresh install i really notice the difference
18:25  veronicamars: apps just start faster

22:18 +Branes: fujisan: it can't, and there isn't really a tool available to do that. What you have to do is use WinClone to back up your bootcamp partition to a .dmg. If you then use Boot Camp Assistant to make a partition on a new drive, after it is done choose 'install later' and then use WinClone to transfer the contents back to the Boot Camp partition from the .dmg
