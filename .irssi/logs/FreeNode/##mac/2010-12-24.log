00:26  jdahm: hey I have speakers that are USB. I'd like to play over airtunes to the spekers.  I can't hook them up to the airport express I have.  Is it possible to "share" speakers over OS X/iTunes. So if I have amac mini, plug them in to that computer and play from another computer thru them?

01:19 +numberz: so here's my thinking. i have a guy who i want to give basic access to an os x box. I don't know this guy at all. I created a standard account. removed him from staff and put him in a new group. chmod'd everything i could think of. he doesn't have admin or sudo privs... i should be ok right?
01:21  richardcavell: yeah
01:23 +remyo: LaraX: How goes it?
01:23 +remyo: Late Christmas shopping at the Apple Store was freaking insane 
01:24 @LaraX: remyo: I just downloaded http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs (10.0.614.0 canary build) to try it, but it's only for PCs I think
01:24 @LaraX: I can imagine
01:25 +remyo: LaraX: I have a couple of PC's around, I can try it
01:25 +remyo: Plus I'm sure theres a virtualbox build
01:25 +remyo: Thanks
01:27 @LaraX: you're welcome... it started with me downloading Chrome beta to try http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/ because it said you needed that, this site still didn't work, then irccloud stopped working, so I found this. now irccloud works again but this site still doesn't
01:27 +remyo: Skype has also been funky lately 
01:28 @LaraX: I don't use it. why not Google Voice/video chat?
01:28 +remyo: I do
01:28 +remyo: But I also Skype. 
01:28 @LaraX: is it better?
01:28 +remyo: Google Voice is actually pretty insane. I've been using it to do free texting from my iphone
01:29 @LaraX: yeah me too, except I need to use it with someone who goes out of the country a lot, it doesn't work and keeps freezing her BlackBerry :|
01:29 +remyo: Yikes, wanna try it with me?
01:29 @LaraX: well it works when she's in the US but maybe we can sometime :)
01:30 @LaraX: I have two accounts/numbers, waiting to be able to import a number to start giving it out a lot
01:30 +remyo: (404) 981-8350 is my Google Voice number 
01:30 @LaraX: oh that's the one that shows up in Gmail right?
01:30 @LaraX: because there are two numbers
01:31 +remyo: I just know of that one
01:31 @LaraX: if you do it from Gmail it shows some generic number that everyone gets or shares the area code, if you do it from the Google Voice page it's the one you chose or something
01:32 * LaraX is googling
01:32 +remyo: I've actually just been using it through the iPhone app
01:33 +remyo: Suppose I could use the website but I don't
01:35 @LaraX: oh 404 is Atlanta, nevermind. there's another similar one I'm thinking of
01:38 @LaraX: "On the receiving end, when you get a text message from Gmail on your phone, it will come from a number in the 406 area code. (The l33t folks in the crowd will note that this spells G0O.)" http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/really-new-in-labs-this-time-sms-text.html
01:50  jdahm: ChrisAM: thanks!
01:50 @ChrisAM: yep
01:50  jdahm: exactly what I was looking fr
01:51  jdahm: (why is that not built into the OS yet?)
01:53 +remyo: LadySerena: Na, 404 is in fact Atlanta 
01:54 +remyo: Ah, sorry

04:01  Nexus74: hello
04:01  Nexus74: anyone know if it's beneficial to reinstall the macOS on my iMac ever so often?
04:01  Nexus74: I used to do this about every 6 months back in my PC days
04:01  Swian: I always do that
04:02  Swian: keeps it fresh and snappy
04:02  Nexus74: Do you find  you mac runs faster
04:02  Nexus74: oh ok
04:02  Swian: I do
04:02  Nexus74: hmmm
04:02  Swian: on PC more so
04:02  Swian: but on mac too
04:02 @ChrisAM: I usually reinstall each year... before & after I go to a security conference.
04:02  Nexus74: Not sure I see as much of a difference as I did on my PC
04:02  Swian: no, not as much
04:02  Nexus74: A security conference
04:02  Nexus74: ?
04:03  Swian: on PC the registry gets fragmented and slows things down
04:03  Nexus74: amen
04:03  Swian: you can run CCleaner to help that
04:03  Nexus74: Well on my mac I run Onyx periodically
04:03  Swian: but I still wipe it every so often
04:03  Nexus74: ok.  I thought it may have been an OCD thing with me...lol
04:03  Swian: nah
04:03  Nexus74: I have the magic pad
04:03  Swian: nut I have a bit of that too
04:04  Swian: so don't quote me
04:04  Nexus74: If I completely wipe and reinstall, will I be able to do it with magic pad?
04:04  Swian: yeah? a guy at work has that, its cool
04:04  Nexus74: I just don't want to get stuck on the install with the mPad
04:04  Swian: dunno
04:04  Swian: I don't have one
04:05  Nexus74: I think wiping clean and reinstalling has deeper psych implicatins as well
04:05  Nexus74: for me
04:05  Nexus74: but oh well, this isnt psychology 101
04:05  Swian: makes me feel better
04:05  Nexus74: Good, I'm not the only one
04:05  Swian: but I like configuring machines
04:05  Nexus74: yes, I always click off all the language and font optins as well
04:05  Swian: yep
04:06  Swian: just wiped the iMac not long ago
04:06  Swian: like 2 weeks back
04:06  Nexus74: my imac is now over four years old
04:06  Swian: my iMac is a G4 1.25ghz
04:06  Nexus74: I had brought it with Tiger
04:06  Swian: the mushroom one
04:06  Nexus74: whoa
04:06  Nexus74: mushroom?
04:06  Swian: white dome shaped
04:06  Swian: 20" monintor on the pole
04:06  Nexus74: oh, wow...power pc chip
04:07  Swian: yeah
04:07  Nexus74: that's gong back
04:07  Swian: G4
04:07  Nexus74: what OS are u running now?
04:07  Swian: 10.5
04:08  Swian: as far as it will go
04:08  Nexus74: wow, that's pretty recent
04:08  Swian: yep
04:08  Nexus74: current snow leopard is 10.6.5
04:08  Swian: yep running that on this
04:08  Nexus74: how does it perform?
04:08  Swian: its not screaming but its ok
04:08  Nexus74: time to upgrade
04:09  Swian: I did
04:09  Swian: not on that now
04:09  Swian: its next to me
04:09  Nexus74: ah...wha'd ya get?
04:09  Swian: Mac Mini
04:09  Nexus74: nice
04:09  alexlea: i agree about psych implications. However, if you aren't using an uninstaller app,a fresh install gets rid of a lot plist, and the preference files, that are just sitting there. Even with an uninstaller, some stuff stays behindâ€¦so if you install and reinstall a lot of software, a fresh install can get rid of a lot of junk. Otherwise, the only advantage of a fresh install is it defrays the drive (but you can get that effect by cloning to
04:09  alexlea:  another disk, then cloning back)
04:09  Swian: amen alexlea
04:09  Nexus74: i agree
04:10  Nexus74: I noticed alot of folders that got left behind as a result of previous apps uninstalled
04:10  Nexus74: that alone made me wanna install
04:10  Swian: I try and run lean and mean, but still you get junk
04:10  alexlea: thats what drove me to do a fresh install last week. It had been over a year. The performance is the same tho...which means, a reinstall really wasnt necessary...but nevertheless
04:11  Swian: yeah
04:11  Swian: but it makes me feel better
04:11  Nexus74: something about starting with a clean slate that attracts me... the computer is where i spend most of my time...so analgous to my life....strarting over?
04:11  Nexus74: yup..I think wayyy to much
04:12  alexlea: also, i did a reinstall cause i had installed homebrew, macports, xcode, etc...and i NEVER use any of that stuff
04:12  Nexus74: yup. start with bar min and only install as I need to
04:13  alexlea: this time, before the reinstall, i zero-ed out the drive..so it felt like an extra clean fresh start...lol
04:13  Nexus74: yeah, I like to do that, but man, that can be time consuming...hours
04:13  Swian: yeah, hard core
04:14  alexlea: it took a little under 2 ours for me, for a 320 gb drive
04:14  alexlea: hours*
04:14  Swian: that's not bad
04:14  Nexus74: that's not bad really.  You must of selected the lowest zero out opton?
04:14  Nexus74: option
04:15  Swian: some of the zero options on UBCD take ALL DAY
04:15  alexlea: to zero out, then like 20 min to install...then another 2 hours to get my movies, music, etc back on...then, a day of intermittent settings tweaking
04:15  Swian: yeah, tweaking takes time
04:16  Swian: wb
04:16  Nexus74: what do you guys use for your IRC client
04:16  Nexus74: lol thx
04:16  Swian: Xchat aqua
04:16  Nexus74: Colloquy here, its a little quirky
04:16  Swian: yep
04:16  Swian: that's why I don't use it
04:17  Nexus74: I have to type in a room to get connected
04:17  Nexus74: then I can choose from one of my favs
04:17  Swian: I use X-Chat on linux and Windows
04:17  alexlea: limechat and macirssi
04:17  Swian: I like cross platform
04:17  alexlea: Nexus74: you can tweak it; under server properties, check the boxthat says open up console on launch
04:17  Swian: thunderbird for mail on all platform
04:18  Swian: s
04:18  Nexus74: alexlea, where's that option?
04:18  alexlea: i believe yu click sever in menu bar, then right click freenode and click properties...and that is where the setting is...not 100% sure
04:18  Nexus74: i'll try
04:19  Swian: X-chat aqua is not exactly like x-chat but damn close
04:19  Swian: so its very much the same on all OSs
04:19  Nexus74: found it..thx
04:20  alexlea: Nexus74: yw...tho i htink i misunderstood, and that you actually need to check something about "connect when opening", either way, server properties will have most of teh stuff colloquy hdes form you
04:20  Nexus74: yup..I saw that too
04:22  Nexus74: wonder how hard it would be to code my own client
04:23 --- Caprica is now known as Caprica-afk
04:23  alexlea: Nexus74: depends...do you code at all?
04:23  Nexus74: yes
04:23  Nexus74: Played around with Objective-C, Actionscript and a little PHP
04:24  alexlea: Nexus74: i would first try donloding source code for irc clients that areopen source, ie. limechat and textual (whch copied limechat), macirssi has code, along wiht irssi...and i think xchat aqua might  even have source code version too, not sure
04:24  Nexus74: I agree.  That's a significant investment in time to start from scratch
04:26  Nexus74: well, I don't think I can resist anymore...must....re...install...OS
04:27  Nexus74: I will see you guys soon
04:28  Nexus74: thanks for the advice
04:29  alexlea: have fun lol

07:32  richardcavell: ha
07:32  richardcavell: nice saving
07:32  richardcavell: OS X tends not to bloat though
07:32  richardcavell: unlike Windows
07:32  richardcavell: one of the reasons is that it keeps all the essential files in the one place
07:33  richardcavell: so you can uninstall proper
07:33  Nexus74: I was surprised.  Snow Leopard only used 4.85 gig
07:33  Nexus74: Of course, I clicked off all unneeded languages and printer drivers
07:34  richardcavell: yeah
07:34  richardcavell: some things can just bloat
07:34  richardcavell: I installed Creative Suite 5 for a friend of mine last night
07:34  richardcavell: Photoshop plus some other doodads
07:34  richardcavell: Gigs and gigs and gigs of bloat
07:35  Nexus74: Yup...
07:35  richardcavell: I pity the poor buggers who had to code each line of it
07:35  Nexus74: Adobe adds a lot
07:35  Nexus74: I would love to see that code
07:35  Nexus74: just to see it
07:35  richardcavell: Well one line of source code turns into like 5 bytes of instructions
07:35  richardcavell: So to come up with gigs....
07:35  Nexus74: how do a bunch of 1s and 0s get converted to beautiful graphics..
07:36  Nexus74: doesn't that depend upon the programming language and the compiler?
07:36  Nexus74: or is "one line of source = 5 bytes" pretty much the same across the board
07:36  Nexus74: ?
07:36  richardcavell: well depends how spaced out your code is
07:36  richardcavell: of course
07:36  richardcavell: but with modern optimization, a line of code may be optimised away entirely
07:37  Nexus74: are you a programmer?
07:37  richardcavell: yeah
07:37  richardcavell: not professionally
07:37  Nexus74: cool.  what langauges?

07:37  Nexus74: Right now, I have a project going.  Connecting Flash to Drupal / Ubercart
07:37  Nexus74: Actionscript and PHP mainly
07:38  richardcavell: ok
07:38  Nexus74: fooled around with ObjectiveC
07:38  Nexus74: I'm having trouble sending an array as one variable to PHP
07:39  Nexus74: PHP is only seeing one value of the array...
07:39  Nexus74: but i'll figure it out...
07:39  Nexus74: that's what I love about programming, getting those Eureka! moments
07:40  Nexus74: Do you know of a good PHP / HTML editor for mac?  I have Dreamweaver, but don't want to install it

07:42  richardcavell: gee, no I don't
07:42  richardcavell: last time I edited HTML I used Notepad
07:43  Nexus74: lol..are you on mac?
07:45  Nexus74: html editing on notepad...the hardcore way
07:45  Nexus74: now that's straight coding...no gui there

07:49  Nexus74: Southron, how lightweight is it?
07:49  Southron: Nexus74: hmmmmm, I don't think it's very lightweight...
07:50  Nexus74: that's what's keeping me from installing Dreamweaver...over kill for simply editing PHP files
07:50  Southron: I've messed with it a little, but I use BBEdit and prefer it.
07:50  Southron: Nexus74: Ah, well in comparison to that, I think it's not bad :)
07:51  Nexus74: prolly right
07:51  Nexus74: BBEdit..freeware?
07:51  Southron: Nah -- Text Wrangler is the free version from the same folks.
07:51  Southron: I don't know if it does code colouring
07:52  Southron: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11009/textwrangler

07:52  Nexus74: Yes it does, at least for C
07:52  SNIa: http://macromates.com/
07:53  SNIa: ah nm, its not free
07:53  Southron: Yeah, SNIa, textmate isn't free, but it's plenty powerful and feels light on its feet.
07:53  Nexus74: 30 day trial tho
07:53  Nexus74: looks like text wrangler is free
07:54  Southron: it is

07:57  profxavier: anyone willing to assist setting this up ?

08:01  profxavier: IPP ?
08:01  profxavier: LPD ?
08:03  profxavier: sorry, also, what is the difference between my driver with model #CX5000 and Epson Stylus CX5000 - Gutenprint

08:15  Nexus74: profxavier, does your printer have a mac driver?
08:16  profxavier: yes
08:16  Nexus74: have you installed it?
08:16  profxavier: i believe so
08:16  profxavier: but my printer is not directly attached to my Mac
08:17  profxavier: i ran a .dmg, which is the driver, and I can select the two mentioned before, as drivers for the printer
08:17  profxavier: my driver with model #CX5000 and Epson Stylus CX5000 - Gutenprint
08:17  Nexus74: restart the mac and the printer
08:17  Nexus74: restart the printer first
08:18  profxavier: sorry?
08:18  profxavier: why would I do that ?
08:18  Nexus74: when printer is completely booted, restart the mac
08:18  profxavier: i would prefer to correctly configure my printer
08:19  profxavier: not restart it and my Mac numerous times
08:20  Nexus74: well if you have a better idea, then go for it
08:20  profxavier: i dont
08:20  profxavier: thats why I am here
08:20  profxavier: what about Bonjour ?
08:20  Nexus74: your mac should pic it up on a reboot if you installed everything
08:20  Nexus74: I don't use Bonjour
08:20  profxavier: there are many different ways to configure a printer
08:21  profxavier: i dont want to config one, the restart
08:21  profxavier: doesn't work: then repeat
08:21  profxavier: i would prefer to do something sensible
08:21  Nexus74: just trying to help bub
08:21  profxavier: and I am just explaining, that your methodology is tedious
08:21  Nexus74: lol
08:22  Nexus74: restarteing two devices is tedius
08:22  Nexus74: ?
08:22  Nexus74: ok
08:22  profxavier: multiple times, yes
08:22  Nexus74: i didn't say do it multiple times
08:22  profxavier: not the 'restarting two devices'
08:22  Nexus74: I don't know if you've done that or not
08:22  profxavier: well, it will occur
08:22  profxavier: no way its working correctly the first time
08:24  Nexus74: where is everyone?
08:25  profxavier: hit the nail on the head with that one
08:27  Nexus74: Southron, good call on TextWrangler
08:27  Nexus74: looks like a keeper
08:28  Nexus74: Ok, gonna install Flash, lets see how big this baby is...
08:29  Nexus74: So far, with OS reinstall, I'm still under 5GB.  I love a clean slate

11:03  MrUnagi: can you help me figure out why when i do a backup the backupvolume is smaller than the source?
11:03  richardcavell: Do you have anything excluded by default?
11:04  richardcavell: I think it does exclude some directories by default, like the virtual memory file
11:04 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 79 seconds
11:05  MrUnagi: and that doesnt matter for booting up the volume right?
11:05  richardcavell: no
11:05  MrUnagi: cool =)
11:07  MrUnagi: i havent figured out how to automate the process and keep different directories
11:07  richardcavell: It's pretty damn reliable for me
11:07  richardcavell: I exclude one directory under /Users/richard
11:07  richardcavell: where I store movies
11:07  MrUnagi: i want those backed up :D
11:08  MrUnagi: lol
11:11  richardcavell: Well I already have them backed up, you see
11:11  richardcavell: If I put them on my proper backup, they take up space while not adding to my safety
11:19  MrUnagi: omg i hate these cheap charging cables
11:19  MrUnagi: anyway so you do full backups every time?
11:19  richardcavell: yeah
11:19  richardcavell: it's incremental
11:19  richardcavell: CCC does it in about 30 minutes max
11:20  richardcavell: My internal hard disk uses about 100 gigs
11:20  MrUnagi: i thought incremental only updates what has changed
11:20  richardcavell: yeah, that's what it is
11:20  richardcavell: CCC will do an incremental backup
11:20  richardcavell: You can do it the hard way if you like
11:20  richardcavell: But it's much slower
11:20  richardcavell: Time Machine also does it incrementally
11:20  richardcavell: I use both
11:20  MrUnagi: so, i could restart, and then boot off the external drive?
11:21 @crilly: I need to do a SuperDuper backup and a TM backup really.
11:21  richardcavell: MrUnagi: Yes you can
11:21  MrUnagi: that is pretty awesome
11:21  richardcavell: crilly: Can you boot from a USB OS X image? 
11:21  richardcavell: I can't remember
11:22  MrUnagi: i dont think you can from an image
11:23  richardcavell: I mean clone
11:23  richardcavell: I'm not sure if you can.  I think maybe you need to have OS X installed on the internal hard disk as well, since it looks at that first
11:23  richardcavell: can't remember
11:24  MrUnagi: i think you can restore it using another mac to the drive
11:24  MrUnagi: i dont see the point, just back up straight to the drive
11:27 @crilly: richardcavell, from a Super DUper clone? Yeah you can I think.
11:28  MrUnagi: i dunno why i shied away from super duper
11:28 @crilly: "SuperDuper is the wildly acclaimed program that makes recovery painless, because it makes creating a fully bootable backup painless." - http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html
11:28 @crilly: SuperDuper is brilliant. It's very user friendly.
11:28  richardcavell: Yeah I think you have to have OS X on the internal hard drive though
11:33  MrUnagi: i love tethering =)
11:36  MrUnagi: im riding down i95 while managing my server at home
11:39  doonie: anyone experienced with remote syslog? tutorials on the net say to edit the syslogd.plist, but the file is, well not a clean txt file?
11:40  MrUnagi: what would be the best protocol and/or lightweight built in system to use for a dropbox type service
11:40  MrUnagi: ftp comes to mind, but i dont know if that is as flexible as i would like it to be
11:42 @crilly: MrUnagi, use DropBox
11:42  MrUnagi: sigh....
11:42 @crilly: doonie, what's wrong with the file?
11:43  MrUnagi: figured someone was going to saay that
11:43 @crilly: MrUnagi, DB works flawlessly. It's beautiful :)
11:43  doonie: crilly:  looks wrangled.. will try textwrangler
11:44  MrUnagi: but it costs money
11:44 @crilly: No, you get 2GB for free, MrUnagi 
11:44 @crilly: Is 2GB not enough?
11:44  MrUnagi: no
11:44  AnthonyCat: Why not use ~/Public/Drop Box ?
11:45  MrUnagi: what do you mean lol
11:46  doonie: nice, textwrangler opened it normally =)
11:46 @crilly: doonie, :)
11:46  doonie: weird that all the tutorials point to nano 
11:46  doonie: when it opens it b0rked, like all other apps. guess tiger was different
11:49  doonie: is ther a smart app to let me have 2 docs on my 2 monitors, that show only the opened apps on the specific monitor..?
12:02 +Tomis: application menu>hide others, doonie 
12:02 +Tomis: the menubar only appears on one monitor, you can change which one
12:03  doonie: yea, would love it to be on both
12:03  doonie: darn remote syslog not working ;>`/
12:27  AnthonyCat: My usb isn't showing up on my macs boot list when I press alt. I only get refit, and windows 7. Any ideas of what might be causing this?
12:27  AnthonyCat: I've tried with chrome and ubuntu 10.10 on my usb
12:37 +Tomis: linux isn't a supported OS
12:37 +Tomis: only mac os x and windows
12:37  AnthonyCat: I've run linux before though.
