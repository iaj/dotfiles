00:14  PigFlu: How can i configure my macbook so that when i press cmd+8 i write a { symbol?
00:15  jeremyw: Why not just use shift+[
00:15  jeremyw: ?
00:16  PigFlu: i dont have an english keyboard
00:16  CPng|N: yeah that's a strange request
00:16  PigFlu: there is no [ key
00:16  jeremyw: They aren't expensive.  ;)
00:16  CPng|N: regardless, look in system prefs -> keyboard 
00:17  jeremyw: Okay...I'll do my best to help instead of making jokes.
00:17  PigFlu: im not going to buy an external english keyboard for my macbook just so i can write { easier.
00:17  PigFlu: besides, i'd lose 3 letters
00:17  PigFlu: thats just.. retarded.
00:17  jeremyw: I said it was a joke...no need to explain/whine/etc.
00:19  PigFlu: prefs -> keyboard gives nothing helpful
00:22  kithpom: PigFlu: maybe another application that allows you to modify your keys.
00:25  CPng|N: google "OS X key remap"
00:26  CPng|N: Keyboard Maestro is a good app
00:26  CPng|N: it could do that as well as a ton of other useful macro and keyboard shortcut type tings
00:27  CPng|N: I use it to "auto-type" a few different email responses in my support tickets
00:27 +Berzerker: PigFlu: look up "bettertouchtool"
00:27 +Berzerker: you can set keyboard shortcuts to do different things
00:27  CPng|N: or that
00:27  CPng|N: also good if you have a magic mouse
00:28 +Berzerker: or a trackpad
00:28  CPng|N: keyboard maestro lets you set up multi-bucket paste bins
00:29  CPng|N: move the mouse with the keyboard, remap keys, add macros, fake the scroll wheel with the keyboard
00:29  CPng|N: those 2 groups should team up for one super-duper-app

11:34  PascalHunger: i swear if apple keeps rasing the resolutions on these screens for its laptops its going to make us go blind 
11:34  PascalHunger: on a 13 inch screen anything more then a 1280 will be an eye sore

16:57  John___: hello, anyone know any good alarm clock apps for iphone?
16:57  John___: I bought alarm clock pro, but what the ****, all the alarm clock apps have to be opened for them to work?? I always wake up with half of the iphone's battery drained because of the alarm.
16:58  John___: I had no problem with downloading a free alarm clock app for my previous phone(which was android) and i did not have to have the app opened for it to work, and had PLENTY of customization

16:59  Marvolo: There's two things you need to know about the people of Cupertino
17:00  Marvolo: 1. Their ear holes are quite large, which is why iPod earbuds never fit in the rest of our ears.
17:00  Marvolo: 2. People never sleep. There is no need for a pleasant alarm.
17:01  John___: im posting a thread about this. There has to be something else.
17:01  Marvolo: and yah John___ thats the way it is set up
17:01  John___: WOW I just went to the apple website and they announced a new macbook air... liek anyone's getting any anyway...
17:01  Marvolo: I either use my macbook or my old ipod video for an alarm if i want music

17:05  John___: thats one price way too cheap
17:06  John___: I thought it was going to be $2,500
17:06  osxdude: lol
17:09  John___: cool, the software reinstall for the macbook air is a flash drive... instead the bundle of CD's you get with a regular macbook pro... which is what i got..
17:09  John___: I barely use my cd drive anyway... I actually like the new macbook air better now =O
17:09  Taco_Dude: Hi, I need some help getting my G3 working.
17:10  John___: I still got my G3 and still works.
17:11  Taco_Dude: I had Tiger on it, but then I failed at trying to put Debian on, and wanted to go back to Tiger. Unfortunately, I found that my Disk 2 and Disk 4 .isos were corrupt, so I couldn't install it. After downloading the disks again, I found that they were .dmgs (the G3 is the only macintosh I have), and I tried burning them with PowerISO on the lowest speed setting, but the boot menu (holding control) isn't giving me the ooption of booting from the newly-created 
17:11  Taco_Dude: CD
17:12  John___: g3 uses mac 9, .dmg's wont work obviously.
17:12  John___: oh wait
17:12  John___: you mean tiger
17:12  John___: nevermind, dont know, try again?
17:13  Taco_Dude: Lol, yeah, tiger.
17:14  Taco_Dude: Also: what on EARTH should I DO with the thing if/when i get it working?
17:19  John___: well then dont get it to work in the first place lol
17:20  John___: get a new mac. Thats all. I have my old G3 still with mac 9 because I liked playing Marathon on it still, hahahaha. but thats it.
17:20  Marvolo: I guess Apple is moving to 16x9?
17:22  Taco_Dude: I just want the imac for expiramentation
17:22  Taco_Dude: I don't actually want to PAY for a mac ;)
17:22  torchie: is they?
17:22  torchie: I want a mba 13" because it would wreck my current mac
17:22  torchie: but not $1100 wreck my current mac
17:24  Marvolo: The 13" Macbook Air is 16x10 but the 11" is 16x9. so are the new iMacs
17:25  Taco_Dude: I'm more of a PC guy, but I just wanted to tinker with a mac
17:26  John___: the new macbook air has 16:9 screens? eww..
17:26  John___: hell the new imacs are 16:9
17:26  Marvolo: I thought I misread when i first saw that
17:30  Taco_Dude: apple is screwed as long as Jobs is still in control
17:31  torchie: what
17:31  torchie: jobs is the best part
17:31  John___: bleh the new macbook air dont even offer 4GB of ram, I'm keeping my Macbook pro.
17:31  Taco_Dude: He's a jerk.
17:31  torchie: I know.
17:31  torchie: it's awe

17:31  Taco_Dude: wut

17:53  prestonc: Does anyone here use network Time Machine backups? I'm trying to find a way to not have to have my wife plugin our iTunes Mac (her MacBook), while still getting some backups. I tried an airport extreme with a USB hard drive and it tried to create a sparsebundle (so it started over) and it was really slow.
17:54  Marvolo: USB + Wifi will be slow on principle
17:54  prestonc: sure
17:54  prestonc: I thought it would be slow, just didn't realize how bad
17:54  prestonc: So is firewire better?
17:54  Marvolo: Firewire is much better
17:54  Marvolo: w/o wifi
17:55  prestonc: Is it liveable that way?
17:55  prestonc: ah
17:55  prestonc: :)
17:55  prestonc: I may be either stuck with Rsync or buying another Mac to handle the iTunes duties.
17:57  prestonc: I wish Mac had an RDC-like remote control software. That would make the Mac Mini as iTunes box more palatable. 
17:58  prestonc: If my wife could connect to it and control it with the same fidelity and screen resolution.
17:58  Marvolo: VNC is a solution
17:58  prestonc: Not for her, but yeah, otherwise.
17:58  prestonc: That's why I said I wished there was something more like RDC.
17:59  Marvolo: <_<
18:00  prestonc: what?
18:01  Marvolo: VNC is not a solution, then?
18:02  prestonc: No. The problem is that my wife has gotten used to having iTunes right at her fingertips. WIth VNC you have to scroll, etc.
18:04  prestonc: It isn't the same as being in front of the machine with the iTunes library. This has been a giant headache for me. If it were me I would just plug it in nightly and Time Machine would just pick up at night. But she finds it a hassle to "dock" it, when there isn't really a dock. 
18:04  Marvolo: You do nightly backups of your iTunes library?
18:05  prestonc: I'd like to do nightly at least every other night.
18:05  prestonc: or at least, rather
18:06  prestonc: Part of this comes from the fact that she buys a metric ton of TV on iTunes. I got back and watch some of it, or she has friends over to watch some of it, so we run out of hard drive space quickly.
18:09  prestonc: So back to the original solution, which feels like the only one that will work for us. If we had a Mac Mini (using that as Airport and Time Capsule don't support Firewire) with a Firewire drive attached would that be passable in terms of speed for overnight Time Machine backups?
18:10  prestonc: don't/doesn't
18:10  prestonc: typo day
18:10  Jenius_: Hi all 
18:11  ChrisAM: prestonc ... I missed the earlier part of the conversation... what are you trying to do?
18:11  prestonc: My wife downloads prodigious amounts of iTunes content.
18:11  prestonc: We share that iTunes library.
18:11  Jenius_: i am trying to install an application on my macbook pro, when i try copy the app to my application folder it says: "The operation can't be completed because you don't have permission to access some of the item" - I am the owner/admin, how come i get this msg? is there a way to resolve it? 
18:12  prestonc: I'd like to see that backed up regularly and semi-seamlessly. Otherwise she's not going to do it.
18:12  prestonc: And inevitably we're going to run out of space again and at that point she's going to delete content I may want still.
18:13  prestonc: So I tried doing USB + Airport Extreme network backups but that was really slow.
18:13  ChrisAM: I have a Linux file server here that houses my music... we SMB mount the share and have our iTunes library point to the mounted share.
18:14  prestonc: When you purchase new music, though, where does it go?
18:14  Branes: Jenius_: Have you attempted in the past to change the name of your account's home folder, or the account name?
18:15  prestonc: are you letting iTunes Library manage everything so that new TV show purchases (frequent in our house) go into the share in the proper location?
18:15  ChrisAM: to the share... you can change the iTunes folder location
18:15  prestonc: what kind of speed do you get downloading things using that?
18:15  prestonc: I run a Linux server, so I'
18:15  prestonc: I'm not opposed to that if it's servicable.
18:16 * Taco_Dude linux server brofists
18:16  ChrisAM: I use a gigabit wired LAN, so I don't notice latency with it.
18:16  prestonc: ah
18:16  prestonc: that's part of our issue. This is on a MacBook
18:16  prestonc: So something she takes to the couch to look for things to buy.
18:16  Jenius_: Branes: Yes, i have - i changed it like 6 weeks ago, did i do something wrong?
18:16  Branes: preston, iTunes can be easily configured to keep its library on any accesible volume -- if you have a linux server with umpty terabytes avilable, published over the network via SMB, that is a valid destination. The only thing you have to ensure is that the remote volume is mounted when the iTunes-aholic logs in.
18:17  ChrisAM: there's a little app called automountmaker that can help with that.
18:17  prestonc: transfer speed over network has to be brutal, though, right?
18:17  Branes: Jenius_: Quite probably, yes -- there is a specific method to be followed if you want to change a user account's name or the home folder. If you do not follow that procedure *exactly*, you lose administrative rights on most of the machine.
18:18  ChrisAM: prestonc ... playback for me over wifi isn't too bad... sometimes I move the macbook to plug it in to the stereo.
18:18  Jenius_: Branes: I guess i might have messed up then, is there a way to resolve this issue?
18:18  Branes: prestonc: USB2-grade speeds are more than sufficient, even for HD content.
18:19  prestonc: Playback isn't the issue for us. The issue for us is that my wife travels a lot for business. So a typical usage pattern would be sitting at the couch and downloading a movie rental and a season of TV. Then she plugs in her 32GB iPhone and fills it up with Video.
18:19  Branes: Jenius_: After six weeks of use? Not really, no -- you will need to save as much of your local data and non-Apple programs as possible, and reformat and re-install OSX from scratch.
18:20  ChrisAM: it should still be ok
18:20  ChrisAM: I wouldn't want to do an entire library transfer over wifi though.
18:20  prestonc: Sure
18:20  Jenius_: Branes: waaaa! i have to re-install my OSX! woaah... 
18:20  prestonc: as long as it wouldn't disconnect or something like that and cause the content to be lost or in limbo.
18:20  Jenius_: Branes:  i do not have the media disk with me for the OSX
18:21  ChrisAM: yeah
18:22  ChrisAM: where is the library stored now?
18:22  prestonc: RIght now it's on the MacBook
18:23  ChrisAM: if she travels and wants to keep the library with her, moving the library to the server might not be the best thing.
18:23  prestonc: Had a 250GB hard drive. I upgraded it to 500GB. But there's still a ton of content that's off the machine. Some of which I'd like to get back at but can't right now.
18:23  Branes: Jenius_: You can either try to borrow a set of grey installation media from someone who has the exact same model and revision of Mac as yourself, or ring the Apple phone support line and order a replacement set of machine discs to be sent to you (US$29 or equivalent), or you can visit an Apple store or reseller and buy the Snow Leopard Upgrade.
18:23  ChrisAM: you could use Automator action to kick off an rsync when she logs in at home.
18:23  Jenius_: i just bought this machine like 7 months ago :s
18:24  prestonc: Yeah, rsync is what I'm using for backups right now to be sure I have something every day.
18:24  prestonc: Plus it seems to be more efficient over the network than Time Machine.
18:24  Branes: Jenius_: The only safe way to undo the damage you have done will require the ability to boot from a second volume of some kind, restore the home folder and administrtor account to waht it was previously, then follow Apple's guide on changing account name ... and event hen, there is no real guarantee the repair will be successful, especially not after you have been using the machine with a broken keychain for six weeks.
18:25  ChrisAM: I wish time machine supported backups to any mounted share.
18:25  prestonc: ChrisAM, I do too.
18:25  Jenius_: Branes: i only changed the username? and i have to go thru all that for only changing a username?
18:25  Branes: Unfortunately yes.
18:25  prestonc: If it could just back up to SMB this would be a no-brainer.
18:26  Jenius_: Umm.. ok - then i got to do it
18:26  Branes: For some daft, as-yet-unexplained reason, Apple *still* have not stopped people from inadvertently changing the username or the name of the home folder, despite the catastrophic consequences.
18:27  Jenius_: i am currently running Mac OSX 10.6.4
18:27  Branes: Jenius_: For future reference: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1428?viewlocale=en_US
18:28  Jenius_: Branes: thank you so much, really appreciate your time
18:28  Branes: You're welcome. Its a far too common occurence, for my liking -- I have to un-do that silly mistake on client's machines once or twice a month.
18:29  prestonc: ChrisAM, So I'm kind of in this spot of giving up on Time Machine being a sure thing I can count on being used, having my wife purchase content via VNC onto the computer that is the iTunes computer or mounting a network drive.
18:29  ChrisAM: oh!--  defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1
18:29  ChrisAM: http://rajeev.name/2007/11/03/time-machine-with-smb-and-nfs-shares/
18:30  Branes: prestonc: The problem with that particular hack is that any Time Machine backup archive stands an insanely high chance of corruption.
18:30  prestonc: Branes, Sure
18:30  prestonc: That's why I've tried to keep it as close to Apple-approved as possible.
18:31  Jenius_: Branes: totally new to mac.. made a shift like 7 months ago.. still learning :-)
18:31  Branes: Two alternative approaches: 1) using a large .dmg virtual volume kept on a non-compliant server, mounting it, and TMing to that, 2) paying the shareware fee for SuperDuper! and using its advanced rsync backup system (which I think is better than Time Machine, just without the silly interface)
18:32  prestonc: I have no problem paying for something if it's reliable
18:33  AxonetBE: hello
18:33  ChrisAM: prestonc ... have you looked at ARD instead of VNC? I could never justify the expense myself, but it might be useful for you.
18:33  Branes: The only drama you may encounter with using a non-HFS destination for backups is that you *may* lose metadata. OSX and may Apple apps make heavy use of 'proprietry' metadata.
18:34  prestonc: Have never heard of ARD
18:34  Branes: Apple Remote Desktop.
18:34  Branes: It's a superset of VNC.
18:34  Branes: Personally, I'd buy a licence for logmein.com than pay for ARD.
18:34  AxonetBE: why I need xcode for installing macports?
18:34  prestonc: How's it different, then?
18:35  ChrisAM: It's $300 different than VNC. :P
18:35  Branes: AxonetBE: XCode contains all the necessary programs and libraries for building.
18:35  prestonc: The reason the VNC option is sub-optimal is because it means looking at a smaller viewport and/or scrolling the computer you're viewing
18:35  AxonetBE: yes but it is stupid to download something from 2gb
18:35  AxonetBE: to install something of 8mb
18:36  Branes: prestonc: ARD gains its speed (compared to traditional VNC) by passing compressed Quartz screen object definitions, instead of pixel-streams.
18:36  ChrisAM: it's more Windows-RDP like.
18:36  prestonc: Can it do full screen?
18:36  Branes: AxonetBE: You don't have a choice, unfortunately -- XCode adds all the "missing bits" you would find in a standard linux distro, and then some.
18:36  Branes: prestonc: yes, in fact it works best in full screen.
18:37  AxonetBE: Branes: but it will slow down the system or not?
18:37  Branes: AxonetBE: Not at all.
18:37  AxonetBE: Branes: yeah I was thinking, something of 2gb :)
18:38  ChrisAM: Installing XCode will add the extra needed files... You won't notice any slowness unless you run the actual XCode IDE (which you don't need to)
18:38  Branes: Most of that 2 GB of XCode is libraries.
18:38  Branes: OSX won't touch any of the XCode material normally.
18:38  ChrisAM: but xcode will add gcc, make, all the libs, etc.
18:38  Branes: AxonetBE: You may be able to find a pre-compiled binary of the program you are wishing to install.
18:39  AxonetBE: I wish to install imagemagick
18:39  AxonetBE: because I need it for developping in rails
18:39  ChrisAM: AxonetBE ... do you have your OS X DVD?
18:39  AxonetBE: ChrisAM: yes I have
18:39  prestonc: Yeah, that's pricey
18:40  ChrisAM: XCode is on the DVD iirc... it's been a while
18:40  ChrisAM: it would save you a big download
18:40  AxonetBE: ChrisAM: thx:)
18:40  Branes: Depending on the version you have, you may still need to do a big download. XCode can be found in the folder "Optional Installs"
18:41  Branes: It's usually on disc 1 of the grey-labeled discs.
18:42  AxonetBE: ok another question, in the past I was always a windows user, but now I switched to mac osx. But is there a shortcut to show desktop?
18:42 --- Blink7_ is now known as Blink7
18:43  Marvolo:  it depends on your settings. Go to >System preferences>Keyboard and Mouse> Keyboard shortcuts
18:44  Marvolo: there should be one in that list such as F9 or F11, etc
18:44  Marvolo: you can also cahnge it
18:45  Marvolo: If you're looking for a Mouse shortcut, go to the DashBoard & Exposé preferences
18:45  prestonc: Alright. Thanks everyone that helped. I'll kick those ideas around.
18:46  Branes: AxonetBE: You're after an Exposé function. The default is F11 to show just the desktop.
18:46  AxonetBE: Branes: thx
18:46  AxonetBE: Marvolo: thx also :)
18:50  ChrisAM: AxonetBE ... I set up a hot corner for that.
18:52 --- Marvolo is now known as Tsavo
18:53  AxonetBE: another question: I have the new MBP, but when the battery is full charged, I let him connected to the power adapter, is it bad?
18:53  crilly: zer0her0: here mate?
18:54  Tsavo: osxdude did you ever reveal what iLife program that screeny was from?
18:54  ChrisAM: AxonetBE ... here is apple's recommendation for maintaining a good battery: http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/9036.html
18:55  Branes: AxonetBE: What kills batteries is heat, and all Apple laptops run off the battery exclusively, even when connected to the mains via MagSafe. The greatest source of heat is the charging cycle. For maximum battery life, it is strongly advised that you "condition" the battery once a month - charge to full, then run til flat, then charge without using the machine overnight.
18:56  fleebailey33: Branes: apple needs to make better batteries
18:57  crilly: fleebailey33: The battieres in the new MBA are pretty impressive.
18:57  Branes: fleebailey33: Apple (and everyone else) need to stop using a charge-discharge ratio higher than 1:3
18:57  fleebailey33: crilly: i disagree
18:57  fleebailey33: battery tech has come so little 
18:58  crilly: Skype won't login. Hmm (first time using it on a Mac).
18:58  fleebailey33: whats come far is how software adapts to batteries
18:58  crilly: fleebailey33: In general yeah  guess battery technology hasn't really made big leaps.
18:58  AxonetBE: but people say it is no problem to let them connect 
18:58  AxonetBE: of you are using it
19:00  crilly: OK, does anyone use Skype on OSX here? Mine is just constantly signing in, over and over.
19:00  ChrisAM: I think I only get a few minutes of battery life now
19:00  crilly: Ah eventually it timed out with a network settings issue.
19:00  crilly: ChrisAM: On what?
19:02  ChrisAM: my macbook
19:02  ChrisAM: I'm gonna see now... I just unplugged it
19:02  ChrisAM: says 20 minutes remaining
19:02  Tsavo: How many cycles have you gone through?
19:02  crilly: how old is it?
19:03  ChrisAM: ~5 years
19:03  AxonetBE: and what about let him in sleep mode during the night?
19:03  ChrisAM: 232 cycles
19:03  AxonetBE: or is it beter to shut him down?
19:04  ChrisAM: my macbook has been plugged in and running 24/7 for most of those 5 years.
19:04  Tsavo: is there a way to gather all widgets into one screen?
19:04  Tsavo: i can't see how many cycles my battery has has because the iStat widget was on my external moniter which i can't access right now
19:05  ChrisAM: system profile will show you
19:05 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
19:05  Tsavo: 878 cycles
19:06  Tsavo: but i didn't run it like a server like you
19:06  Tsavo: until very recently
19:07  ChrisAM: I'm really surprised that my macbook is still on
19:08  ChrisAM: the battery would normally have run out by now
19:08  Tsavo: do you think you should get a new battery, or is it not critical that you have it?
19:08 --- jedivulcan_ is now known as jedivulcan
19:08  ChrisAM: yeah.. the condition is listed as "Replace Now"
19:09  ChrisAM: But it's about time to get a new laptop anyway.
19:10  Tsavo: problems or is it just old?
19:10  ChrisAM: age I think
19:10  Tsavo: my battery is saying ~3 and a half hours
19:10  ChrisAM: I've never taken care of the battery on it.
19:11  Tsavo: I'm talking about in general of your laptop. Is the laptop having problems or is just time for something new?
19:11  crilly: ChrisAM: What new toy have you got in mind then? Oooooh how exciting! A new Mac :D
19:11  ChrisAM: oh... no problems with it
19:11  ChrisAM: I'll probably go with a 13 or 15" MBP
19:12  crilly: ChrisAM: Ah! I have a 2009 MBP 13". Lovely little machines. I want to up my RAM to 4GB DDR3 and replace the small 180GB HDD with a 500GB one.
19:13  ChrisAM: still says 20 minutes remaining on the battery
19:13  Tsavo: funny how that happens
19:13  crilly: I can't get Skype to connect. hmm
19:14  ChrisAM: It took a really long time for a fresh install of skype to connect for me the other day.
19:15  LSD`: Skype is connected and online here it would seem...
19:15  crilly: ChrisAM: wow yeah it's orked now. what's that about? does it always take that long?
19:16  ChrisAM: it only did that the first time for me... now it connects fine.
19:16  crilly: DId you do any port forwarding at all?
19:16  ChrisAM: no
19:17  crilly: OK. I'm going to disable the port forwarding I have enabled to see how it reacts.
19:17  crilly: ChrisAM: Do you know if Skype can be configured to work with an existing mobile phone number? i.e., can I send SMS from my existing mobile number via Skype?
19:17  ChrisAM: dunno
19:18  ChrisAM: you can send sms with Google Voice
19:19  crankharder: anyone have an airport express just for streaming music to a stero?
19:19  crankharder: how exactly does that work? whats the interface like?
19:19  crilly: I actually would like to remove all Call/SMS related features from Skype and use the IM abilities really. I only want to switch from MSN/gmail to Skype because I use Skype in work to talk to our other sites. My as well just switch to it entirely.
19:19  ChrisAM: crankharder ... I do.
19:19  ChrisAM: in the bottom corner of itunes, you just tell it to send the music to your airport express.
19:20  crankharder: from any itunes?
19:20  crilly: From any iTunes on a device with WiFi access.
19:20 --- MeMeNoDe is now known as memenode
19:20  ChrisAM: the airport express needs to be joined to your wireless network
19:21  crankharder: cool, thanx :)
19:22  ChrisAM: If you want to send non-itunes audio to it, you'll need something like this: http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/mac/
19:26  ChrisAM: welp, my battery lasted 24 minutes.
19:26  crilly: ChrisAM: eeek
19:26  crilly: yeah I think you need a new laptop mate :P
19:31  panosru: hello
19:32  crilly: Hi
19:32  panosru: is anyone here involved with app development on OSX ?
19:33  crilly: panosru: Not I. #macdev
19:33  crilly: panosru: Not I. #macosxdev
19:33  panosru: ah cool ! thanks! :D
19:38  crilly: ChrisAM: What does the "Skype Me!" feature in Skype do?
19:39  ChrisAM: lets people know that you want to talk to strangers
19:40  ChrisAM: "SkypeMe! mode temporarily disables your privacy settings and allows anyone to contact you, whether you've OK'd them or not."
19:40  crilly: ah so that explains why that random person IMed me
20:08  crilly: I wish PixelMator had a path tool. It would be the perfect counnterpart to Photoshop then.
20:16  diffract|: is there a simple image editor for mac that starts within 2 seconds? i don't like running photoshop or fireworks just to very simple things
20:16  crilly: diffract|: Pixelmator is pretty fast.
20:17  diffract|: i'll check it out
20:21  atmosx: I use acorn
20:21  atmosx: is like a cropped version of photoshop
20:21  atmosx: pixelmater might be better, costs a bit more though (I think)
20:22  crilly: I got Pixelmator for $20.
20:22  crilly: Thanks to Branes spotting some ad. with a voucher code.
20:22  atmosx: hmmm
20:22  atmosx: aaah okay
20:22  crilly: But even without that, it's $50/60.
20:24  atmosx: well Acorn must be 45 or something
20:47  diffract|: do you guys actually buy software?
20:48  diffract|: you lost me at comparing prices
20:49  crilly: I do, aye.
20:49  crilly: I like to suppor developers for their work. It only leads to them writing more softare and updates for their existing work too.
20:51  SpyderZ: Hey guys
20:51  SpyderZ: Can anyone recommend a good newsgroup reader for Mac?
20:52  ChrisAM: SpyderZ ... Unison
20:52  SpyderZ: ChrisAM: Thanks

21:42  John___: people really love their iphones....
21:42  ErrantEgo: are there any need for speed free downloads for os x?
21:42  ErrantEgo: or is that something i gotta pay for?
21:44  AxonetBE: how to type ~  ?
21:44  AxonetBE: on mac?
21:44  ErrantEgo: the key next to the 1 key
21:44  ErrantEgo: hit shift
21:44  ErrantEgo: then hit that key
21:44  John___: shift+ key left of 1
21:44  Branes: Depends on your keyboard layout. Default is shift ` (top left, next to or below Esc)
21:45  ErrantEgo: Branes: are ther any free downloads for that game?
21:45  ErrantEgo: (i wanna be sure i dont get kicked in the ass :P)
21:45 * Branes has no idea what you're talking about
21:45  ErrantEgo: NFS hot pursuit

21:49  ErrantEgo: yeah ok
21:49  John___: dont ask for a free download of a game that you have to pay for. Silly.
21:49  ErrantEgo: tahts what o thought
21:49  ErrantEgo: hey
21:49  Branes: Valve titles are proper ports. Electronic Arts titles use the Transgaming Cider wrapper, which is pathetic.

21:55  Branes: Sure; the science of it is called neurolinguistic programming.
21:55  ErrantEgo: i wonder what that computer would be worth
21:55  ErrantEgo: as a collectors item
21:55  ErrantEgo: being a vintage machine
21:56  Branes: Whilst not foolproof, it does increases the efficacy of the message(s) you are trying to impart.
21:56  Branes: ErrantEgo: as much as I like old Macs, a bubble iMac without FireWire is street trash. Not even worth gutting and turning into a cat littler-tray.

21:57  ErrantEgo: hehe

21:57  matthias-: my mac got SO SLOW. somehow

21:57  matthias-: ;]
21:58  remyo: matthias-: Telling, http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/
21:58  Branes: Its a name of a program, Matt.
21:58  Branes: It will tell you what is taking up space, but won't tell you what is safe to delete.
21:58  remyo: Nooo. I wanna know your "grand perspective". About everything! 
21:58  matthias-: Branes: I gathered; im looking for something to show me that /Applications is 15G and /Applications/iGetter is 5MB

22:04  Branes: If you still have problems, you should clone your hard drive to an external drive, reformat the internal, re-install OSX, and use the Transfer My Files (migration assitant) part of setup to import your settings from the clone.
22:05  Branes: The 10.6 DVD will be sufficient. But you *must* run Disk Utility form it first, to ensure your hard drive directory structure is intact and error-free.

22:05  matthias-: Branes: So I need to do it before applejack ?
22:06  js_: any idea what could prevent me from creating aggregate sound devices?
22:06  js_: the application just flickers when i press the + sign
22:06  Branes: What are you talking bout, js?
22:07  Branes: Yes Matt, boot from the DVD first and runn Disk Utility.
22:07  matthias-: Branes: Could i ask why? As it would be just easier to use applejack first, and it seems its got same usability
22:07  js_: Branes: combining two sound devices into one in the "sound/midi settings" application
22:08  Branes: No, because you need to boot from another volume first to ensure that the volume you wish to test and repair is in fact without error.
22:08  js_: i've done it on other machines without problems, but it won't work on mine, i suppose it's something somewhere preventing it
22:08  Branes: js_: Not possible.
22:08  js_: Branes: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3956
22:09  Branes: If you install soemthing like jackosx, you should be able to do it. The Realtek chips Apple use these days are frankly disgusting.
22:10  Branes: If Apple say you can do it, ask or search on the discussion forums
22:11  js_: righto
22:12  CEnTR4L: Branes, could you please explain why would you want Intel-free Macs?
22:13  diffract|: my colloquy notifications don't disappear until i click them, is there a way to make them disappear after a few seconds?
22:15  Branes: The ability to run Windows is a bug, not a feature. I flatly refuse to own an Intel-powered device of any kind.
22:18  CEnTR4L: I hear you but the ability to combine two worlds in once solid and quality machine is an advantage, I don't have to work in two notebooks in my life, one personal and the other for work.
22:19  CEnTR4L: Corporations, most of them anyways are dependent on Microsoft unfortunately. I don't like it but this is the way it is.
22:20  Branes: That's where you and I differ - I refuse conformity if it goes against my ethics, even if such a choice could be detrimental.
22:22  CEnTR4L: So you're saying that you would refuse a good job just because they in that job use a far from perfect OS with stupid MS software...
22:22  Branes: Absolutely.
22:25  CEnTR4L: This is why I was asking about "neurolinguistic programming", so I it would help me to express myself (something I'm bad at) and deliver my thoughts, ideas and thinking to the people who I work for...
22:29  Branes: That requires not only an exceptionally good grasp of your written and spoken language, but also a strong understanding of emotions and the emotional bonds every word has. NLP is choosing the right word with the desired emotional response at the right time.
22:30  CEnTR4L: Any books you'd personally recommend for a beginner?
22:30  CEnTR4L: - in that subject -
22:31  Branes: Nothing that immediately comes to mind, although there are several I've encountered over the years. None of them taught me anything I was not already aware of, which suprised me :)
22:32  Branes: I've always had a way with words, though ... natural talent, or just started at an early age. *shrug*
22:33  Branes: Getting to know and understand your own emotions is absolutely key, however.
22:33  Branes: (not an easy job for most western-society males)
22:43  Brian2898: what does "^ arrow keys mean"
22:43  Brian2898: what is "^"

22:50  anr78: I'm looking for an OS X driver to read (and maybe write) ext4. Anyone seen something like that?
22:51  diffract|: yes, in google
22:53  matthias-: ok, I can't do the disc utility
22:53  matthias-: cause my SuperDrive aint working :>

23:55  vxla: crilly: but that's only one-way, if you want to sync in the other direction that is a bit more difficult
23:57  crilly: one-way would be fine. MBP -> Other Mac
23:57  ChrisAM: do the two macs need independent libraries?
23:58  crilly: Well actually, I might want the other Mac having on selected music from MBP
23:58  crilly: in fact problem solved
23:59  fleebailey33: media rover or something
23:59  fleebailey33: although havn't tried
23:59  crilly: I'll want the second Mac to have what's on the iPhone, so after syncing to the MBP, I can then sync to the MBA.
23:59  vxla: if there's anything you want on the remote just do it backwards, but read up on rsync to see the options for file deletion.
