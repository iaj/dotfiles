00:08  Velociraptors: 'ello and happy day!
00:09  LordDragon: Velociraptors, happy weekend to you too

00:56 --- Brisk` is now known as Brisk
01:04  rryouumaa: just noticed "::1             localhost " in /etc/hosts.  is this some bootup thing?
01:10  mininessie: if i sent my macbook pro into apple to fix my cd drive which is broken and needs to reinstall an os on it cause linux failed and can booting the laptop would they ever look to see if i had anything illegal on there 
01:14  mininessie: anyone here
01:15  mrapple: maybe
01:15  mininessie: mrapple: maybe what? 
01:15  mrapple: anyone here
01:16 @bashusr: no
01:16  mininessie: no what
01:17  mrapple: *headdesk*
01:17 --- bashusr has changed the topic to: Welcome to ##mac! | Channel rules: Play nice, no hackintosh & English only | Register @ http://ircmac.com/ | DIY @ http://iFixIt.com
01:18  mininessie: if i sent my macbook pro into apple to fix my cd drive which is broken and needs to reinstall an os on it cause linux failed and can booting the laptop would they ever look to see if i had anything illegal on there 
01:22  mrapple: yep. and if they find illegal stuff, they won't return your laptop and they'll sure.
01:23  mrapple: sue*
01:25  mininessie: mrapple: are you serious
01:26  mrapple: http://tinyurl.com/6xccrm
01:26  KeeperOfTheSoul: excellent, hdd arrived, now how much space for OSX and how much for time machine
01:27  KeeperOfTheSoul: drive is 750gb
01:28  terr_:  I'm looking for a hackintosh channel... or if someone here can help me.  I have no Mac exerience nad would like to dabble a bit... just to learn how it works.  Also I want to probably write some shell scripts.  I can lay my hands on a mac pro for about $600 but it will only gather dust.  OTOH if I actully do need on I'll get one.  In the mena time I want to set up a test machine probably on a little ASUS netbook with an N270 using say virt
01:28  terr_: box
01:28  terr_:  or VMware.  Suggestions?
01:28  terr_: [15:40:13] <terr_> BTW - thge test machine will need to run a few var
01:28  mrapple: the point of time machine is so when one drive dies there's a backup KeeperOfTheSoul 
01:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: did you read the topic?
01:28  terr_: I used English
01:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: naw, I'm using time machine to protect against deleting stuff
01:28  mrapple: terr_: the topic states no hackintosh
01:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: for backup against failure I'm mirroring the drive to an external unit
01:29 +Branes: No hackintosh. You won't find any help regarding hackintosh on the freenode network.
01:29  terr_: mrapple: why?  I'm not trying to do anything illegal.
01:29 * mrapple re-formats KeeperOfTheSoul's drive
01:29  mrapple: terr_: doesn't matter. that's the rules.
01:29  terr_: mrapple: who made the rules?
01:29  mrapple: terr_: not me. i just follow them.
01:29  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: Apple, its against their T&Cs
01:30  terr_: mrapple: I want to get a virtual machine running in a mac as well so I can show our team some other options.
01:30 +Branes: terr_: Practice your google-fu and find a different network.
01:30  terr_: what is a T&C
01:30  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: see, OSX Server, that allows and supports OSX virtual machines IIRC
01:30  terr_: Apple will sell me an OSX server license
01:31  mrapple: terr_: T&C are terms and conditions
01:31 +Branes: Keeps is referring to the Apple Software Licence Agreement, which is a legally binding document in the US and in countries which are members of the Free Trade Agreement.
01:31  terr_: Problem is it typically runs on a desktop type machine and I can't even lift one.  Too big.  I need something small and slow
01:31 +Branes: The SLA stipulates you can only run Mac OS X on Apple designed and manufactured hardware.
01:31  KeeperOfTheSoul: so thinking say, 500gb for osx and 250gb time machine? or is 250 over the top?
01:32  mrapple: Branes: don't technically if you own the software, you can put it on whatever the hell you want?
01:32  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: you don't own the software, that's the key point, you license it
01:32 +Branes: terr_: Check eBay or Craigslist for an older MacBook. Should be able to pick one up for a few hundred.
01:32  terr_: Branes: fine.. then I will only run the FreeBSD part it it.  They can't stop me from doing that!
01:32  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: that's fine, open darwin I belive it is
01:32  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: I bought the CD. I now own this license of mac os x. i can modify it however i want, as long as i dont redistribute it
01:32  KeeperOfTheSoul: though not sure if that project went anywhere
01:33  terr_: Branes I can get them for free.  I can get a mac pro for about $600.  THis is not the issue.  I need a testbed which I can wreak and reboot.
01:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: no you can't you can only modify the fbsd parts, but can't modify or install the apple parts on anything but apple hardware
01:34  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: so ill get arrested for sticking a cd in my pc? sounds legit.
01:34  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: I'm looking to write some chron scripts and do some Rsync for our team... We need things like a dropbox and this is a decent thing to try.
01:34  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: sure, but you don't need osx to play around with that?
01:34  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: I have lots of operating systems to use but I want to test the code before I foist it on the team.
01:34 +Branes: terr_: See if the company you work for will fork out for a Mini Server. They're cheap, they come with OSX Server, and you can virtualise OSX on it with VMware Fusion.
01:35  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: I need to know how apple organised the system and what is there and what is not.  I just need a test bed.
01:36  terr_: Branes: I run my own company.  Terralogic.  I have offers for hardware but seriously I can't lift it.  I tore ouyt my shoulder on Nov 18 and had an AC repair Nov 25 and I can't lift more than a coffee cup.  A little netbook will tide me through.
01:37  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: macbook air?
01:37 +Branes: Doesn't run Server, so you can't virtualise OSX on OSX.
01:37  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: maybe.  I just need something I can play with for a couple weeks.
01:37 --- fujisan is now known as fujisano
01:38 --- fujisano is now known as fujiosano
01:38 +Branes: terr_: talk to a store rep about finance on a Mini Server, or talk to your accountant about offsetting the costs of a lease against tax.
01:38  terr_: Branes: down the track I'll want windows on OSX because most of the team uses OSX on MacBook pros.
01:38 +Branes: a Mini Server is a Mac Mini with no optical drive, dual hard drives, and OSX Server.
01:39  terr_: Branes: Mini server sounds like a good idea - but I'd like to have a few days of play time under my belt.
01:39 +Branes: Well, there are ways to do that ... but we're not allowed to discuss them here :)
01:39 +Branes: Stretch your google-fu muscles, young padawan.
01:40  LordDragon: blah
01:40  LordDragon: screw google
01:40  LordDragon: i use yahoo.com
01:40  fujiosano: YAHOO!
01:40  KeeperOfTheSoul: so, 250GB too much for time machine or would that be reasonable?
01:40  terr_: Branes: I can just borrow a mac book pro and Ryan has a mini for sale for $600 and its like 6 months old.  I just don't want to screw up their machines.
01:41  LordDragon: KeeperOfTheSoul, that depends on how much info you need to backup
01:41  terr_: branes I cna also log in via the net.
01:41  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: plan to backup to a separate drive via cloning, so this is really to save against accidental deletion
01:41  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: so ill get arrested for sticking a cd in my pc? sounds legit.
01:42  terr_: Branes: I just want something real simple and when I used VMWare back in 1998 I installed NT and ORACLE and it ran just fine for me on a 233 mHx Pentium I I think!
01:42  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: of course not
01:42 +Branes: terr_: buy yourself a small FireWire-based external hard drive. You can install your own copy of OSX onto that and boot from it on any FireWire-equipped Mac (the Mini and the MacBook Pro both qualify), mess around to your heart's delight, and it won't affect their machine or their OS install.
01:42  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: then what about it is ilegal
01:42  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: about what?
01:42  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: hackintosh
01:43  fujiosano: btw does anybody know if i can run ppc games with an Intel Mac using rosetta?
01:43  terr_: Branes: I hae a firewire HDD here.  Probably about 200GB.  I never knew what to use it for!
01:43 +Branes: terr_: When you're done experimenting, the drive is still useful on other machines, or can be used as storage or a Time Machine drive when you buy your own Mac.
01:43  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: because the EULA says you can't install it on non-Apple hardware or alter the Apple propriatry code
01:43  terr_: Branes: I also have mor SCSI stuff than most people can count!
01:43  fujiosano: so is it allowed to run older versions os x in VMs?
01:44 +Branes: I've still got some SCSI gear around for when I'm working on my older beasties :)
01:44  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: so someone could have a EULA that says "You can only install this software on the 2010 macbook pro. otherwise, you are doing something illegal"
01:44  terr_: Branes: I use Linux on my desktop and OpenBSD on the servers and this solves my problems.  However I'm working with a team of architects and they like the Mac world so I figure I should learn something about their world.
01:45  fujiosano: terr_: 
01:45  fujiosano: best architecture agencies use windows
01:45  KeeperOfTheSoul: mrapple: indeed they could if software were produced with that EULA, and those would be the rules to using that software
01:45  LordDragon: KeeperOfTheSoul, well if its just stuff like your OS and some music and videos and documents. 250gb should be fine. but if you have a huge video library etc, you might need more. for most ppl 250gb is adaquate
01:45  fujiosano: it's the truth
01:45  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: ah, didn't think about that, time machine will want to copy everything rather than only changes won't it
01:45  mrapple: KeeperOfTheSoul: then I quit life
01:46  terr_: fujiosano: I'm not qualified to comment.  
01:46  KeeperOfTheSoul: hmm, perhaps I need re-think my partitioning then, damn
01:46  fujiosano: So installing os x in a virtual machine is allowed then?
01:46  terr_: fujiosano: I just want some hands on pleasure with a mac.   I think I'm ready for something "tactile"
01:46  LordDragon: KeeperOfTheSoul, yes and no. by default it backs up all your drives and files, and then each new backup only copies the files that have changed since the last backup. however if there are large files or folders you DONT want timemachine to touch, then u can tell time machine to exlucde that folder
01:47  fujiosano: oh ok terr_ 
01:47  terr_: LordDragon: sounds like RSync
01:47  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: its more, I want time-machine to protect againts accidental deletion, and a separate external drive that I clone the main drive to for protection against hardware failure
01:47  LordDragon: terr_, ive never heard of this RSync. sounds kind of weird. time machine is built in to leopard/snow leopard and is easy to use
01:48  terr_: fujiosano: Apple should offer a log in to a virtual machine for ppl like me!
01:48  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: yeah, Apple have always been a bit anti-VM
01:48  LordDragon: KeeperOfTheSoul, well time machine backs up like once an hour or something. so if you keep your time machine connected, you should be able to recover deleted files 
01:48  terr_: LordDragon: what planet were you born on and when?  And I'm not being nasty or sarcastic.  I might be in the time machine!
01:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: except the external drive will only be connected about once a week
01:49  LordDragon: KeeperOfTheSoul, ah then thats a problem
01:49  terr_: LordDragon: try this.  Find a command prompt and >  man rsync
01:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: hence why I wanted to use an internal partition to copy the changes to, and external to mirror
01:50  KeeperOfTheSoul: LordDragon: but time-machine making a full copy to the other partition would be a pain and kind of defeat the purpose
01:50  KeeperOfTheSoul: which has always made me question the value of time-machine on a laptop
01:50  LordDragon: terr_, sorry, all i heard was something like 'blah blah Find a command prompt and blah blah' the flaw in what you said began with "Find a command prompt and"
01:50  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: see - the time machine I see you guys chatting about can be a dropbox for a small project team.  I was looking to rsync because I never heard of timemachine.
01:51  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: not really, time-machine is aimed at backing up a single machine
01:51  jkeyes0isawesome: Linux rules!
01:51 +Branes: Time Machine is Apple's automated backup system, it's basically rsync wrapped up in a whole mess o' bad code and a really ghastly interface.
01:51  terr_: LordDragon: In my server world I live by scripts and the caommnd prompt shells... not GUI.  I do not find GUI intuitive
01:52 +Branes: And you want to learn an OS where the commandline is a  third-rate citizen, a tacked-on afterthought?
01:52 +Branes: My my my :)
01:52  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah, might just not bother with time machine, I'll stick to just cloning my drive
01:52  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: so we take 6 machines and like shuffle the card deck to create a superset of the files and then have each client resuync to the master
01:53  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: to achive what?
01:53  Velociraptors: resurrection of the dead. 
01:53  terr_: Branes: now you know why I want a VM.  How should I know that?  I've never touched a Mac.  But I sure hear good thing!
01:54  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: but if you havn't used a mac, and are happy with say fbsd, why not stick to fbsd which has no problems in a vm?
01:54  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: 6 people. 6 machines.  One directory.  Sync to a server.  Sync back.  Drobox done.  Rsync will do this.
01:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: until 2 people change the same file :)
01:55 --- jkeyes0isawesome is now known as jordanisawesome
01:55  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: hence my question of what it is trying to achive
01:55  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: because other people do not live in my world.  They like their macs... and from what I can tell for very good reason.
01:56 +Branes: Yeah, because they stay out of your face as they're intuitive. They follow Kay's First Law: Teach computers how humans work.
01:57 +Branes: Apple make user interfaces. Microsoft make in-your-faces, the *nix camp are still arguing about the best way to chip flint.
01:57  KeeperOfTheSoul: though MS have started improving
01:58  LordDragon: terr_, if you dont have a mac or like macs why are you here?
01:59  KeeperOfTheSoul: only problem with OSX is you do have to play by Apple's rules, and those rules are quite strict on somethings
01:59  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: ya.  I know.  We are not doing CVS type stuff.  If Angie hits Karen's work then Karen will call Angie.  They just want a common up to date set of files.
02:00  LordDragon: theres no "apple's rules". apple has a specific intuitive way of doing things. if you fight against the easy way of doing things and you prefer the complicated way,then macs prob arent best for you. apple has done lots of research and knows the best way to accomplish tasks on a computer for most ppl out there
02:00  KeeperOfTheSoul: I do wish OSX wouldn't get so angry about not ejecting a usb drive
02:01  terr_: LordDragon: I thought I came here in search of a Hackintosh.  I want to find out what OSx is at the programmer/sys admin level and I would like to do a bit of playing in a virtual machine and as I write this I realise Apple should offer a virtual machine for prospect~ive customers.
02:02  LordDragon: terr_, hackintosh is insecure buggy and illegal. and talk of hacktinosh is not permitted in here
02:02  Velociraptors: LordDragon: you're about 30 minutes behind the convo :)
02:02  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: in fairnes, from what I've heard hackintosh wouldn't be a very good experience of what OSX has to offer
02:02  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: Can we hook a USB to an iPod somehow?  Maybe via Bluetooth?
02:02  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: part of the Apple philosiphy is simplicity, which by all accounts hackintosh is anything but
02:03  LordDragon: Velociraptors, ooops i am distracted. all i saw was this terr_ guy going on about how he hates macs etc :P
02:03  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: so you'd kind of be missing the key point of using a mac
02:03  LordDragon: terr_, bottom line. this channel isnt for you. go build your hackintosh somewhere else
02:03  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: If someone could rent/lend me a machine which ran off a USB stick so I can't screw it up then a weekend would be fine.
02:04  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: you know, its fairly simple to clone OSX using something like Superduper!
02:04  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: Obviously I don't know!  I thought things like Grub adn lifting master boot records were obvious.
02:05  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: and OSX can install to an external drive, and boot from it (obviously, on a Mac, assuming you'd be borrowing a macbook or the like here)
02:05  alexlea: hey LordDragon
02:05  LordDragon: hey alexlea. hows your weekend going?
02:05  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: that works!
02:06  KeeperOfTheSoul: terr_: I'd still clone first, since the main drive is accessible as a mounted volume when doing that :)
02:06  terr_: Will I be able to hire someone in Calagry to slog through the trenches?
02:06  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: If I'm going to borrow a machine or rent one I want to return it in unused condition.
02:07  alexlea: LordDragon: heh, i didnt even realise its the weeken
02:07  terr_: KeeperOfTheSoul: in order to write some of the scripts I have to have root access.  
02:07  LordDragon: alexlea, yep. saturday night! party time! :P
02:09  jordanisawesome: macs are overpriced and linux is free!
02:09  alexlea: LordDragon: are you partying? lol
02:09  KeeperOfTheSoul: ah bugger, looks like I rounded a few of the screws last time I opened this :(
02:10  LordDragon: alexlea, yep. im getting wasted on crystal light and partying with peeps on IRC while watching stargate! a night all college kids would be envious of! :P
02:10  Swian: wow looks like I missed a good debae
02:10  terr_: LordDragon: LOL.  Ya - Party time.  Tanya wants me to come over for her Xmas party and I had shoulder surgery Nov 25 and am lucky to be able to sit at my desk and even talk to a Mac Group... and my party will be with my narcotics!  Not only this the Federal Crown Prosector in the drug section is a friend of mine.  So much for Tanya's party.  I hurt too much
02:10  Swian: debate
02:11  alexlea: LordDragon: gimme some of that crystal......light
02:11  LordDragon: alexlea, hehe. its strawberry orange banana flavor. *shares*
02:11  terr_: alexlea: I can send you a carton on how to find a meth lab
02:12  Swian: meth? you wanna kill yourself?
02:14  terr_: LordDragon: back to biz!  I take my firewire drive and set it up as a boot device which means someone I don't know yet knows how to do this and then I borrow a machine and piddle.  This sounds like a good plan which will work but what my idea was is simple a boot image that can run unser say VMWare
02:14  alexlea: Swian: meth doesnt kill you...anyway we were actually talking about crystal light
02:14  terr_: Swian: I can kill myself real easy with the meds I have hgere!  No kidding.  
02:15  Swian: don't do it
02:15  jordanisawesome: mac suckss!
02:15  Swian: you do to
02:15  alexlea: so
02:16  Swian: and you spell poorly
02:16  alexlea: lots of things suck...exept your gf jordanisawesome
02:16  Swian: nice
02:16  terr_: Acetomenophen will kill.  I have several drug printouts and I'm a little pissed.  Seems they can't even write a med warnign without having some sort of stupid adjenda.  No information.. just fear tactics
02:16  jordanisawesome: hey macfag, at least i have a gf
02:17  Swian: no you don't
02:17  Swian: but your left hand is lonely
02:17  alexlea: jordanisawesome: i'm not gay, so of course i have no gf :P
02:17  terr_: Swian: I am real careful.  I told the doctor what I want.  Oxiconton.. 5mg no percocet because Acetomenophen can dissolve your liver.
02:18  alexlea: terr_: they make percocets with ibuprofin instead...not called percocets. but same thing
02:18  Swian: terr_ I like oxicotnton, but I'm careful
02:18  alexlea: oxycodone
02:18  terr_: Swian: My lefthand is loney too.  My right arm hardly works.
02:18  alexlea: i have never done oxycontinin
02:18  Swian: hehe
02:19  Swian: bummer
02:19  jordanisawesome: OS X is stupid
02:19  alexlea: jordanisawesome: only unhappy people go into mac rooms and yell mac sux, or call people macfags...kinda the same as the people who go into the windows room and insult them....
02:19  Swian: you are too but we don't say anything
02:19  terr_: Swian: I have them.  Also a good friend does medical research - he's a prof of Neuroscience at the UofA.  I am shocked at the pamphlets.  
02:20  alexlea: jordanisawesome: if you are lonely and wanna talk and hang out, if you are nice yo might have more fun :)
02:20  Swian: I have some and I've gotten them for my RA
02:20  Swian: or Jordanisawesome we can ask an op to have you shown the door
02:22  Swian: started a nwe job in Nov, everyone is on macs but my group of 6
02:22  Swian: nwe = new
02:22  terr_: Swian: The Oxi works.  Codene doesn't.  Codeine is at 30 mg and Oxi at 5 and I can take 2.5 and it works.  Had I not done the reseach and followed the prescription I could be fascing a liver transplant because I was prescribed about 4 GRAMS of acetomenophen per day!!! and it doesn't work.  2.5 mg Oxicodone works.
02:22  fujiosano: what job?
02:23  Swian: .Net developer, but most of the company is built around php
02:23  fujiosano: o ok
02:23  Swian: I'm cool with it
02:23  Swian: terr_ what is your condition?
02:24  LordDragon: jordanisawesome, obvious troll is obvious
02:24  alexlea: insulting trolls is 2 wrongs
02:24  alexlea: 2 wrongs don't make a right, blah blah....
02:24  terr_: alexlea: I have never taken Tylenol before and never Ibuprofin.  Nerver had Oxicodone eiither.
02:24 * alexlea fights back with happy thoughts
02:24  alexlea: terr_: oxicodone ispercocets
02:25  Swian: I take buprofin often
02:25  alexlea: i eat ibuprofin like candy
02:25  alexlea: well, 3 a day
02:25  LordDragon: alexlea, i agree sort. ideally the best response to a troll is to ignore and immediately remove it from the channel. but since no ops are around, i'll settle for expose how unskilled the troll is :)
02:25  alexlea: sometimes 4...for sinus headaches
02:25  Swian: but I have RA
02:25  fujiosano: RA??
02:25  Swian: Rheumatoid Arthtitis
02:26  LordDragon: alexlea, i dont know what just happened, but my previous statement had awful grammer. lol
02:26  Swian: spelled that wrong
02:26  jordanisawesome: LordDragon: yep
02:26  fujiosano: rheumatoid arthritis 
02:26  fujiosano: :D
02:26  Swian: right
02:26  alexlea: LordDragon: i want everyone to be happy, or at least not miserable... some "trolls" are just unhappy people and might benefit form someone being nce, and when every mass attacks a troll, or troll like person, it makes them NO better
02:26  fujiosano: my sister has that i was never tested for it
02:27  alexlea: i mean, it makes the attackers no better
02:27  Swian: I have it, felt it bad last winter got tested
02:27  alexlea: EVERYONE can be nice, and EVERYONE can be mean...no one is ALL bad
02:27  terr_: Swian: The main power breaker in my house gave out Nov 18.  I put a chicken in the oven and the breaker started to trip.  I got a new one in the afternoon bnut had a dinner meeting and it was 9:30 and dark when I got home.  So I figured I would swap it next day.  9:30 I a,m walking downstairs and the breaker trips and I am inm the dark and I go to turn to go back upstairs because I
02:27  Swian: went vegetarian, which has helped
02:28  Swian: terr_ I don't get it
02:28  Velociraptors: alexlea: kindness does wonders :)
02:28  terr_: 'm 1/2 way downstairs and I fell.  I did a swan dive.  I landed on my shoulder and did a Class V AC shoulder separation.  I had surgery on Nov 25.
02:28  LordDragon: alexlea, i disagree. trolls are born from ppl that have low self esteem, and rather than doing something about it, they prefer to insult others to make themselves feel better. the best thing u can do for a troll is to show them that their method is ineffective and wont be tolerated. sooner or later they will grow up and move on. but as long as ppl feed the troll, it will encourage further gay behavoir
02:28  Swian: ouch
02:28  Swian: ok NOW I get it
02:29  osxdude: Finally
02:29  terr_: Swian: I'm on these meds for pain.  I have titanium on m shoulder... and screws through the bones.
02:29  osxdude: after Flash causes an Ethernet-destroying problem
02:29  osxdude: I have my Mac back
02:29  osxdude: lol
02:29  Swian: terr_ I can relate, some nights hurts just to lie down
02:29  Velociraptors: Speaking of bones - http://chaosdominium.blogspot.com/2010/06/fibrodysplasia-ossificans-progressiva.html
02:30  alexlea: LordDragon: yeah, thats now how i see it.
02:30  alexlea: LordDragon: strictness NEVER worked on me growing up
02:30  alexlea: it just made me wanna rebel more
02:30  alexlea: made me more angry, etc
02:31  alexlea: LordDragon: i have/had ADD, which means i was never quite acurate on how to act in public..i simply didnt get it or understand,so made MANY social faux pas....and al people did was act rude towards me
02:32  alexlea: i have been called "obnoxious and annoying" more times than i can count
02:33  torchie: obnoxious and annoying...
02:33  torchie: ...or aggressive and persistent
02:33 * torchie FREFRAME
02:33  torchie: fwoooosh
02:33  LordDragon: alexlea, i think its different with internet trolls. its not like the trolls dont know any better. they KNOW their behavoir is inappropriate and they KNOW they are annoying ppl and causing a disruption. thats the whole point, and its why they choose the obvious things to say to get a reaction. they know full well what they are doing, so I dont have any sympathy for them
02:33  Velociraptors: LordDragon: now you're trolling
02:33  alexlea: LordDragon: well, when people are confused, unhappy, etc they"act out"
02:33  alexlea: doesnt make them bad people
02:33  alexlea: not always
02:33  Velociraptors: (kidding)_
02:34  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i would never troll :)
02:34  alexlea: LordDragon: what exactly are you doing when you say "obvious troll is obvious" tho...i mean, why not just type /ignore
02:34  Swian: i like ignore
02:35  alexlea: no one is above reproach is my point, we all mess up
02:35  terr_: swan RA is different... mightbe autoimmune.
02:35  Swian: I have RA
02:35  Swian: was tested
02:35  Swian: and not Swan, Swian
02:36  LordDragon: alexlea, well. like i said. the preferred option for dealing with a troll is to immediately remove it from the channel. but when that isnt possible, the only alternative left is to beat the troll at its own game and thereby prevent it from acheiving its objective
02:36  terr_: Swan... for me this will be over in a month... well -by then I will be able to lift a broom.  So far I can comb my hair and brush my teeth.
02:36  Swian: not Swan
02:36  alexlea: LordDragon: you cant beat most trolls, because attepting to beat them is exactly what is wanted
02:36  alexlea: LordDragon: i feel like we are a country and we are negotiating our countries national troll policy...LOL
02:37  LordDragon: alexlea, i disagree. what they want is to get an outraged reaction. ppl acting annoyed. what they DONT want is to be trolled THEMSELVES and THEM be the ones manipulated
02:37  jordanisawesome: Linux FTW
02:37  Velociraptors: LordDragon: what they want is kittens
02:37  LordDragon: alexlea, lol
02:37  rryouumaa: LordDragon: agree on how to deal with it but disagree on your theory.  i think the problem is that trolls have high self-esteem.  they genuinely think they're superior in a primal sort of way.  this is why they think they have the right to harm or annoy others.
02:37 * alexlea gives jordanisawesome a kitten
02:37  LordDragon: Velociraptors, hahaha. yes the world needs more kittens for sure :)
02:38  Velociraptors: not here!
02:38  terr_: Swan - but for me this will be over soon.  In a month I see the doctor and by then I think my shoulder will be a story of success.  In the mean time I am toally serious that I can handle a virtual machine but I can't even lift a mac pro much less much more than a pencil.  I am learning what it is like to be invalid.
02:38  alexlea: rryouumaa: hmmm
02:38  Velociraptors: I'd like fewer kittens here - and cats.
02:38 * jordanisawesome gives alexlea a middle finger
02:38  Swian: ok terr_, please, my name is NOT swan
02:38  LordDragon: hahaha
02:38  LordDragon: Swian, your feathers are looking lovely today
02:38  terr_: Swian: sorry!
02:38  LordDragon: :P
02:38  Swian: thanks
02:39  Swian: :)
02:39  staticsafe: np: Show Biz Kids by Steely Dan [Countdown To Ecstasy]
02:39  staticsafe: xD
02:39  Swian: love Steely Dan
02:39  LordDragon: crilly or ChrisAM. you guys around? we have another obvious troll
02:39  terr_: Swian: am I correct that Ra might be an autoimmune condit~ion?
02:39  alexlea: LordDragon: eventually  i do believe in your approach...i guess i just believe in attemting kindness initially
02:39 @ChrisAM: LordDragon ... Is it really that tough to just ignore someone?
02:39  Swian: terr_ it is
02:40 @ChrisAM: You cause more of a disturbance than the troll.
02:40 * jordanisawesome asks alexlea why she isn't in the kitchen
02:40  staticsafe: TingPing: welcome to the party
02:40 --- ChrisAM sets modes [##mac +q *!*@ool-4a5a22f2.dyn.optonline.net]
02:41  terr_: Swian: I have vitalogo.  No big deal.  There are things I've come across that give me ideas.
02:41  terr_: Swian: I have heard bee stings cna cure RA
02:41  LordDragon: ChrisAM, i wasnt making a disturbance. i was raising awareness
02:42  LordDragon: ChrisAM, ops are supposed to clear the channel of trolls and abusers. not just sit and watch them have their fun
02:42  terr_: LordDragon: theory no doubt
02:43  alexlea: well,that jordan guy was cleared yesterdya and he came back...thast why /ignore is a better option...
02:43  terr_: Swian: offtopic here but how bad is your RA?
02:43 @ChrisAM: Trolls are only effective if they get a response.
02:43  alexlea: anyone can use shell accounts, proxies, etc and come right back
02:44  rryouumaa: there are people whose goal is to discredit a person or a group or spread false information.  even if htey don't get a response they need slapping sometimes.  don't you agree?
02:44  LordDragon: ChrisAM, that is incorrect. even if no one replies, the troll KNOWS his abuse comments were seen and read. thats enough for most trolls. the whole channel is not gonna ignore each troll that comes along. the only effective way to deal with them is to remove them asap from the channel
02:45  alexlea: um
02:45  Velociraptors: How about those Mac Pros then?
02:45  alexlea: Velociraptors: i wnat one
02:45  alexlea: actually a macbook pro
02:45  Swian: terr_ since going vegeterian not bad, but when I cheat, bad
02:45  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i think the world would be a better place if everyone had a mac pro. i say, mac pros all around! :)
02:45  terr_: alexlea: I liked the suggestion of the firewire drive.  My friends are not techogymnatsts.  While I am happy to play with their CPU I don't want to touch their hard drives.
02:46  terr_: alexlea: apparently I have one on offer for say $600?
02:46  staticsafe: who honestly still uses Firewire anymore?
02:46  alexlea: ?
02:46  b0o-yeah: LordDragon: yeah I don't like +q unless its obvious that someone's cat is walking on their keyboard 
02:46  Swian: I have one on my wife's Mac Mini
02:46  b0o-yeah: staticsafe: wtf ... me
02:47  staticsafe: <.<
02:47  staticsafe: >.>
02:47  Swian: its nice
02:47  b0o-yeah: FW is great
02:47  staticsafe: Tell me why Apple is the only PC manufacturer that includes them then?
02:47  terr_: Swian: I was offered two (2) books to read... on this... later.  I want to go through the data.  When I hear claims like this I want to go through the data.
02:47  staticsafe: well some HP desktops have them
02:47  staticsafe: but still
02:47  b0o-yeah: huh my asus mobo has fw
02:47  Swian: 160gb FW is nice
02:48  b0o-yeah: also umm a thing called i-link
02:48  staticsafe: 1TB USB 2.0 drive is nice xD
02:48  staticsafe: firewire is hardly mainstream wouldn't you agree then?
02:48  Swian: terr_ I went for vegeterian and my wife did since she is Type 1 Diabetic and the research we did led us to try it, worked out for both of us
02:49  Swian: FW is faster than USB 2
02:49  staticsafe: heh
02:49  b0o-yeah: faster and less cpu usage 
02:49  alexlea: speaking of being a vegatearina, i saw a youtube vid link (never watche dthe vid but read about it) about people in asia eating live fish
02:49  alexlea: they fry these fish, WHILE ALIVE, and eat themWHILE ALIVE...i was traumatised
02:49  alexlea: most HORRIBLE thing ever
02:50  terr_: Swian: Fw is faster than USB 2.0 and not 3.0
02:50  Swian: yes I agree terr_
02:50  staticsafe: USB 3.0 will blow Firewire out of the water 
02:50  staticsafe: :S
02:50  b0o-yeah: FW3200
02:50  Swian: but I don't have UBS 3
02:50  staticsafe: I think some new motherboards have them now
02:51  staticsafe: it's still not common
02:51  b0o-yeah: oh wait intel what about lightpeak? . . . oh you forgot
02:51  terr_: Swian: I'm in ther fence when it comes to veggie  Some of this makes sense.
02:51  LordDragon: alexlea, they taste better when they riggle in your mouth :P
02:51  Swian: terr_ I can say it made a change, BIG change, for me
02:52  Swian: I would love to eat meat more often
02:52  Swian: but, the pain is gone
02:52  alexlea: terr_: why on the fence? what are your main pros/cons
02:52  Swian: its a tough change
02:53  terr_: staticsafe: Why was Apple here?  They were here for SCSI also.  Apple knows what they are doing.  But they are High Price which is what HP stands for.
02:53  alexlea: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6595481/Chinese-diners-eat-live-fish-in-YouTube-video.html  HORRIBLE fish thing. you wont see anything messedu p unless you click the vid link on it though
02:53  alexlea: LordDragon: stop it
02:53  LordDragon: alexlea, aw just teasing
02:54  alexlea: i never watched teh video, i couldnt
02:54  alexlea: i used to have a fish tank, and had koi (which are carp, which is the same kinda fish in here) and koi can learn ticks they remeber people, etc....
02:55  alexlea: eating meat is one thing....but eating it while its still alive and feeling, i just dont understand some people
02:55  terr_: alexlea: I've gone to many veggie meeting and find most left wing get togthers.  But I am so a-political I'm not sure I can tell.  I always thought I was right wing.  Maybe I'm the third wing!
02:56  Swian: never been to a veggie meeting
02:56  alexlea: terr_: you are not making any sense to me..
02:56  alexlea: never knew there were veggie meeitngs
02:56  Swian: I cut out meat for the fat content
02:56  Swian: not a political reason
02:57  alexlea: why cut out fat?
02:57  Swian: RA
02:57  Swian: fat = pain
02:57  alexlea: Swian: really?
02:57  Swian: yeah
02:57  alexlea: fat in foods causes pain
02:57  alexlea: ???
02:57  Swian: it does for me
02:57  alexlea: how?
02:57  torchie: fat is delicious
02:58  alexlea: i have never heard f this, can you explain it Swian
02:58  Swian: I have Rheumatoid Arthritis
02:58  Swian: and the more fat in my diet the more it hurts
02:58  alexlea: Swian: is it all fat, or only certain kinds
02:58  Swian: mostly animal fats
02:58  alexlea: like, will avacado fat and bana fat affect you the same was as bacon greese?
02:58  alexlea: ok,
02:58  Swian: but I try and limit all fats
02:59  staticsafe: Swian: you're missing out on all the delicious fat. :P
02:59  Swian: I know I LOVE ribs
02:59  alexlea: i hate fat
02:59  alexlea: the flavor, etc
02:59  alexlea: well, meat fat
03:00  Swian: I live in the south BBQ is big here
03:00  alexlea: i like avacados alot
03:00  alexlea: Swian: where in the south
03:00  Swian: Florida
03:00  terr_: Swian: maybe red meat is an issue.  May I suggest you add mamu edible fungus to your diet.  Maybe look for one that are cellulose digesters.
03:00  alexlea: oh yeah, 
03:00  Swian: I don't eat red meat
03:00  terr_: Swian: s/mamu/many/
03:01  Swian: wich is what terr_?
03:01  alexlea: i am mostly vegetarian, but last night my boyfriend made a huge well done hamburger, and couldnt finish it, and it smelled sooo good, so "please cows forgive me for eating yoru brother" i finished it
03:01  staticsafe: fresh beef or mutton is the best
03:01  staticsafe: <3
03:01  Swian: I'm not vegetarian for moral reasons
03:01  alexlea: it was the first time in a long time that i had red meat....
03:01  terr_: Swian: like Shittaki..  Oyster... Flamulina Veloptipes
03:02  Swian: I do sushi
03:02  terr_: Swian: I'm tryimg to remember the common name
03:02  alexlea: Swian: for me, all my aspirations are about teh animals.... health i could care less about
03:02  alexlea: well, i care about health, but like, its not a concern, because i eat pretty healthy naturally
03:02  terr_: Swian: Paddie straw !
03:02  Swian: raw fish, but the fish oils are good
03:03  terr_: Swian: yes  Omega III
03:03  staticsafe: alexlea: what do you mean by the fact that you care for animals?
03:03  staticsafe: I don't get your point
03:03  alexlea: staticsafe: i want tobe vegetarian because i dont wanna kill aniamls
03:03  staticsafe: ah
03:03  Swian: we're carnivores
03:03  staticsafe: we are omnivores
03:04  terr_: staticsafe: I care for them too.  I like them.  I like them in my deep freeze.  But I don't eatr them often.  I am moving towars where Swian is and I don't eat red meat very often.
03:04  alexlea: yeh, well we are also rapists, violent, etc...doesnt mean we all have to partake 
03:04  staticsafe: I never really understood the morality behind being a vegetarian
03:04  staticsafe: it eludes me
03:04  Swian: I don't do it out of a sense of morality
03:05  Swian: I like meat
03:05  alexlea: staticsafe: well, it can definatey be refuted mainly because rodents, aka one of my fav animals, are killed constantly when fields are plowed
03:05  terr_: alexlea: I am not of his group.  I am also not a pschcopath so this probably means I am not qualified to be a pollie
03:05  alexlea: IE vegetarian is NO MORE humane than eating meat
03:06  staticsafe: heh
03:06  staticsafe: never thought of that
03:06  Swian: maybe too sensitive a topic
03:06  Swian: I bow out
03:06  alexlea: there are some practical reasons to eat less meat, such as the amount of grain it takes to feed the meat
03:07  alexlea: to produce a pounf of meat, you use something like 100 pounds of grains....i am kmaking uyp numbers, google for accurate ones...but point is more wasteful
03:07  terr_: You guys are tyring to write literature into biology.
03:07  Swian: google isn't 100% accurate
03:07  alexlea: terr_: are you on the one on narcotics
03:07  alexlea: if so, its reallyshowing
03:07  terr_: alexlea: low blow!
03:08  alexlea: terr_: i am serious, you are speaking in a wya that is pretty incoherent to me
03:08  Swian: this is a least an INTERESTING channe;
03:08  Swian: channel
03:08  Swian: good discussions
03:08  terr_: alexlea: hat hurtz.    Not as much as my shoulder but my friend is a crown prosecutor and I['d love to hear that line in court!
03:09  alexlea: terr_: i wasnt trying to be mean...
03:09  Swian: everyone has an opinion
03:09  Swian: it doesn't make anyone wrong
03:09 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
03:09  alexlea: terr_: explain "You guys are tyring to write literature into biology."
03:09  terr_: alexlea: it was not taken that way.  I am just sitting at my desk with my pain.  LOL
03:09  staticsafe: ohello Tomis 
03:09  alexlea: terr_: :D
03:10  alexlea: Swian: i am literally confused by him
03:10  alexlea: Swian: and why are you bowing out
03:10  Swian: I can relate, but I love debates that make me re-thing positions
03:11  Swian: I'm new here don't wanna get on the down side
03:11  Swian: re-think!
03:12  alexlea: down side?
03:12  Swian: alexlea bad side, piss people off
03:13  torchie: meat is delicious
03:13  alexlea: Swian: you wont. avoid hackintosh, piracy, and ultea crude language and you will be fine
03:13  torchie: man you guys ever have beef
03:13  torchie: beef is great
03:13  Swian: personally my opionion is I like to eat meat, but I can't do it anymore
03:13  alexlea: i cant speak for everyone, but Swian, its not necessary that we all think alike...there are ebates/arguments all the time
03:13  Swian: but it is not out of a sense of guilt
03:13  staticsafe: torchie: fresh beef is the greatest
03:13  staticsafe: xD
03:14  alexlea: torchie: i had beef last nigt
03:15  torchie: how was it
03:15  alexlea: against my will...it's smell seduced me
03:15  Swian: I have not had beef in more than 2 years
03:15  barathron: Moo
03:15  Swian: I've had chicken and turkey on occasion, but not beef or pork
03:16  torchie: chicken's pretty good too
03:16  terr_: Swian: I think I hopped on the slippery slope first.  I came here lookin for a HackenMac.  All I want is a test drive. Why should life be so difficult  
03:16  Swian: my kids have it, I don't want to force them into my diet
03:16  terr_: Swian: cod liver oil.  But I like it!
03:17  Swian: I haven't had MUCH chicken or turkey in 2 years, but the few times I had some meat that's what is was
03:17  Swian: I think I need some more vodka tho :)
03:17  Swian: and I'm having cod tomorrow night
03:17  alexlea: wow lag
03:18  torchie: Swian: battered?
03:18  alexlea: Swian: vodka is goof for ra?
03:19  alexlea: Swian: i had some vegetarian beed, tasted almost identical to beef, it was used in a stew....maybe you could get some of that
03:19  alexlea: beef*
03:19  fujiosano: http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/06/one-danish-tabloids-beef-with-apple/#more-45807
03:19  alexlea: the vegetarian people are getting better at replicating meat
03:20  Swian: vodka is good for me
03:20  b3ny0-: but nothing replaces meat but real meat
03:20  alexlea: I am reading about RA, its sayng fish oil fish oil and more fish oil

03:21  Swian: and I love FISH oil
03:21  Swian: no, not battered cod
03:21  Swian: but breaded
03:21  Swian: and baked
03:21  alexlea: i used to live in Berkeley, and at at the Krishna temple EVERYDAY for like 3 months...before that i didnt think being a vegtarian was possible...cause my past attempts involved simply removing the meat...ie i would cook a meal, and just not eat the meat
03:21 * Branes has a small portion of lamb or kangaroo once every 6-8 weeks, hasn't eaten beef in over a decade

03:25  alexlea: staticsafe: eggplant tastes ike whatever you make it in; ie in eggplant lasgna it soaks up the sauce
03:25  alexlea: eggplant has no real flavor of its own

03:27  Swian: my wife took 2 years to get me into it
03:27  terr_: Swian: I'e been up at 5:P30 everdamn morning since my accident and make poached eggs with white sauce and ham or bacon and this gives me the lift to face the narcs!  and stare them down.
03:27  fujiosano: crab is something you buy alive
03:27  fujiosano: and then cook
03:27  fujiosano: :<
03:27  fujiosano: kind cruel
03:27  Swian: poached eggs huh?
03:27  Swian: I don't like eggs
03:27  Swian: they look great, smell great, but I can't eat em
03:27  terr_: Swian: I want to give you the Norwiegin White Sauce recipe
03:28  Swian: give it
03:28  terr_: Okay... all you other guys hook yer pencils to yer finmgers... this will be quick.
03:28  Swian: cool
03:28  Swian: love new recipes
03:29  terr_: Frying pan.  Cast iron because our blood needs the iron.  Toss in some butter or marg.  Add about 50:50 white flur and toast it reasl light.
03:29  fujiosano: Swian:  i make my own noodle soup with seafood mix and sweet soya sauce for breakfasting :o
03:30  Swian: let me say again, great channel, good chats
03:30  Swian: I have cast iron
03:30  fujiosano: you ever had marinaded deer rug ?
03:30  fujiosano: it's like supertasty
03:31 +Tomis: what's that inuendo for fujiosano 
03:31  fujiosano: Tomis: ?
03:31  Swian: keep going terr_
03:31  terr_: This makes a french Roux or something like that because I am 1/2 french and I'm proud of it and Ican't spell bnut I can do math and can kind of unravel the socks of  the English teachers.
03:31  fujiosano: Tomis:  no inuendo
03:32  terr_: So - fry up some flour.  Like this is difficult?
03:32  terr_: Light toast.  Really light.
03:32  Swian: I know how to make a rouxe
03:32  fujiosano: shrimps in dough with sweet chili sauce :o
03:32  fujiosano: those make nice snacks
03:32  alexlea: i am gonna make zuchini cakes tonight
03:33  staticsafe: Apple pie ftw
03:33  staticsafe: and cake
03:33  staticsafe: but the cake is a lie :(
03:33  Swian: gonna make fish and chips tomorrow night
03:34  Swian: got some nice cod
03:34  fujiosano: Swian:  you English?
03:34  Swian: no
03:34  Swian: american/irish
03:34  fujiosano: irish :O
03:35  terr_: Next. Into a pot.  Add say say a cup or to of milk.  There is lots of elbow room here.  Add say about 1/2 tsp salt per cup of milk.  Add a TBSP or two of the fried up flour.  Hey - nobody says this is not creative.
03:36  fujiosano: you guys know that custard porridge ?
03:36  Swian: I know I need more beer
03:36  fujiosano: i dont drink alcohol anymore but i cook with wine sometimes
03:36  Swian: or something to eat
03:37  terr_: When it is thich and looks loke a lovely French sauce then add 1 TSP to 1 TBSP mustard.  Never cook mustard.  
03:38  terr_: This is the sauce eggs pine for
03:38  terr_: Swian: this is the white sauce that fish pine for.
03:39  torchie: what about humans
03:39  fujiosano: torchie: i dont eat any primates
03:39  torchie: but do primates find the sauce delicious
03:40  fujiosano: torchie:  did you know that certain primates have human rights in Spain in their laws?
03:40  fujiosano: amazing huh...
03:40  terr_: torchie: try mine
03:40  torchie: remind me never to go to spain if I can't eat a monkey
03:40  alexlea: speaking of primates, i was reading baout hybrid animals, chromozones, and people with down syndrome yesterday....i think i am making progress in my search for truth
03:40  fujiosano: http://www.monkeyday.org/2008/06/spains-parliament-votes-to-extend-human.html
03:41  KeeperOfTheSoul: anyone got a recommened package system for OSX?
03:41  fujiosano: Parliament's environmental committee approved resolutions urging Spain to comply with the Great Apes Project, devised by scientists and philosophers who say our closest genetic relatives deserve rights hitherto limited to humans.
03:41  alexlea: i think human rights should extend to all living creatires
03:41  alexlea: ^^ fujiosano
03:41  alexlea: well, except like ants...otherwise we would all be in prison
03:41  fujiosano: yeah sure
03:42  torchie: I think human rights should extend to all electronics manufactured before 1994
03:42  fujiosano: Spain is the only country to have done this
03:42  alexlea: fujiosano: were youhere when i linked the live fish eating thing
03:43  fujiosano: nope dont think so
03:43  Swian: I don't wanna eat anything alive
03:43  alexlea: fujiosano: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/15/peta-priority-live-seafoo_n_538631.html
03:43  alexlea: fujiosano: i syumbled on this accidentally...i never watched the vid
03:44  alexlea: fujiosano: i just read about it
03:49  alexlea: wrong link http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/17/eating-a-deep-fried-fish_n_360576.html
03:51  Swian: ok, that's crazy
03:52  alexlea: on youtube, i saw remarks about how "in the coean, the fish are eaten alive by other fish, so its no big deal"
03:52  alexlea: i cant see it that way
03:52  alexlea: ocean*
03:52  Swian: nope
03:52  Swian: not working for me
03:53  alexlea: i think it's horrible...i am still disturbed about it
03:53  alexlea: last night, when isaw the vid link by accidnt i thought/hoped it was a hoax
03:53  Swian: yeah not into that for ANY reason
03:53  alexlea: i just couldnt believe ANYONE could do this
03:54  Swian: I can't even think about that
03:54  Swian: just not something I could do
03:55  alexlea: i think people are able to because they are in denial, they really believe animals are super different, and that they dont have pain, etc
03:56  alexlea: especially  creatires that look so bizarre like fish, octopus, etc
03:58  alexlea: you know, i am not even sure that animals do this...everything i am seeing about carnivores is about going in for the "kill"
03:59  Swian: I don't think like that
03:59  Swian: I could eat meat, but I am aware and understand that the animal feels pain
04:00  alexlea: Swian: yeah most people don't think that way...cause it hink most people find this torturing fish thing bad
04:00  alexlea: i dunno about asians, etc...which is where this happens, cause i dont know their culture first hand
04:01  Swian: I like fish and I FISH but I try not to hurt any fish
04:02  alexlea: how do you minimise pain when fishing? are they killed instantly after being reeled in
04:02  Swian: If I plan to keep and eat it its goes on ice to numb it
04:02  giaco: hello! I'm new to osx, but I know gnu linux. I've a question, I want to disable startup services that drains my battery life ( such as adobe updater ), I know that the startup programs should be in options -> account page, but it is not there and there may be another place where osx looks for startup program. Could you tell me how to clean my startup?
04:04  alexlea: giaco: http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx//arch_startup.html
04:04  Swian: alexlea I can only say how I do it, It seems humane to me, but may not to you
04:05  alexlea: Swian: i cannot speak authoritively, but as far as i know, putting them on ice is not pleasant from what i have read
04:05  giaco: alexlea, thank you
04:05  alexlea: Swian: its similar to a method people kill pet fish, they put themin hte freezer,in a bag of water, and supposedly they go numb, then die....but other people have said that while their internal oragans are crystallizing, its painful
04:06  Swian: I don't know, I can't think of any pleasant way o die
04:06 +Tomis: system prefs>accounts>login items giaco 
04:06  Swian: I do NOT keep what I don't intend to eat
04:06 +Tomis: for system-wide startup items, you could look int /library/startupitems
04:07  Swian: I'm not a fish
04:07  giaco: Tomis, no, wrong, that's only the user processes, it doesn't cover all non-default installed startup services
04:07 +Tomis: as i said, look into startup items folder for system wide staryup items
04:07  giaco: alexlea, that guide seems old, it's not talking about launchd nor launchd Daemons and Agents
04:07  alexlea: giaco: listen to tomis instead then :)
04:08  alexlea: i never knew about that.... Tomis now i know
04:10 +Tomis: oh, and it looks like i didn't uninstal some app completely and it left a litle driver behind in there
04:10  giaco: Tomis, I've found some launch stuff inside Library/LaunchDeamons and Library/LaunchAgents. Do you know how do they work?
04:10 +Tomis: i'm not familiar with the subtleties of those parts of the system giaco 
04:11 +Tomis: i do know that there are 3rd party apps for making it easier to manage such things
04:12  alexlea: giaco: since you are asking us, i wouldnt mess with them
04:12 +Tomis: i'd just throw out the stuff you don't want starting
04:12 +Tomis: adobe crapware doesn't need to be running on system boot
04:13 +Tomis: nor does google's similarly designed version checker dameon
04:14  giaco: Tomis, exactly, I just want apple stuff in there
04:14 +Tomis: then trash it all
04:15  alexlea: Swian: well, apparently ice is the most humane way, since they are to be eaten...pet fish dont get eaten which i guess is why it was all about being anti ice
04:15  Swian: ok, great discussions, but I'm out, night all
04:15  alexlea: Swian: i am doing google research...
04:15 +Tomis: the stuff in /library/ is all 3rd party stuff that needs to be system wide
04:15  alexlea: night
04:15 +Tomis: ~/library/ is for the given user
04:15 +Tomis:  /system/library/ is for the core of the system, and shouldn't be touched
04:15  giaco: Tomis, but it seems to me that I have non-out-of-the-box stuff in /system/library/Launch* , but I'm not sure
04:16  Swian: ok, night alexlea GREAT chatting with you, love not seeing eye to eye
04:16 +Tomis: yes, that happens when you instal 3rd party apps/services which need to run at boot giaco 
04:16  alexlea: i'm out too....
04:17 +Tomis: so uninstal those apps, configure them differently, or just remove those entries entirely
04:17 +Tomis: if you just remove the entries, those apps may squak at you, ask to reinstal their launch service, or they may just reinstal it silently
04:19  giaco: Tomis, ok, but I need to find out which one is standard and which one isn't before ... actually I don't know
04:19 +Tomis: that's easy
04:19 +Tomis: none of them are system services
04:19 +Tomis: they're all 3rd party
04:20  giaco: Tomis, I'm talking about stuff in /System/Library/Launch* ... are you sure of that?
04:20 +Tomis: don't touch that folder giaco 
04:21 +Tomis: only /library/ and ~/library/ should you be looking to modify
04:21  giaco: I've already cleared up /Library/Launch* and ~/Library/Launch*
04:21  giaco: k
04:21 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
04:21  giaco: I understand that /System/Library/Launch* is system-critical, but I'm sure that there's non-standard stuff in there
04:22 +Tomis: no, there should not be 3rd party entries under the /system/ directory
04:23 +Tomis: there would be no reason to do so, /library/ serves the same function, and keeps everything clean and sepperate
04:24  neekers: i bought a netgear wireless router with usb hard drive, my windows machine sees the hard drive but my macbook doesn't, how do i connect to that hard drive on the wireless router?
04:24 +Tomis: how is it being shared
04:25  neekers: boy, thats a good question... i read the 48 page manual that came with the router and it doesn't even mention the "ShareReady" usb port
04:26  neekers: how can a user manual leave out such a big part of a product?
04:26 +Tomis: look into the config pages of the thing
04:26 +Tomis: might be something to choose what protocols it uses
04:26  neekers: looking
04:26  giaco: Tomis, I have a org.x.startx.plist file in my /System/Library/LaunchAgents folder. Do you think that's a "standard" file?
04:27 +Tomis: yes, that's for the X windowing system, installed by default with mac os x giaco 
04:27  giaco: I think that file comes from MacPort somehow
04:27  giaco: oh, ok
04:27 +Tomis: no, there's no need for 3rd parties to modify /system/
04:27  giaco: ok
04:27 +Tomis: and likewise, i'd advise you not modifying it either
04:27  giaco: thank you for your explanation
04:27  mininessie: x11 sucks
04:28  giaco: I won't, just trying to understand
04:28 +Tomis: open activity monitor.app
04:28 +Tomis: that'll give you a better idea of what's actually running
04:28 +Tomis: once you've thrown out un-needed services like that adobe updater crap, you're done with that step
04:29 +Tomis: you'll get better battery life by turning the backlight down, turning off things you don't need like bluetooth, etc.
04:30  giaco: absolutely
04:30  giaco: I'm going to reboot my mac
04:30  mininessie: is it bad to leave your macbook pro plugged in all the time
04:31 +Tomis: yes mininessie 
04:31  mininessie: Tomis: how so
04:31 +Tomis: if you use it plugged in 24-7 then make sure you drain the battery fully at least once a month
04:31 +Tomis: see http://apple.com/batteries for more battery care tips
04:31  mininessie: Tomis: okay will do that 
04:40  torchie: we should just like
04:40  torchie: fix batteries
04:41  torchie: BOOM
04:42  giaco: question: http://images.apple.com/batteries/images/notebookenergy20060324.gif . here I see options that I don't have. I mean the top one
04:42  giaco: "setting for" and "optimization"
04:50  nownot: is there a way to export a playlist from an iphone/itouch?
04:51  giaco: nevermind, googled an answer
04:51  giaco: rebooting, bye!
05:48  Kimbo1986_: hey i have a question
05:48  Kimbo1986_: I was thinking about moving all my audio recording software into a separate partion on my momentusXT
05:49  Kimbo1986_: problem is, lots of the software call for files in the library folders and user folders
05:49  Kimbo1986_: I dont want to move all those folders and cause any issues with system or other non audio programs at that
05:50  Kimbo1986_: so would the idea of putting the software into a separate partion and then maybe placing an Alias in the main drive to link to the other partion
05:50  Kimbo1986_: Where other non audio programs will go into the audio recording partion, and the audio recording partian will take directly from there
05:51  Kimbo1986_: anyone understand what I am saying
05:51  Adman65: Hey, anyone using macvim? http://pastie.org/1369346
05:51 +Branes: An alias is usually insufficient.
05:51  Kimbo1986_: and is partioning the drive really that beneficial
05:51 +Branes: Not really.
05:51  Kimbo1986_: :/
05:51  Kimbo1986_: yea seems like a hassle to do all of that for little to no performance boost
05:52 +Branes: You'd notice virtually no improvement, despite DAWs being I/O-bound.
05:52  Kimbo1986_: right
05:52  Kimbo1986_: Well I use 100's of gigs in samples when mixing
05:52 +Branes: More memory would be more beneficial, and adding another storage interface bus would definitely help.
05:53  Kimbo1986_: so I dont know sometimes it can drag if im running a large project
05:53 +Branes: What Mac?
05:53  Kimbo1986_: I only run 8gb ram
05:53  Kimbo1986_: right now im doing a lot of mobile stuff so im on a mbp lol
05:53 +Branes: That'd actually be better than an iMac :)
05:54  Kimbo1986_: threw a hybrid drive in there and maxed the ram to help out a bit
05:54 +Branes: If your MBP has an ExpressCard slot, get an FW800 or eSATA interface for it, and put your sample libraries on a fast external.
05:55  Kimbo1986_: hmm, I didnt think you could do that
05:55 +Branes: Sure.
05:55  Kimbo1986_: Someone was telling me to swap the optical drive and throw ssd in it
05:55  Kimbo1986_: but I dont think its going to help a whole lot, i mean i know its fast but for the price and the space I need
05:56  Kimbo1986_: Im not going to spend as much as the mac cost on a drive (for the size I need)
05:56 +Branes: I set up an MBP17 for a friend recently and added a FW800 ExpressCard for his 1TB sample-drive. Uses it with Logic and Cubase and it's quite sprightly -- it leaves the internal drive for rendering, OS and usual stuff.
05:57  Kimbo1986_: yea hm sounds like a good idea
05:57 +Branes: It also frees up the onboard FW interface for his Fireface.
05:57  Kimbo1986_: right
05:58 +Branes: I've seen similarly-set-up rigs, some opt to use onboard FW for the audio interface and add an eSATA ExpressCard, others go the other way and use an FW800 ExpressCard for their audio interface and use the onboard FW for storage access.
05:59 +Branes: When you're messing with things like the EWQL orchestral libraries, it makes a huge difference :)
06:01  Kimbo1986_: haha yea
06:01  Kimbo1986_: There hasnt been a whole lot that I couldnt really do on here
06:02  Kimbo1986_: BUT, theres a  lot of instances where the CPU just cant handle it
06:02  Kimbo1986_: and I have to freeze several tracks to continue
06:02  FriedBob: Mornin'
06:02 +Branes: Effects are what's going to nail you the most.
06:02  Kimbo1986_: or bounce out everything and work on a single track at a time
06:02 +Branes: 'lo Bob
06:02  Kimbo1986_: yea
06:02  Kimbo1986_: plugins are a killer
06:02 +Branes: wb Vel
06:02  Kimbo1986_: I max my CPU on one vocal track if Im really diggin in
06:03  FriedBob: How goes tonight?
06:03 +Branes: heh, not difficult :)
06:03 * Branes has been enjoying a lazy, warm Sunday arvo :)

06:06  Kimbo1986_: Hey uhh.. 
06:06  Kimbo1986_: where can i access a "task manager" in mac osx
06:06  Kimbo1986_: lol
06:06  FriedBob: TO force quit?
06:06  Kimbo1986_: I just loaded this parallels and installed xp, want to make sure this is not running in the backround
06:07  Kimbo1986_: when i shut it down
06:07  FriedBob: top in console, or use the apple menu to bring up force quit. I can never remember the key combo for that.
06:07  FriedBob: Might be a few other ways as well, to see what is running
06:08 +Branes: In /Applications/Utilities/ fire up 'Activity Monitor'
06:08  FriedBob: Trust Branes to know the GUI way. ;)
06:08  Kimbo1986_: thanks
06:09 +Branes: There isn't any other way worth discussing ;)
06:09  FriedBob: Sure there is. top

07:51  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: yes and no
07:51  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: mac drivers allow passive scanning, but you wont be able to inject packets
07:51  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: using linux, you *might* be able to inject, depending on your wireless card
07:52  alexlea: atheros work, broadcom do not
07:52  alexlea: simple speak, you cant crack wep/wpa with a mac+osx, but maybe with a mac+linux, or a 3rd party usb wifi card+osx
07:55  q_a_z_steve: alexlea: Are there tools to make broadcom do it under *nix then?
07:56  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: no, the linux tools only work on the atheros
07:56  q_a_z_steve: thought so
07:56  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: the other day i went and bought a 19.99$ usb wifi device and it worked with kismac
07:57  q_a_z_steve: link!
07:57  q_a_z_steve: under osx?
07:57  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: yes...do you also want a link to kismac
07:57  q_a_z_steve: I can find that, and kismet, but which card for $20
07:58  alexlea: you dont need kismet, you nee aircrack for wordlist wpa attacks
07:58  alexlea: well, maybe kismet does it, i got aircrack form macports tho
07:58  q_a_z_steve: www.newegg.com or amazon?
07:59  q_a_z_steve: Find me a link toi buy the same card?

07:59  alexlea: thats where i bought mine
08:00  alexlea: i biught it in real life at the store
08:00  q_a_z_steve: you paid only $20 at fry's, that's a steal
08:00  q_a_z_steve: fry's > I usually spend
08:01  alexlea: it comes in 4 version, i ended up with version 3 which def works.... online doesnt advertise what version any of hem are because they are all the same model...i think 1,2, 3 work but 4 doesnt
08:01  q_a_z_steve: kismac <> kismet on mac?
08:02  q_a_z_steve: alexlea: familiar with that concept for 3rd party firmware linksys routers… :( Thanks for the info!
08:02  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: for wpa, you dont have to be able to inject, you just have to monitor and capture a handshale, and from personal expereince, i have never cracked wpa 
08:02  alexlea: the wordlists are too limited...they cant have EVERY possible combination, so its a matter of getting lucky
08:03  q_a_z_steve: have to steal about 1GB of packets is it?
08:03  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: for what? for wep, you can usually crack it in minutes
08:03  alexlea: for wpa, you just have to hope they have a WEAK password
08:03  q_a_z_steve: nice
08:03  alexlea: you dont actually capture info, you do bruteforce
08:04  q_a_z_steve: hmm, good to know. I think that's inherent with the technology — "MIC" or something?
08:05  alexlea: not sure what MIC is; all i know is that wpa uses either PSK or some other thing, only PSK is even possible (and pretty much all consumer routers use psk)
08:05  q_a_z_steve: can mac drivers handle LEAP/PEAP?

08:06  q_a_z_steve: or any of those enterprise methods (i.e. I think these are the one's requiring a username on the other end...)
08:06  alexlea: and so you capture a handshake, and then use aircrack and run wordlist attacks...it runs through millions of words...and basically its a matter of luck
08:06  alexlea: you dont have to be online to do it once you capture the handshake
08:08  alexlea: q_a_z_steve: i think so, i think mac drivers can handle leap..cause th mac card+kismac can monitor networks, and you dont have to inject to capture a handshake
08:08  alexlea: i am nit sure tho
08:08  alexlea: wep cracking i understand completely...wpa i have just recently attempted
08:08  alexlea: but i have been doing wep for years
08:08  q_a_z_steve: kk
08:09  alexlea: you might wanna read/google rainbow tables as well
08:09  alexlea: i dont fully understand the concept, just heard about it 2 days ago
08:13  alexbobP: so mac os has this feature where when I tell my computer to shut down, a program can prevent that from happening
08:13  alexlea: http://www.renderlab.net/projects/WPA-tables/
08:13  alexbobP: who thought that was a good idea?
08:14  alexlea: alexbobP: in termanl, typing sudo shutdown trumps all that
08:14  alexlea: well, sudo reboot does, i assume sudo shutdown does as well
08:14  alexbobP: alexlea: ah, okay
08:14  alexbobP: so it's just the gui that screws me...
08:15  alexbobP: good to know, thanks
08:15  alexlea: yeah, just hte gui...i have always found it annoying
08:16  alexlea: afk
08:24  neekers: i am trying to connect to a network share with my macbook, if i do htpp://192.168.1.1/shares, it works in the browser, but when i try to "connect to server" with cifs://readyshare or cifs://192.168.1.1/shares it fails with "Connection failed"
08:26  neekers: the server readyshare may not exist or is unavailable at this time when i try cifs://readyshare, why is it available in the browser?
08:29 +Branes: try smb:// instead
08:29  neekers: yes, i tried that also
08:30  neekers: they actually both bring up a dialog asking me for my user name and password, its'
08:31  neekers: after i enter that, that i get the error message
08:34  neekers: why does this have to be so damn difficult?
08:34 +Branes: Probably because Apple expect you to buy a Time Capsule, or at the very least an Airport Extreme Base Station.
08:35 +Tomis: port scan the machine
08:35 +Tomis: find out what ports are open
08:35 +Tomis: then determine what protocol those relate to
08:43  neekers: Tomis: here is the result of nmap: http://pastebin.com/2D5aCuDC
08:44 +Tomis: um.. it's blank?
08:44  neekers: how bizarre
08:44  alexlea: oops
08:45  neekers: Tomis: http://pastebin.com/r2cgfwLc
08:46  neekers: no idea why the last one went blank
08:46 +Tomis: so in other words, none of that is file sharing
08:46 +Tomis: what's microsoft-ds
08:46  neekers: not sure, let me look
08:46 +Tomis: SMB over TCP apparently
08:48  neekers: and netbios-sn on port 139 is windows file sharing
08:52  neekers: it worked, i tried smb://192.168.1.1 without the share name and it connected...
08:52  neekers: cool, thanks you guys for helping me with that
08:57  neekers: ok, now to figure out how to connect time machine to that network drive... :/
08:57 +Branes: Don't bother.
08:57  neekers: i cant see the drive in time machine
08:57  neekers: how come?
08:58 +Branes: Time Machine only works with a physically-connected drive, a Time Capsule, or another Mac with file-sharing enabled. It uses a custom dual-ended protocol.
08:58  neekers: heh
08:59 +Branes: There is a defaultswrite hack to make Time Machine see any drive, but because of the way TM stores the data, any backup archive becomes corrupt in short order.
08:59  neekers: how much time and money have i spent trying to back up my macbook...
09:00  neekers: and be able to move large files from my windows box
09:00 +Branes: If you want to backup to a non-standard device, pay the shareware fee for SuperDuper! as it can do most of what Time Machine does but without the proprietry headaches, and will store its backup on *anything*.
09:01  neekers: will it also let you take a snapshot of the system and restore the entire system from a boot disk/network share?
09:01 +Branes: no
09:01 +Branes: You can only do that with an Apple-provided solution.
09:02 +Branes: The cheapest is Mini Server.
09:02  neekers: should i have just bought that expensive apple wireless network hard drive thingy?
09:03 +Branes: If you avoid network, you can clone an internal drive to a USB or FireWire external with SuperDuper, CarbonCopyCloner, or the backup/restore functions inside Disk Utility.
09:03 +Branes: Time Capsule is not capable of doing the snapshot/netboot trick, only OSX Server can do that for you.
09:03  neekers: ahh
09:04 +Branes: Yet another standard that has had a 'little' Apple change that renders it useless for anything but their products.
09:04  neekers: well, by biggest concern really is just backing up my dev files off of my mbp, that is my top priority
09:05 +Branes: Small cheap USB drive and CarbonCopyCloner, then?
09:05  neekers: so superduper is the waqy to go?
09:05 +Branes: Depends on what kinds of backup systems you're looking for. It's the closest you'll get to TM without using TM.
09:05  neekers: well, i had the usb drive connected directly to the mbp but having all these wires hanging off the thing was a pain
09:05 +Branes: Otherwise, CCC is free, but manual.
09:06  neekers: that time capsule looks nice, but at $278... Le ouch...
09:07 +Branes: It's got a cut-down Mac inside, that's why. And a wireless router.
09:08 +Branes: The Time Capsule runs a subset of OSX, in much the same way the iPhone and AppleTV do.
09:09  neekers: i've turned into a mac junkie after coding on windows for 12 years... :)
09:09 --- Kasm279|Away is now known as Kasm279
09:39  neekers: ok, superduper it is, thanks branes
09:44  alexlea: i like ccc better
09:47  Kasm279: Branes: could the time capsule be hacked to run full OSX like the original Appl eTV?
09:48  richardcavell: Time Capsule isn't running a whole Mac inside it
09:49 +Branes: no
09:49  Kasm279: richardcavell: thats what i thought
09:49  richardcavell: Apple TV is
09:50  Kasm279: What may be surprising is that the Time Capsule is no more than an Airport Extreme with a hard drive.
09:50  Kasm279: http://www.tuaw.com/2008/03/01/time-capsule-teardown/
09:54  Kasm279: yeah
09:54  Kasm279: branes
09:55  Kasm279: pretty sure OSX can run on a marvelkl SoC
09:57 +Tomis: lol Kasm279 
09:57 +Tomis: yea it's totally x86
09:57  Kasm279: next Branes will try to tell us that the original airport ran OS9
09:58 +Tomis: huh?
09:58  Kasm279: or that the Stylewriter or something ran System 7
09:58 +Tomis: oh i see, after scrolling back
09:58 +Tomis: yea that doesn't make sense Branes 
09:59  alexlea: quit making fun of Branes....that's my job :P
09:59 +Tomis: it's just some crappy embeded OS with services to match apple's spec
09:59  Kasm279: running even a variant of a desktop OS on anything other than a system being actually used directly by a user is incredibly stupid
10:00  Kasm279: i also doubt OSX would be on anything with a dedicated gigabit ethernet switch chip on it
10:00 +Branes: Why not? All the TC needs is about half of the OSX kernel, and a little bit of extra grafted on so it can be managed from a normal machine.
10:00 +Branes: And the original Airport UFOs ran a BSD variant, IIRC
10:00 +Tomis: or a lightweight embeded OS like they've been using for years
10:01  Kasm279: Branes: i can believe BSD on a router
10:01  Kasm279: also
10:01  Kasm279: darwin/mach kernel != OSX
10:02 +Branes: It's still considered a variant, as is iOS
10:02  Kasm279: by who else, Branes?
10:02 +Tomis: well yea
10:02  Kasm279: and iOS is because its actually got more than just the kernel
10:02 +Tomis: but i can't see them puttign darwin in a router
10:02  Kasm279: same
10:03 +Tomis: either way, their routers are crap IMO
10:03  Kasm279: ^
10:03  Kasm279: netgear wpn824v2 ftw
10:03 +Branes: no argument on that point :)
10:03 +Tomis: needing to reboot for every minor setting change, needing custom apps to make those changes
10:03  Kasm279: night
10:03 +Tomis: complete fail
10:03 --- Kasm279 is now known as Kasm279|Away
10:36  q_a_z_steve: hey, how do I tell whether my macbook pro has a 64 bit processor? I'm getting mixed signals from Activity Monitor.
10:37  [M]ax: q_a_z_steve what processor have you got?
10:37  q_a_z_steve: 2.66 Core 2 Duo - so I wouldn't think it would be 64bit, right?
10:38  [M]ax: hold
10:38  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: core 2 duo is 64 bit
10:38  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: only the first generation or so intel macs were 32 bit, core duo.
10:38  [M]ax: 64bit
10:39  [M]ax: http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?spec=slapb
10:39  q_a_z_steve: EdLin:  [M]ax Where would I see it for sure? Am I blind so as to not see it in System Profiler?
10:39  [M]ax: q_a_z_steve check that url i provided you with
10:39  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: you can be sure that if it's 2.66ghz, it's a core2duo mac and therefore 64 bit.
10:40  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: core2duo, i3, i5, i7, Xeon, all 64 bit macs.
10:40  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: coreduo, 32 bit macs. no longer made.
10:41  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: keep in mind that unless you're running the recently extinct xserves, Apple made OS X boot with a 32 bit kernel whether your system supports 64 bit or not by default.
10:42  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: but that doesn't mean you can't run 64 bit apps.
10:42  q_a_z_steve: kewl. I will keep that in mind for future downloads.
10:42  [M]ax: q_a_z_steve if in doubt check the intel site
10:43  q_a_z_steve: k
10:45  q_a_z_steve: I think the only item I have not downloaded 64 bit when there could have been a chance would be openoffice
10:45  q_a_z_steve: Although I don't see a 64bit download. There may not be one...
10:46  q_a_z_steve: I am confused for the third time by their phrasing "Start downloading OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 for Mac OS Intel in English (US)
10:46  q_a_z_steve: (Java Runtime Environment (JRE) included for all OS versions except Linux 32/64-bit Debian and Mac OS)".
10:47  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: they don't include a JRE for OS X because, until recently, Apple was the primary supplier of Java for OS X.
10:48  q_a_z_steve: hmm, that's interesting. Good to know.
10:48  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: of course, that stopped a few weeks ago, but nobody has stepped in yet as a new supplier of Java.
10:48  q_a_z_steve: wouldn't it default to Sun?
10:48  q_a_z_steve: Or am I not understanding "supplier"?
10:48  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: sun did not make Java for Apple, as Apple insisted on having control of Java.
10:49  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: Sun no longer exists as you know, they were eaten by Oracle.
10:49  q_a_z_steve: Ah, like the Adobe fight.
10:49  q_a_z_steve: tru nuf
10:49  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: yep, Apple is going to stop making Java for OS X, just as they have already for flash. It's Steve Jobs' war against plugins.
10:50  q_a_z_steve: Meh, could be worse, e.g. Linus war against bloat.
10:50  q_a_z_steve: s/Linus/Linus'
10:50  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: don't make me laugh, Linux is the most bloated Unix kernel out there.
10:51  q_a_z_steve: I agree it's getting out of hand. Linus' statement makes me sad in that it HAD to come from him for anyone to start listening.
10:51  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: I mean, you can't beat it as far as PC compatibility goes, but as far as bloat goes it's in a sorry state compared to BSD or even Solaris.
10:52  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: I stopped following what the Linux community was saying or doing since I got a Mac and a life. ;-)
10:53  q_a_z_steve: I agree kernel != drivers != modules. So they should never have pumped as much lard in there as is.
10:54 * q_a_z_steve thinks this "life" you mention is only available in folklore.
10:54  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: I mean, I do run a Linux kernel on several devices and my phone (which is an HD2 that runs Android off of the sd card :) ) but I think that "worse is better" is the principle that definitely applies to Linux.
10:55  q_a_z_steve: explain worse is better, you mean as far as kernel? I agree bloat doesn't float.

11:06  EdLin: q_a_z_steve: if I pay for a month of netflix, and have no internet for a week or so, I miss out on a week's worth of what I paid for.

11:09  q_a_z_steve: Xfinity or FIOS should be able to cover that I should think, are you with either of those?
11:09  EdLin: I'm with Optimum Online, there is no FIOS in NYC.

12:26  Bones: oops wrong channel
12:27  Bones: whew, everybody's asleep …
12:27 +Tomis: I SAW IT!!!!
12:27 +Tomis: won't tell anyone
12:27  Bones: saw what :p
12:27  q_a_z_steve: hmm
12:27  Bones: cool :nod:
12:52  ovrflw0x: what are other mac servers i can go to?
12:52  ovrflw0x: irc servers
12:52  ovrflw0x: i tried irc.osx86.net or org?
12:53  ovrflw0x: nvm
12:56  eroomde: greetings - can an imac run an OS headlessly while being used as an external monitor? We're plotting an upgrade path for our little research group and are considering getting a new imac and we like to set up its guts as a file server in, say, five years, while keeping it for use as a monitor
12:57  richardcavell: gee I don't think so
12:57  richardcavell: not without pulling out a screwdriver
13:01  eroomde: ok thanks. so when used as an external monitor, does the imac itself have to be booted up? is it a firmware feature or an OS feature?
13:10  richardcavell: Dunno man
13:10  richardcavell: Wait for Branes to be online.  He'll know.
13:18  Angostura: eroomde: You talking about the 27" iMac?
13:18  eroomde: Angostura: yes
13:21  eroomde: essentially we're torn between 27" imac or an equivalent wadge of cash on a dell 27" IPS display and whatever money is left over for a tower. We'd favour the imac (as long as it runs something posix compient we're happy) but it'd be nice to know that the computer part of it won't just be dead weight in five years
13:21  Angostura: eroomde: Just having a google around since it is an interesting question
13:22  Angostura: eroomde: Here you go: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924
13:23  Angostura: The most important point is the first one: "Applications running on the 27-inch iMac computer remain open and running while it is in Target Display mode."
13:23  Angostura: But... "you cannot access its built-in iSight or USB and FireWire ports."
13:25  Angostura: So assuming you don't want USB/Firewire it sounds as if the 27" will work fine as a headless server
13:25  Angostura: The main thing is to ensure that you have the correct video cables.
13:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: what's the state of package management systems for OSX these days, and which one is decent?
13:36  Angostura: KeeperOfTheSoul: I take it you're not talking about standard OS X apps?
13:40  Bones: macworld had a feature on the best apps this year
13:40  Bones: one of them seemed to be a package management one
13:41  swaksi: Hey, I got one question. When I write "uptime" in the console. It says bla bla 2 users, load average bla bla
13:41  swaksi: the number of users, what does it mean?
13:41  swaksi: I'm the only user on the mac
13:41 +Tomis: the system counts as another user
13:41 +Tomis: ie, "root"
13:41  Bones: called Sparkle
13:42  swaksi: okey
13:42  swaksi: thanks for clearing up that
13:42 +Tomis: look in activity monitor swaksi 
13:42 +Tomis: you'll see the user column
13:42 * Bones is viewing "Sparkle: a free software update framework for the Mac" at http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/
13:42  swaksi: in the user column the only user is my account
13:43 +Tomis: sparkle is a version check/self-update/self-instal system Bones 
13:43  Bones: yeah i just noticed that
13:43 +Tomis: show: all users swaksi 
13:43  Bones: just noticed it when installing an update for EyeTV
13:43  Angostura: Odd, my uptime current shows three users.Activity monitor shows 11 distinct users
13:44 +Tomis: uptime shows 2 for me, and several users for the processes
13:44  swaksi: tomsi: where do I find that option?
13:44 +Tomis: in the toolbar of the window swaksi 
13:44 +Tomis: the default is "my processes"
13:45  swaksi: a-ha
13:45  swaksi: thanks
13:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: Angostura: nope, things like irssi
13:49  KeeperOfTheSoul: well, irssi, git, ruby, etc
13:51  q_a_z_steve: KeeperOfTheSoul don't lie for me. Angostura I was in your computer, it will time out soon.
13:51  q_a_z_steve: d-_-b
14:06  eroomde: Angostura: sorry for the delay, I got called away for lunch (other half has a thing about observing sunday munches)
14:06  eroomde: thank you for your research on my behalf
14:07  eroomde: that's a good thing to hear. I assume the monitor pass-through is done at a lower level than the OS, so I could conceivably install another operating system onboard (our file and print server is debain atm and we like it) and still have it work

14:51  FriedBob: EdLin: Oi oi!
14:51  EdLin: FriedBob: what?
14:51  FriedBob: EdLin: Just saying hi
14:51  EdLin: hi
14:52  EdLin: FriedBob: I got xbox gold back again, just for a month for now before I move.
14:52  FriedBob: EdLin: Cool. Gonna be on any today?
14:52  EdLin: maybe...
14:53  FriedBob: Holla at me if so, this is one of my few days off.
14:53  EdLin: ok
14:53  EdLin: it's a little early right now to be gaming, maybe later today.
14:55  FriedBob: It's never too early, or too late, to game. But yeah, got some other stuff I am working on right now anyways. :)
14:55  EdLin: ok
14:56  EdLin: I have to warn you, my eye-hand coordination is awful.
14:56  FriedBob: Mine isn't that great.
14:56  FriedBob: I do OK among casual gamers, but can't / won't compete with those professional ones.
14:57  EdLin: yeah, I'm definitely casual, emphasis on the casual. ;-)
14:57  EdLin: I find myself using the xbox more as a media box than anything else lately.
14:57  dcorbin: I'm using Numbers.  When I copy and paste a bunch of cells, it is copying content and fill, but not cell borders.  Any ideas on how to get it copy the borders too?
14:58  EdLin: dcorbin: my sympathies, Numbers is the worst part of iWork.
14:58 @ChrisAM: I don't have much experience with Numbers... I use Excel all day long.
14:59  EdLin: Keynote and the Word Processor of iWork are good, but Numbers is sub-standard. It's almost like Steve Jobs doesn't *want* his computers to be used by people who aren't liberal arts types. ;-)

15:20  iaj: EdLin: what do you use instead of numbers?
15:21  iaj: and I got a question is there any way when I'm on Preview.app on a certain file, to hand over that same file to Photoshop?
15:21  EdLin: iaj: I'd recommend MS Excel for a spreadsheet.
15:21 +Tomis: drag the icon in the files' titlebar iaj
15:21 +Tomis: drop it into photoshop
15:23  iaj: Tomis: i ment with just the menus or stuff - I don't want to use the mouse :\
15:23 +Tomis: no, there's no shortcut for that
15:24  eroomde: well/wc
15:25  iaj: Tomis: drag that file- from finder?
15:26 +Tomis: you could do that too
15:26 +Tomis: notice the titlebar for the file has an icon
15:26 +Tomis: that icon is actually a link to the file on disk, you can drag that icon to an application to open the file in that app
15:27  iaj: Ohhh.. that's nice - I didn't know about that - does that work on any app?
15:27 +Tomis: yes
15:28  FriedBob: That is good to know.
15:28 +Tomis: you can also right-click it to get a menu showing you the path to the file, click on any item in that menu and it will locate that part of the path in the finder
15:29  joakimk: I'm trying to install Synergy (for sharing a mouse/keyboard between Ubuntu and osx 10.6). Seems I have to download the source, and compile it myself on the mac... ./configure runs fine, but make ends with an error: http://www.pastebin.com/jprrYtxH
15:29  joakimk: ^ see line 7...
15:31  FriedBob: joakimk: So, you have an Intel mac running 10.4 that you are trying to build this on?
15:32  joakimk: FriedBob: it's a MacBook, with Intel and 10.6 actually
15:33  freedevil: did anyones mobileme account become inactive on the iphone with 4.2.1 on a restore that is?
15:34  joakimk: FriedBob: what does the error tell me, actually? Do you understand it? :)
15:35  FriedBob: joakimk: Try this. Make clean, then re run the configure script
15:35  Angostura: joakimk: Sounds like either a PPC/Intel clash or a 32bit/64bit clash
15:35  Angostura: (based on my zero knowledge)
15:36  FriedBob: I had no problems compiling the program - but I am on a PPC mac running 10.4
15:36  joakimk: FriedBob: OK... configure ends well.
15:36  joakimk: FriedBob: then make again?
15:36  FriedBob: Can you pastebin the full output of that - AFTER doing a full clean ( make clean, or make mrproper)?
15:39  joakimk: FriedBob: sure :) So I did make clean and configure, and here's the output of make: http://www.pastebin.com/HvV0MMBW
15:40  FriedBob: I wanted the output of configure. The make is showing the same stuff
15:40  FriedBob: Also include what, if any, flags you passed to configure
15:41  joakimk: output of configure! Here it is: http://www.pastebin.com/cZZsUzE3
15:45  joakimk: FriedBob: I also found websites suggesting installing Synergy by using Darwin Ports... what do you think is better?
15:47  joakimk: Angostura: yeah... do you think this is simply incompatible code?
15:47  FriedBob: joakimk: You can try it. Have you read the readme / install file?
15:47  Angostura: Well actually. Was 10.4 the first Intel version of the OS?
15:48  Angostura: IN which case the error would seem simple on the face of it
15:48  FriedBob: http://www.pastebin.com/cZZsUzE3
15:48  FriedBob: Oops
15:48  quiesce: Yes, but not at launch.
15:48  joakimk: FriedBob: yes, for Synergy. It's quite brief, only says "configure, make, sudo make install"
15:48 +Tomis: yea 10.4 was the first mac os x to be released for intel
15:49  joakimk: Angostura: How do you mean?
15:49  Angostura: It's saying - you're trying to simulteneously target an OS version earlier that 10.4 and Intel at the same time
15:49  FriedBob: joakimk: code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/detail?id=324
15:49  FriedBob: It's a known issue
15:50  joakimk: FriedBob:  :) So should I get some patch? Not very familiar with these types of problems
15:50  FriedBob: joakimk: Read the info on that page
15:52  joakimk: FriedBob: yes, I am... "This patch should allow compilation on 10.6. It forces 32-bit compilation" <-- sounds like the thing then?
15:52  FriedBob: Probably. Several people said that compiling 32bit fixed the issue
15:53  joakimk: FriedBob: yeah... But, what do I do with such a patch file? 
15:54  FriedBob: Is it a .diff?
15:54  joakimk: Well, there's 0001-fix-compilation-on-10.6.patch  and later someone suggests cmakelists_config_diff.patch 
15:55  joakimk: FriedBob: I have a directory with the source code etc, downloaded from sourceforge.
15:55  FriedBob: You probably have to use diff, but it's been way too long since I have had to do this.
15:56  FriedBob: You might want to see if you can find a pre-patched version. You mentioned darwin ports earlier, do you already have that environment setup?
15:56  joakimk: FriedBob: they are referring to SVN; maybe I should/could just get the head version?
15:57  joakimk: FriedBob: well, that's another thing I couldn't get working.. :(
15:57 @ChrisAM: man patch
15:58  joakimk: ChrisAM: But wouldn't you say I'd have to make sure I have the "right source" first? As in, I need to check out the code from the SVN they're talking about?
15:58  joakimk: ChrisAM: the code I have is from sourceforge, and this wiki (w/ patches) is on google code
15:58 @ChrisAM: ah
15:58 @ChrisAM: get that then
15:59  FriedBob: The project was hosted on Google Code, then moved to SF
15:59  FriedBob: But yeah, make sure you have the most recent code base
15:59  joakimk: FriedBob: yes, I saw the post at the bottom there. So I'll download the new source code from synergy-foss.org 
15:59  joakimk: FriedBob: Maybe it'll compile this time? :)
16:00  joakimk: FriedBob: I guess getting the Mac OS X 10.5 dmg file is no point?
16:00  FriedBob: No idea.
16:00  FriedBob: But probably not.
16:01  FriedBob: I think there were significant changes 10.5 -> 10.6
16:01  FriedBob: But as I said, I am on a PPC mac running 10.4
16:03 @ChrisAM: I would have given up by now and just bought a kvm switch.
16:03  joakimk: hehe
16:03  FriedBob: I have 2 of those.
16:04  FriedBob: But still use synergy for sharing between my mactop and primary desktop
16:04  FriedBob: I have a 2 port I use for sharing between my two desktops. And a 4 port I don't currently use since I got the 2 port.
16:04  FriedBob: I wonder if I can daisychain them though...
16:08 @ChrisAM: as long as the keyboard control codes are different, it shouldn't be a problem.
16:09  FriedBob: I'd have to get more things setup before I did that. And likely would prefer to keep them separate, so I can use 2 at a time
16:09  joakimk: thanks for the help, I'll try to apply the patch :)
16:09 @ChrisAM: I don't have the problem of having more than 1 computer at my desk at home... heh.
16:10  FriedBob: I can't stand to work w/ only a single monitor and/or a single machine at once.
16:10  FriedBob: I'm spoiled
16:10 @ChrisAM: I've got 3 monitors on my desk at work, but at home, all I use is my 13" MacBook.
16:11 @ChrisAM: But I think after christmas, I'll get a 15" MBP.
16:12 @ChrisAM: heh... the skiddies brought down Mastercard again.
16:15 +Tomis: when's obama going to save us by turning off the internet? won't someone please think of the corporations that are under attack?!
16:16 @ChrisAM: once the skiddies attack something important, maybe we'll worry
16:16 @ChrisAM: bringing down the front page of mastercard does nothing.
16:16 +Tomis: they should crash the TSA
16:16 +Tomis: that'd really be useful
16:17 +Tomis: crash all those backscatter machines 
16:17 @ChrisAM: yeah... force everyone to get Freedom Pats... great idea.
16:18  FriedBob: I don't have to fly, but I think if I did, I'd go for the pat down, then call the cops and file a complaint of molestation.
16:18 @ChrisAM: I wouldn't mind the backscatter thing if we got something in return... let me keep my shoes on, let me keep my belt on... let me keep my laptop in the bag.
16:19 @ChrisAM: those 3 things really slow everyone down at the airport.
16:19 +Tomis: if everyone ops for the patdown, you know what happens? they open the old metal detectors and run everyone through just like they used to do for *years*
16:19 +Tomis: problem solved
16:19 @ChrisAM: If someone in a back room is seeing my nekkid body, I don't really care. I don't like being touched though.
16:19  FriedBob: My wife thinks the best thing to do is, if you don't like the process, then don't fly.
16:20 @ChrisAM: I've flown recently... I went through the regular metal detectors with no pat down.
16:20 +Tomis: the best thing to do if you don't like the continued erosion of privacy, is to fly and refuse the backscatter and let them know how you feel about it
16:20  FriedBob: I don't think all the airports have the new ones yet, just the biggest one
16:20 @ChrisAM: They had one.
16:21 @ChrisAM: It's hit or miss whether I go through it.
16:21 +Tomis: yea, hopefully as people wake up they'll remove the things
16:21 +Tomis: it's all just a money grab by the companies making them
16:21 @ChrisAM: Flying back from DCA, I went through the machine.
16:21 +Tomis: nothing more
16:21 @ChrisAM: of course it is.
16:21  FriedBob: They don't add any real security.
16:21  FriedBob: Then again, neither did taking your shoes off.
16:21 @ChrisAM: There is no apparent increase in security, and no improvement to the traveler's experience.
16:22 +Tomis: that's true with most security though really
16:22 @ChrisAM: If going through the backscatter machine means making the security line 25% faster, I'm all for it.
16:22 @ChrisAM: but it adds no value.
16:22  FriedBob: I like the airport security idea presented in one of the Saints Row 2 commercials.
16:22 +Tomis: they shouldn't even be using a machine which gives you a stripsearch
16:22  FriedBob: Arm everyone.
16:23 +Tomis: the metal detectors worked fine, and better to boot
16:23 +Tomis: yea so we have a bunch of crazy rednecks firing randomly into a crowd when they see a brown man
16:23 +Tomis: good idea
16:23  FriedBob: Aren't the patdowns more invasive than what the cops are allowed to do w/o a warrant or STRONG probable cause?
16:23 +Tomis: yes
16:24 +Tomis: they're designed that way to try and force you to go through the digitalstrip search
16:25  FriedBob: I wonder how many people "accidently" let one rip during them? I think I would.
16:25 +Tomis: of course isn't it a bi silly we're spending all this money on airports when any potential terrorist could just drive down a busy street and blow their car up
16:25 +Tomis: yet that doesn't happen
16:25  FriedBob: Not here at least.
16:25 +Tomis: it's a solution to a problem we don't have
16:26  FriedBob: Or stuff like that guy that got onto a greyhound, carved up a few people and cut off at least one head. But you don't see metal detectors at the bus stations
16:26 +Tomis: of course, because the expense outweighs the problem
16:26 @ChrisAM: FriedBob ... the TSA has mobile units now that they're brining to greyhound stations.
16:27 +Tomis: are they?
16:27 @ChrisAM: yup
16:27 +Tomis: or have they only threatened to do so if people don't shut up and comply
16:27 @ChrisAM: Mass Transit: WE WILL END YOU!
16:27  FriedBob: BRB, need to walk my dog

17:15  marrrk: Hi! My mac seems quite slow to me. I identified some processes whose purposes are unclear to me. Is there a way to speed it up again?
17:23  marrrk: Okay then another question. If I reinstall Snow Leopard, will I be able to keep my Bootcamp partition?
17:26 @crilly: bashusr, zer0her0 !
17:26 @crilly: marrrk: Yes, you should be able too. When you install, you select the OS X (HFS) partition to install too.
17:27  marrrk: Sounds good.
17:27 +Tomis: how have oyu determiend hat these processes are slowing down the system marrrk 
17:27  marrrk: I haven't.
17:28 +Tomis: then why worry about those
17:28  marrrk: Because, maybe they do.
17:28 +Tomis: how much ram do you have, what's your swap size, free ram
17:28  marrrk: And if I don't need them I might as well not let them run.
17:28 +Tomis: look in the memory tab in activity monitor
17:28  marrrk: I have only 4GB
17:29 +Tomis: there are a number of background processes which run as part of the system
17:29  marrrk: Free 530. Reserved 577
17:29  marrrk: Yes, but I checked against the process list of a friend.
17:29 +Tomis: and swap used?
17:29  marrrk: 18,6 MB
17:29  marrrk: It gets worse when I run Parallels, it does.
17:30 +Tomis: ok sound you're low on ram
17:30 +Tomis: that's all
17:30  marrrk: Why? Is 18MB swap that bad?
17:30 +Tomis: anything over 0 means you've swapped at some point
17:31  marrrk: Why does it use swap if there is memory left?
17:31 +Tomis: there wasn't, so it swapped
17:32 +Tomis: now you have free memory again
17:32  marrrk: Why doesn't it put it back into memory then?
17:32 @crilly: Using Parallels likely forced the OS into using swap spacw
17:32 +Tomis: it does when it's needed
17:32  marrrk: oh yeah, sounds logical
17:32 +Tomis: that's the whole point of swap, you ran out of physical memory, and it had to swap to/from disk
17:32 +Tomis: hence the slow down
17:32 @crilly: Virtualisation is a RAM hog :)
17:33  marrrk: they should ship new macbook pros with a reasonable amount of ram anyway and not charge a million for 8GB
17:33 +Tomis: you could try turning down the RAM size of your VM, or running less ram hungry processes at the same time
17:33 +Tomis: 4GB is reasonable
17:33 +Tomis: go to newegg.com get yourself a 2x4GB kit
17:34  marrrk: that's what I'll do (well not at newegg.com)
17:34 +Tomis: where do you get ram?
17:34  marrrk: I'm from Germany
17:34 +Tomis: ah
17:34 +Tomis: well yea, not from newegg then, heh
17:35 +Tomis: yea apple's prices on ram/hd upgrades are stupid
17:35  marrrk: I'm just a little sad cause I considered getting the 8GB instead of 4
17:35 +Tomis: no biggie
17:35 +Tomis: i'd recommend upping it yourself anyway
17:35  marrrk: And now I'll have a useless 4GB
17:35 +Tomis: save a litle money
17:35  marrrk: Yes, you see I would have preferred to pay less and have it delivered with no ram at all.
17:35 +Tomis: lol
17:36 +Tomis: which invariably would actually coast more, since it would be BTO
17:36  marrrk: But maybe it swapped because I have a memory leak in what I'm programming, so I'm not sure if that's really the problem
17:36  marrrk: is that "configured"?
17:36 +Tomis: it probably swapped while you were running the VM and had a web browser open with a million tabs or something
17:37 +Tomis: BTO = built-to order
17:37 +Tomis: ie, a custom config, not one of the stock configs
17:37  marrrk: I can't recall running the VM.
17:37  marrrk: Yeah it was custom config anyway :P
17:37 +Tomis: look on the bright side, once you up the RAM, you can sell he previus ram, and call it a discount, heh
17:38  marrrk: I just know myself too well, to know I won't sell it.
17:39  marrrk: Is there a way I can tell what the SWAP is being used for?
17:39 +Tomis: not that i know of
17:39 +Tomis: it's pretty simple though
17:40 +Tomis: when ram gets low, it looks at what ram is inactive, what hasn't been touched in a while, it swaps that out first
17:40  marrrk: You think with 8GB Parallels will be alright?
17:40 +Tomis: what machine is this?
17:40  marrrk: MBP 2010 15" Core i7
17:41 +Tomis: yea, that can only go up to 8GB anyway
17:41  marrrk: yeah I know
17:41  marrrk: thanks I'll get that for christmas
17:41 +Tomis: at least until 8GB laptop chips some out and someone tests it to see if it can go further
17:41 +Tomis: *come out
17:51 @crilly: Tomis: I don't think the firmware will register anything above 8GB?
17:55 +Tomis: we won't know until 8GB laptop chips come out and people start testing it
17:56 +Tomis: it wouldn't surprise me if apple implemented an arbitrary cap even if the underlying chipset is fully capable of supporting more than was available at the time of shipping
17:57  FriedBob: Wait, a computer maker putting arbitrary limits in place? Unheard of!

19:05  mrapple: Hi
19:05  tonsofpcs: hi
19:06  LordDragon: hi ixixi 
19:09  shuaib: So I had repartitioned my HD into to different partitions, and now Bootcamp complains saying it can only use an unpartitioned drive in order to make a new one for Windows... any solution to this situation guys?
19:11 @crilly: Hmm
19:11 +Tomis: that's the bootcamp assistant
19:11  shuaib: Tomis: yes
19:11 +Tomis: it's only purpose is to partition the drive for installing windows
19:11 @crilly: I guess you could delete the partition you wnated to install too, then run Bootcamp again.
19:11 @crilly: Tomis: And drivers?
19:11 +Tomis: drivers are on the system DVD
19:12 +Tomis: i'd ignore it and just go to installing windows
19:12  shuaib: crilly: I had the other partition for different purpose. Now would like to create a third for Windows
19:12 @crilly: Tomis: I don't remember Bootcamp asking me to insert my OS X DVD/CDs to get Windows drivers for supporting the chipset?
19:13  shuaib: Bootcamp assistant and Bootcamp are two different things?
19:13 +Tomis: yes
19:13  shuaib: Aah
19:13  shuaib: I don't seem to find bootcamp on my system then...
19:13 +Tomis: bootcamp is the general term for the collection of pieces allowing you to easily setup and instal windows
19:13  shuaib: Can assistant be there without bootcamp itself?
19:13  shuaib: I see
19:13 +Tomis: there is no bootcamp app
19:14 +Tomis: there's bootcamp assistant for doing the partitioning, and it tells you to then go instal windows and then pop in the system DVD to instal the "bootcamp drivers" in windows
19:14  shuaib: So can I just use Disk Utility to create an NTFS partition, and continue with that?
19:15 +Tomis: to create a FAT32 partition that you'll then wipe from the windows side for instal, yes
19:16  shuaib: Ok, so I guess, here is how I should go about the process: 1- Create FAT32 using DU, 2- Install Windows on it 3- Install bootcamp drivers?
19:17 +Tomis: yea
19:17  shuaib: Ok, thanks Tomis 
19:17 +Tomis: or delete the second partition, scale the existing mac partition up to fill in the space, and run bootcamp assistant
19:17 +Tomis: it's all the same really
19:18 @crilly: Why FAT32?
19:18 @crilly: Windows 7 is NTFS isn't it?
19:18 +Tomis: because windows will see it crilly 
19:18 @crilly: It should see an NTFS partition too.
19:18  shuaib: Btw, I am not a Windows fan... just want to play some games just to get a feel of hardware of my mbp :P
19:18 +Tomis: mac can't format as NTFS
19:19 +Tomis: NTFS is read-only under mac os x, apple can't be bothered to finish the NTF driver i guess
19:19  LordDragon: Tomis, mine can :) with ntfs-3g
19:19 @crilly: Indeed LordDragon 
19:19 +Tomis: yup, you need 3rd party drivers for write support
19:24 @crilly: Tomis: Which I agree isn't.. WRITE! Get it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
19:25 +Tomis: would be nice if they'd all cross-license each other's disk formats

22:37 +Tomis: rig the market, get a bunch of people to make her worse offers
22:37 +Tomis: then come back in a month and try again
