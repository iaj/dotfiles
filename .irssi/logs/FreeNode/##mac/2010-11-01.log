00:09  Branes: http://gigaom.com/video/microsoft-giving-up-on-silverlight-joining-html5-party/ -- Bob Muglia, Microsoft’s president in charge of server and tools, has confirmed that the company is shifting away from Silverlight as a cross-platform development framework, and pushing the HTML5 web standard instead.

00:20  aL3x: who here has both an ipad and an ipod touch/or iphone?
00:21  diffract|: you
00:22  Angostura: Branes: And that absolutely won't  be an 'enhanced and extended' version of HTML5. Oh no
00:24  diffract|: i knew silverlight won't succeed much
00:24  Angostura: It'll be interesting to see what happens with Air

01:40  rzamana: which IRC client is recommended?
01:42  diffract|: rzamana: colloquy
01:43  ChrisAM: I prefer to use Textual. There's also Colloquy, Linkinus, X-Chat Aqua, MacIrssi
01:43  Tomis: try them all and use what oyu like, search macupdate.com and iusethis.com rzamana

03:31  ChrisAM: Branes ... you around?
03:37  Branes: Aye
03:38  ChrisAM: having a hardware issue... I've got a firewire device that I'm using for audio output. Under heavy system load, the audio stops.
03:38  ChrisAM: Have you encountered that before?
03:39  ChrisAM: I haven't pinpointed whether it's high ram or cpu when it stops.
03:39  ChrisAM: I can just unplug/replug the firewire cable, and everything works.
03:40  ChrisAM: (good day, btw :P )
03:40  Branes: Is it an M-Audio?
03:41  ChrisAM: M-Audio Firewire Solo
03:41  ChrisAM: This is an early model intel MacBook.
03:42  Branes: Back when they were still using TI's. Short of checking for a firmware update, I can't really think of what might be causing the problem.
03:42  ChrisAM: ok
03:43  Branes: I have recollection of reading somewhere that getting the Digidesign drivers can work wonders with some setups, their FWaudio stack is better than Apple's
03:54  ChrisAM: do you know what their drivers are called? Avid doesn't make it obvious on the site.
04:02  Branes: not off the top of my head, sorry
04:09  Ibuki_: hello guys, quick random question
04:09  Ibuki_: whats the difference between town and city?
04:09  Ibuki_: is a town like an urbanization?
04:10  Ibuki_: ok nevermind, foundthe answer, a town is smaller than a city, so it could mean an urbanization/appartment complex/etc right?
04:13  Ibuki_: btw HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!
04:40  fleebailey33: Thermostat lockbox from home depot. 15 dollars

05:11  hwangsta: yeah thats true
05:11  hwangsta: well you know what i mean

05:13 --- annoyingorange is now known as the_rogue_smiler
05:14  remyo: hwangsta: I have windows installed via Boot camp. Does that mean I'm running a pc?
05:14  fleebailey33: remyo: they did get bootcamp to work with hackintosh
05:14  S_SubZero: it means what you want it to mean
05:16  remyo: fleebailey33: Cool...?
05:16  hwangsta: lol
05:16  hwangsta: how r u guys ircing
05:16  remyo: hwangsta: irssi
05:16  hwangsta: assuming you're on macs
05:16 --- andrewfree_ is now known as andrewfree
05:17  fleebailey33: remyo: just saying, :P
05:17  fleebailey33: then bootcamp could be a pc
05:17  hwangsta: irssi in what form?
05:17  remyo: hwangsta: cli
05:17  hwangsta: whoa that's hard core
05:17  remyo: hwangsta: But theres a million and one gui irc clients too 
05:18  hwangsta: on what platform?
05:18  remyo: OS X
05:18  aL3x: cli?
05:18  remyo: aL3x: commandline
05:18  aL3x: oh
05:18  hwangsta: interface
05:19  hwangsta: i'm using adium
05:19  hwangsta: trying it with irc
05:19  hwangsta: does anybody game on the mac?
05:19  hwangsta: i know funny
05:19  aL3x: i use irssi sometimes....i prefer macirssi
05:20  hwangsta: gtg later mac peeps
05:25  remyo: Apparently weechat is an amazing irc client
05:25  remyo: Yet I've still not tried it
05:26  aL3x: i neever heard of it
05:29  remyo: For a cli client is looks like the configurations you can make are pretty insane. 
05:44 --- mikeplus32 is now known as mikeplus64
05:53  netdaemon: remyo: if i'm not using znc + gui client, i'm using weechat :)
05:54  netdaemon: i prefer it over irssi personally, then again i'm not a huge fan of perl...
05:56 @bashusr: irssi for the win!
05:57 @bashusr: i made an IRC bot with irssi
05:57  remyo: netdaemon: Any noteworthy features?
05:57  remyo: Of weechat that is
05:57  netdaemon: remyo: i use it for sane defaults personally :)
05:57  netdaemon: script in pretty much whatever language you want
05:57  netdaemon: i'll see if i can drag up a screenie
05:57  remyo: Thats awesome 
05:58  netdaemon: damn...don't have any available and i'm not using it right now =\
05:58  remyo: Thats cool. I should probably just install and play with it
05:58  netdaemon: i had it pretty much looking like xchat CLI
05:58  netdaemon: lol
05:58  netdaemon: left chan list, right user list
05:58  netdaemon: center was the chat buffer
05:58  netdaemon: etc etc
05:59  netdaemon: oh
05:59  netdaemon: scripting is perl, python, ruby, and something else...
05:59 @bashusr: netdaemon: wow, if weechat matures
05:59 @bashusr: and becomes truly multiclient
05:59 @bashusr: i'll switch from finch to weechat
05:59  netdaemon: it's very nice on CLI in my opinion
05:59 @bashusr: finch has a terrible ui
06:00  netdaemon: only thing is, not every terminal will let you click links :(
06:00 @bashusr: centericq is as bad
06:00  netdaemon: yes, pathetic reason XD
06:00  netdaemon: Perl, Python, Ruby, Lua and Tcl
06:16  netdaemon: actually i may switch over to weechat momentarily
06:20  netdaemon: hrm
06:20  netdaemon: say some stuff will yah!?
06:20  S_SubZero: huh
06:21  S_SubZero: iPhone
06:22  netdaemon: remyo: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8410214/Screen%20shot%202010-11-01%20at%201.20.16%20AM.png
06:23  remyo: netdaemon: I like the channel list on the left side. As well as the border it puts between nicks and their messages.
06:23  remyo: netdaemon: userlist is optional, yeah? You can hide it? 
06:23  netdaemon: remyo: yep
06:24  netdaemon: fully configurable
06:24  netdaemon: the chanlist is a plugin
06:25  remyo: netdaemon: How about commands. Do the same kind of things like /ignore /unignore /join, etc work? 
06:26  netdaemon: ignore and join do
06:26 * netdaemon hunts down the unignore equiv
06:27  remyo: irssi commands are kind of burned into my brain :P
06:28  SpaceGhostC2C: Can you boot a mac dvd using pxe?
06:28  netdaemon: ah, ignore has commands to add and delete entries
06:28  remyo: I see 
06:28  netdaemon: so /ignore add foo /ignore del bar
06:29  netdaemon: remyo: you can set aliases ;)
06:29  SpaceGhostC2C: I have the necessary setup for booting iso files, but can Mac OSX fo that?
06:30  remyo: netdaemon: Nice
06:30  SpaceGhostC2C: s/fo/for/
06:30 * netdaemon looks for a way to configure the /names command
06:30  SpaceGhostC2C: netdaemon: What program?
06:31  remyo: SpaceGhostC2C: We're talking about weechat
06:31  netdaemon: SpaceGhostC2C: weechat
06:31  netdaemon: ah, can't configure that
06:31  SpaceGhostC2C: Oh, okay.
06:31  remyo: SpaceGhostC2C: Love your nick by the way
06:31  netdaemon: remyo: i don't think the /names looks as nice as irssi's but ah well
06:31  SpaceGhostC2C: remyo: Thanks. :)
06:31  netdaemon: you saw that in the screenie
06:31  SpaceGhostC2C: netdaemon: I love me some irssi. :)
06:31  netdaemon: i don't mind it, i prefer weechat though :)
06:32  SpaceGhostC2C: Has anyone net-booted the Mac disc, or a mac install?
06:33  Kasm279|Away: i prefer xchat aqua :P
06:34  SpaceGhostC2C: I like using screen + irssi on my server, and generate statistics to display on the same servers webserver.
06:34  netdaemon: Kasm279|Away: i use limechat on OSX
06:34  netdaemon: when i'm using a gui client that is
06:35  Kasm279|Away: i haven't tried that
06:35  Kasm279|Away: also, blargh
06:35  Kasm279|Away: i can't wait to get my dana
06:35  Kasm279|Away: then i can use upIRC D:
06:35  netdaemon: but yeah, right now screen + weechat
06:35  Kasm279|Away: netdaemon: really though, if my Macs were over 400MHz i would be running KVIrc
06:35  netdaemon: i couldnt' like kvirc for some reason
06:35  Kasm279|Away: its what i prefer
06:35  SpaceGhostC2C: netdaemon: Takes some hard work to like it, I hear.
06:36  Kasm279|Away: its just got so many nice things that i always use
06:36  netdaemon: i like for nicks to have their own colors and kvirc was not condusive to that
06:36  Kasm279|Away: 4.0 was buggy as hell but its gotten better :D
06:36  Kasm279|Away: netdaemon!~netdaemon@tuxhacker/netdaemon
06:36  Kasm279|Away: ^i like that
06:36  Kasm279|Away: shift+tab instead of tab
06:36  Kasm279|Away: plus, i like the scripting interface
06:36  Kasm279|Away: and uh
06:36  Kasm279|Away: the way it identifies to NS
06:37  SpaceGhostC2C: I like how irssi does all those things.
06:37  Kasm279|Away: but its not clickable :P
06:37  Kasm279|Away: anyway, i can't wait to IRC from a palm os device :D
06:37  netdaemon: biggest thing i don't like about irssi is perl
06:37 * netdaemon starts his bouncer back up
06:37  Kasm279|Away: what else does KVIrc do >.>
06:38  Kasm279|Away: i dunno, I just haven't found another windows IRC client that i really like
06:38  Kasm279|Away: xchat for windows and linux is horribly imo
06:38  Kasm279|Away: -y
06:38  netdaemon: GTK app outside linux is horrible
06:38  netdaemon: sticks out like a sore thumb
06:39  Kasm279|Away: i usually use konversation on linux
06:39  netdaemon: and for some reason the people that port think that GTK needs to be installed separately rather than bundling it with the application, which drives me nuts
06:39  Kasm279|Away: for some reason i haven't tried kvirc on it
06:39  Kasm279|Away: the oly gtk app i use is pidgin
06:39  netdaemon: bundling as in just providing the needed libraries
06:40  Kasm279|Away: because trillian is even slower, and its native >.>
06:40  Kasm279|Away: yes i know :P
06:40  netdaemon: i mean that's all fine and dandy on your linux distro
06:40  netdaemon: thats the way it rolls...but everything else: no
06:42  Kasm279|Away: interesting
06:42  Kasm279|Away: i have no start menu entry for pidgin
06:43  netdaemon: i'v actually been trying my best to avoid GTK =\
06:44  Kasm279|Away: like i said, only gtk app i use
06:44  Kasm279|Away: then qt for kvirc
06:44  Kasm279|Away: everything else is native
06:44  Kasm279|Away: err, besides itunes
06:44  netdaemon: QT is close enough to native, lol
06:44  Kasm279|Away: yeah
06:44  netdaemon: only the icons make it stick out
06:44  Kasm279|Away: it feels native
06:44  Kasm279|Away: yeah
06:45  Kasm279|Away: GTK always takes up so much space with its toolbars
06:45  Kasm279|Away: but pidgin somehow manages to display stuff in less space than trillian
06:45  netdaemon: is there a way to give nicks colors in kvirc?
06:45  Kasm279|Away: yeah
06:45  Kasm279|Away: its in the settings osmewhere
06:46  Kasm279|Away: i haven't edited the settings forever, i just copy over the data file xD
06:46  netdaemon: i don't mean a background color either
06:46  Kasm279|Away: your nick is like this
06:46  Kasm279|Away: mine is  like this
06:46  netdaemon: i'd prefer it to be the maroon color in the font, not the background
06:46  Kasm279|Away: thats.. purple
06:46  netdaemon: whatever, you know what i meant :P
06:46  Kasm279|Away: anyway, you can't really change it
06:47  Kasm279|Away: the algorithm (?) for deciding colours seems to be hard-coded D:
06:47  Kasm279|Away: trillian is taking more time to launch than pidgin did
06:47  netdaemon: i use digsby
06:47  DoFoT9: irssi :)
06:48  Kasm279|Away: i looked at that
06:48  Kasm279|Away: but its like
06:48  Kasm279|Away: put all your info on their servers
06:48  Kasm279|Away: wtf
06:48  Kasm279|Away: trillian started skype
06:48  netdaemon: trillian does that too
06:49  Kasm279|Away: you don't have to have an astra account
06:49  netdaemon: hm
06:49 * netdaemon fetches the qt stuff for kvirc =\
06:50  Kasm279|Away: netdaemon: what OS?
06:50  netdaemon: mac
06:50  Kasm279|Away: don't need them
06:50  Kasm279|Away: just download kvirc and go
06:50  netdaemon: do need them
06:51  netdaemon: i tried that
06:51  netdaemon: :P
06:51  Kasm279|Away: o.O
06:51  netdaemon: it won't launch without fetching QT libraries
06:51  Kasm279|Away: i didn't need them when i tried
06:51  netdaemon: http://www.kvirc.net/?id=releases&platform=macosx&version=4.0.2&lang=en
06:51  netdaemon: "You need Qt4.6.3 installed on your system. Copy the bundle to a suitable location and double click."
06:52  Kasm279|Away: maybe its because i was using a different version
06:52  Kasm279|Away: was 3.4
06:52 --- Tomis2 is now known as Tomis
06:53  Kasm279|Away: bah
06:53  Kasm279|Away: how do you change the theme for gtk that pidgin installs
06:54  netdaemon: from kvirc...
06:55  Kasm279|Away: hm?
06:55  netdaemon: sitting in kvirc right now :P
06:55  Kasm279|Away: ah
06:55  netdaemon: crash
06:55  netdaemon: lol
06:56  Kasm279|Away: try a snapshot
06:56  netdaemon: hm?
06:56  Kasm279|Away: i said 4.0 was buggy :P
06:56  Kasm279|Away: Equilibrium 4.1.1, revision: 5032, sources date: 20100905, built on: 2010-09-28 08:14:15 UTC
06:56  Kasm279|Away: try 4.1
08:09  asfjio: hello guys, i have experienced a very strange thing with my iphone. the day before yesterday we had to change our clocks 1 hour backwards. on the next day mu clock alarm didn't beeped. today it beeped one hour later. i.e. if the alarm is set to 7 AM the clock says 8 AM. so people are getting late for their schedules. is this a joke from apple?
08:10  asfjio: where can i report this to apple?
08:15  LSD`: asfjio: it's known and on the cards to be fixed in 4.2 I believe
08:21  asfjio: LSD`: ah, so the story gets more ridiculous. so people have to be late at least one time and if they even understand whats happening they have to set their alarms one hour backwards. and apple waits for a major release to fix such a vital problem. i'm shicked.
08:24  LSD`: to be fair, trying to keep on top of various DST start and end dates the world over isn't the easiet job in the world. It'd be easier if everyone would get with the program and dump DST entirely :)
08:32  asfjio: LSD`: but here the problem is not when we change our clocks, because the phone changed the clock correct, the problem is that somehow the black box behind the alarm is still thinkigin the time is not changed. so the clock is not the source from which the alarm is orientating what time is it.

15:09  neekers_: i added an option to my .vimrc and now i can't open a terminal window, the prompt doesn't display, and spotlight can't find .vimrc, is there a  way to start terminal without running .vimrc?
15:09  neekers_: or get to .vimrc using finder...
15:12  ayaz: neekers_: the .vimrc file is only ever executed when you start up Vim. you should be able to open up Terminal
15:13  neekers_: ayaz: this is bizarre, i open up terminal, and just see the cursor, it's not showing the prompt or that its logged in
15:14  ayaz: neekers_: are you able to type anything into it?
15:14  neekers_: yes, i am 
15:14  ayaz: neekers_: nano ~/.vimrc
15:15  neekers_: that has no effect
15:16  neekers_: i know it's something i did, just not sure what i did...
15:16  ayaz: neekers_: i take it that you are not able to run any command on the shell. is that so?
15:16  neekers_: yes, that's correct
15:17  neekers_: i closed terminal and restarted but no change
15:20  ayaz: neekers_: if you go into the preferences for Terminal.app, and then into the 'Startup' tab, what do you have checked for 'Shell opens with' bit?
15:21  neekers_: Default login shell (/usr/bin/login)
15:23  ayaz: neekers_: could you choose the /bin/bash option, save, quit, and start Terminal again to see whether that works?
15:24  neekers_: still no change...
15:25  ayaz: neekers_: what did you do last before this started happening?
15:26  neekers_: i added a few more options to .vimrc, closed the terminal window and then reopened it
15:28  neekers_: i know you said that .vimrc is read when vim is started but is there a way to start terminal with reading any config files at all like .bashrc
15:28  ayaz: neekers_: i see. i really don't think it should have anything to do with .vimrc file. but, in any case, you could go into the preferences again, inside the 'Settings' tab, and then the 'Shell' tab, and check the 'Run command' setting with the following command set: open -a TextEdit ~/.vimrc
15:28  ayaz: that should open your .vimrc in TextEdit whenever you open a new Terminal window or tab.
15:30  neekers_: boy, that's not working either....
15:31  neekers_: why the heck doesn't spotlight find that file...
15:40  neekers_: going to reboot
15:48  neekers_: ayaz: rebooting worked but thanks for your help
15:49  ayaz: neekers_: sorry, i disconnected. did you figure out what was the issue?
16:01  neekers_: ayaz: no, i rebooted and it started working again... i just came back to thank you for the help
16:02  diffract|: anyone know where i can find music like this? especially the tunes at the beginning http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk_5RGvUMXc
16:02  ayaz: neekers_: you're welcome.
16:03  Foxdie: diffract|: Start looking towards Industrial / Chillout 
16:03  Foxdie: Also look into a band called Celldweller
16:04  diffract|: thanks Foxdie.. it's hard to find good instrumental music because it's not popular :[
16:07  Branes: diffract|: Tune into my radiostation, Psymbiensis, at http://bluesphereweb.com:2012 -- nothing but the best in ambidelica, downtempo and chilled beats with a dash of dub & a twist of world. All instrumental, no electric guitars. Runs 24/7 :)
16:08  Foxdie: Woo
16:08  Foxdie: I'll have a bit of that
16:08  Branes: Well, you may hear a bit of voice in the occasional track, but as a sample'd phrase, no lyrics.
16:08  diffract|: Branes: wish i know how.. i don't have iTunes
16:09  diffract|: i use Cog
16:09  diffract|: nevermind.. quicktime worked
16:09  Branes: I don't use iChewns either, you just need a player that can handle a shoutcase .pls MP3 stream
16:10  Foxdie: Using iTunes here, works fine :)
16:10  Branes: Bookmark it if you like it, its been running almost continually now for four years.
16:11  LSD`: VLC /win 38
16:11  diffract|: Branes: problem is, i wouldn't know the name of a track that i like
16:11  LSD`: bah
16:11  Tomis: how can you tell they all sound the same, mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch  mm ch 
16:12  IIoTeP9HuY: Help! I want to merge my partitions( disk0s2 and disk0s3 ), but standart command saves disk0s2 data and deletes disk0s3 . I want to save Data on disk0s3 and delete it on disk0s2!
16:12  Tomis: backup, delete partition, copy data back over IIoTeP9HuY 
16:12  Branes: IIoTeP9HuY: Back everything up to another drive. OSX won't let you merge partitions.
16:12  IIoTeP9HuY: =( no other ways?
16:12  Branes: nuh-uh
16:13  Foxdie: diffract|: You mean, you're looking for a particular track and don't know what it's called?
16:13  IIoTeP9HuY: OSX can merge them
16:13  IIoTeP9HuY: diskulit mergeVolumes
16:13  Tomis: then do that and see how it goes IIoTeP9HuY 
16:13  Branes: diffract|: You could try Audion as a player, that handles streams and displays the track info ... it's powerpc only so you'd need to have Rosetta installed
16:13  Tomis: why ask the question if you think you already know the answer
16:14  diffract|: Foxdie: i'm saying if i tune in to Branes's radiostation, i wouldn't know the name of the tracks that are playing
16:14  Foxdie: Or you're concerned you'll listen with quicktime and not be able to see the track title of what's currently playing?
16:14  Foxdie: If it's the latter.. http://bluesphereweb.com:2012/played.html
16:14  diffract|: oh, nice
16:14  Tomis: just use itunes then diffract| , it shows that info

17:21  MobGod: crilly u around ?
17:25  MobGod: can someone tell me what to use if I want a password on a zip file ??
17:25  Foxdie: the zip command in terminal?
17:27  Foxdie: zip -er9 file.zip files-to-add
17:27  Foxdie: You'll get prompted for a password when you do that
17:27  Foxdie: For example, if you wanted to zip up a folder called "music" into backups.zip, you'd do
17:28  Foxdie: zip -er9 backups.zip music
17:28  Branes: eww. CleanArchive. Drop your files on whilst holding control (I think) and it'll ask for a password, then make the .zip
17:28  Foxdie: -e encrypts and asks for password, -r tells zip to recurse into subdirectories if you specify one, −9 makes it compress a lot more than default
17:28  Foxdie: ;)
17:28  Foxdie: Old school CLI ftw! :)
17:28  Branes: None of this commandline rubbish - use the GUI!

17:29  Foxdie: The song thats on right now, it's making my head throb
17:30  Branes: MobGod: The commandline is inherently, irrevocably and irreversibly full of fail. Use the GUI.
17:30  MobGod: what GUI ??
17:30  MobGod: what program ?
17:30  Foxdie: "CleanArchive" I believe
17:31  Branes: He buys a Mac and asks "what GUI". Idiota!
17:31  Branes: Yes, the program's name is CleanArchive. Nice, simple, drag-n-drop.

18:22  peepz: has anyone here used a regular monitor on mac? I wonder how it looks
18:22  jeremyw: Regular monitor?
18:23  peepz: a non-mac monitor
18:23  jeremyw: They...look the same.
18:23  peepz: even the colors?
18:23  peepz: I thought mac monitors have better color and stuff
18:23  jeremyw: Apple makes good monitors but so do many other people.  Samsung monitors are amazing.
18:24  peepz: acer monitors are better then samsung
18:24  CEnTR4L: http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/11/01/youre-too-stupid-to-review-the-macbook-air-if/
18:25  CEnTR4L: I find this offensive because it involved the lack of firewire & ethernet.
18:26  CEnTR4L: Ethernet is still a widely & practical method of connecting to the internet/network/s
18:31  Branes: peepz: No such thing as a "regular" monitor.
18:32  Angostura: CEnTR4L: You can get an adapter, though
18:32  Branes: peepz: The technology that goes into the making of the monitor -- specifically the panel type -- is what determines the quality of the image. It is worth noting that the term 'quality' will be subjective.
18:33  CEnTR4L: I think what peepz means by "regular" monitor is a monitor that actually depends on a VGA input and a DVI as luxury-advanced option :P
18:33  Branes: Cheap is as cheap does, I suppose :)
18:34  peepz: u got it juice
18:35  CPng|N: it's 2010, time to update your monitor ;)
18:35  peepz: lol
18:35  Branes: Considering it costs extra to be able to get analogue (SVGA) signals out of a Mac these days, and the quality ends up being lower anyway *because* it is analogue ...
18:35  clustermagnet: hey guys, does anyone know hot to read crash logs :) ?
18:35  clustermagnet: http://pastebin.ca/1978824
18:36  peepz: what I am trying to say is... is a samsung 27" and a mac cinema 27" of same image quality
18:36  peepz: clustermagnet: I do
18:36  Branes: peepz: Some are, some are not.
18:36  clustermagnet: itunes keeps crashing... i have tried reinstalling it... and have checked md5 checksums... same stuff
18:36  CPng|N: laugh all you want. if all you have is VGA, it's likely to only look half-decent even with the best monitors
18:36  clustermagnet: peepz: http://pastebin.ca/1978824  Do you mind reading ?  thank you!!!!!!!
18:36  peepz: CPng|N: I have samsung 27" LED with hdmi
18:36  clustermagnet: peepz: itunes v 10.0.1
18:36  vxla: any of you folks have external blue ray players for your MBP? I'm looking for something to play my BR discs.
18:37  CEnTR4L: I don't.
18:37  Branes: peepz: Apple's displays all use true 24-bit, high-speed IPS panels. Samsung make some monitors with IPS, some with MVA, and far too many with TN - and TN, being the cheapest and thus the most common, can only do 18 bits.
18:37  CEnTR4L: But I wouldn't suggest watching your BDs on your Mac.
18:37  vxla: why would you not suggest it?
18:37  CEnTR4L: Better get a Kuro series with decent BD player, i.e. PS3.
18:37  Branes: Samsun invented MVA, and whilst it can do 24-bit, it is slow, and not very sharp.
18:37  peepz: ok ... so I need to get a mac display then
18:38  Branes: No. Just something with an IPS panel.
18:38  vxla: CEnTR4L: right, I'm talking about a portable device to watch on trips. I already have a BR player at home.
18:38  peepz: Branes: what 27" IPS do you recommend
18:38  Branes: Dell's U2710 or U2711.
18:39  clustermagnet: Branes: thanks for info... does that compare well to the apple cinerama display?
18:39  CEnTR4L: That doesn't sound practical to me vxla, thus I can't get the point.
18:39  CEnTR4L: How about renting an HD movie instead?
18:39  peepz: expensive!
18:39  Branes: peepz: All IPS panels monitors are expensive.
18:39  CPng|N: is your 27" LED/hdmi display not making you happy?
18:39  Branes: Apple's are no exception.
18:39  peepz: damnit
18:39  peepz: I just want apple so I can run coda
18:39  Branes: clustermagnet: Almost identical to the Cinema as they use the exact same panel.
18:40  CPng|N: your display etype has little to do with using coda
18:40  vxla: CEnTR4L: most of what I have on BD are not online (lots of art films, criterion collection, etc.). I'll see if I can find a player.
18:41  clustermagnet: thanks Branes, 
18:41  clustermagnet: the 2711 is same price as the apple cinerama, no?
18:41  CEnTR4L: 5.1 surround sound on iTunes TV Shows isn't worth it.
18:41  CPng|N: "it"?
18:41  clustermagnet: peepz: have you had a chance ot look at the crash log?  thanks for your time man

19:06  epictetus: Hiya.

19:08  clustermagnet: jeremyw: anything that can replace itunes
19:08  Branes: clustermagnet: the fault may not be in iTunes, but in part of the core frameworks. I suggest downloading the latest OS X Combo Update for your machine and installing it.
19:08  clustermagnet: i have an android device.... a bunch of mp3s
19:08  jeremyw: clustermagnet: Songbird, from Mozilla, is nice.
19:08  clustermagnet: Branes: updating? i've checked, it says no updates available
19:09  clustermagnet: jeremyw: :) will check it out, thanks
19:09  Branes: No, manually download the Combo Update and install it.
19:09  Branes: There's a good chance it will fix whatever core framework file is damaged and stopping you from tunnig iTunes.
19:09  clustermagnet: Branes: this combo update is available from apple.com?
19:09  Branes: yes
19:10  Quiesce: Songbird isn't developed by Mozilla, it is merely decreasingly based on Firefox.
19:10  clustermagnet: Branes: hope this is it http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1049
19:13  jeremyw: Quiesce: I stand corrected.
19:13  jeremyw: Still, solid app.
19:13  jeremyw: Technically, they describe themselves as "Songbird is built by a group of designers and developers that have previously worked on Winamp, Netscape Navigator, and Mozilla Firefox" for anyone that cares.
19:14  epictetus: or maybe i'm on the wrong track, a lot of message posts about workgroup manager seem to talk about it just not working sometimes.. maybe we're better off figuring out how to manage the allowed application list manually and pushing it out via a login script or something 
19:17  clustermagnet: jeremyw: i like that :)
19:33  epictetus: no bites, quiet in here... does anyone use workgroup manager at all?
19:34  webPragmatist: how do you go back to the window where you tag facees with iphoto?
