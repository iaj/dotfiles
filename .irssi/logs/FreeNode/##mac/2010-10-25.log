00:19  crilly: I'm wondering if i want icons on my desktop. i find thme so messy
00:40  the_rogue_smiler: penis
00:40  crilly: you're missing one.
00:43  Kasm279: lmao
00:48  crilly: Kasm279: Do you think a channel separate to this one (as this is the more general help/social channel) which ran "lectures" on Apple/Mac/OS X subjects would work? I'm thinking mute the channel, have the lecturer run through the lecture, unmuting it from time to time for questions and/or using a bot to take questions whilst the lecture runs.
00:48  Kasm279: hm
00:48  Kasm279: maybe
00:49  crilly: So, instead of discussing it all in here with everyone talking amongst them selves, you'd have a dedicated channel that discusses certain subjects in detail on a schedule.
00:49  Kasm279: yeah
00:49  Kasm279: sounds like #ubuntu-classroom :D
00:49  crilly: I think it's a good idea. I might work on it through the week.
00:50  crilly: yeah exactly!
00:50  crilly: hmm in fact I should see how they run their classes
00:51  crilly: OK, bed time.
00:52  crilly: richardcavell: keep an eye on the_rogue_smiler ;)
00:53  richardcavell: yeah I just came in in time to see that
00:55  diffract|: where can i find music like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLnpwshjjQE

01:10  richardcavell: You know, I think the ability to clone the internal hard disk should be built into OS X
01:10  richardcavell: It's built into Windows 7
01:11  Tomis: it is richardcavell, disk utility
01:11  acous: isn't it? i'm pretty sure i cloned my drive to an external
01:14 --- WarpZone_ is now known as WarpZone
01:14  richardcavell: Tomis: ah now you're right
01:15  richardcavell: still it makes an .iso rather than a clone
01:15  richardcavell: no I'm wrong it can clone too
01:16  Tomis: if you want to image to another partition, look at the restore tab
01:16  Tomis: drag in source part, destination part, and go
01:16  richardcavell: no you're right
01:16  richardcavell: That's really helpful actually because I can do it over a network
01:17  richardcavell: I have an NAS attached to my router
01:17  richardcavell: So I can clone the whole disk as a .dmg
01:17  richardcavell: wow
01:17  richardcavell: See, Windows 7 Home Premium can't do that
01:17  richardcavell: clone over a network
01:18  richardcavell: Oh this is sweet - cloning my internal hard disk to a .dmg on my NAS through my router
01:18  richardcavell: They should call the tab 'Backup' instead of 'Restore' though
01:22  mrh: i deleted a photo on mistkae on my iphone4. is it possible to get it back?
01:23  Tomis: afaik, no
01:24  Tomis: unless it was an image that was synced from your mac of course
01:28  diffract|: do you want to clone a drive? or do you want to argue why windows is better by having this feature?
01:30  mrh: can i do it on a windows box?
01:30  mrh: cause that would be cool to. 
01:30  mrh: i got both
01:33 --- richardcavell_ is now known as richardcavell
01:33  richardcavell: diffract|: Hi.
01:34  richardcavell: Yes, I keep clones of all my internal hard disks
01:34  diffract|: hi
02:31  MrUnagi: when is office 2011 suppose to be out
02:34  remyo: Applescript question. When using set position and set size is there a way to use percentages instead of pixel values? 
02:47  Tomis: look at the dictionary for the app in question remyo 
02:47  Tomis: you'll probably have to just do the math yourself
02:49  remyo: Tomis: Alright 
03:03  diffract|: is it safe to move iLife apps to the trash?
03:13  osxdude|iPad: diffract|: there are a lot of files thrown in Library folders...
03:14  osxdude|iPad: burning cd
03:14  osxdude|iPad: k
03:15  diffract|: osxdude|iPad: you think apptrap won't be able to locate them?
03:17  Tomis: define "safe" diffract| 
03:17  Tomis: there's a bunch of stuff they instal into shared locations
03:18  Tomis: garageband especially, installs all those GB worth of loops
03:18  diffract|: "safe" just means the system won't be unstable/i won't notice anything
03:18  diffract|: the only change would be getting more hard disk space
03:18  Tomis: of course
03:18  Tomis: they're just apps
03:19  Tomis: it's not like they're System Preferences.app or something essential like that
03:19  iui: anyone use FINK ? wondering if its anygood
03:27  danl: iui: from experience, I prefer macports
03:32  iui: hrm
03:32  iui: damn
03:33  iui: i just installed fink :x
03:33  iui: i heard macports might be slower?
03:33  iui: in terms of getting packages
03:34  danl: there were quite a few things I didn't like about fink, but honestly, it's been a while and I don't remember waht they were
03:35  iui: im generally new to mac
03:35  iui: im trying to fucking just upgrade the subversion that comes stock with snow leopard
03:35  iui: its like .6 latest version is .13
03:35  iui: compiling from svn sources seemed a nightmare
03:44  danl: iui: please watch the language in here
03:44  iui: oh my bad
03:45  iui: well, fink installed
03:46  nuonguy: this morning finder started to crash frequently, like ever 5 minutes or so
03:46  nuonguy: so, heeding the advice I found online, I repaired the disk, erased com.apple.finder.plist, remove ~/.DS_Store and rebooted
03:47  nuonguy: and for an hour or more the problem went away
03:47  nuonguy: but now it seems to do it every 10-15 minutes, haven't timed it
03:47  nuonguy: what could possible cause this?
03:48  Kasm279: nuonguy: could be RAM >.>
03:48  Kasm279: possibly
03:48  nuonguy: the machine seems perfectly stable
03:48  Kasm279: i doubt it, but its possible
03:48  Kasm279: hm
03:48  nuonguy: when I say the finder crashes I mean that the apps disappear, I see the blue background screen on both monitors for about 5 seconds, and then everything is back to normal
03:49  nuonguy: I don't see any crash messages inside the logs when I read them via console
03:50  nuonguy: this morning, when I first powered up the machine, it was probably more frequent than every 5 minutes, sometimes it seems like it did it every 20 seconds non-stop for 3 minutes at a time
03:51  cryptic0: does iChat video only works between two mac clients?
03:58  Kasm279: crankharder: no
03:59  Kasm279: it works with other systems as welll
03:59  cryptic0: Kasm279:  was that for me?
04:00  cryptic0: I can't seem chat video button for some people on my jabber list.  I wonder why.
04:00  Kasm279: yeah
04:00  richardcavell: Can I create a .dmg image using Disk Utility onto my Desktop?  Or will the utility try to incorporate the .dmg file into itself, since it is also on the hard disk that it is archiving?
04:00  cryptic0: these people have webcams and microphones.
04:01  nuonguy: cryptic0: what program are they using?
04:02  nuonguy: I don't know of any free apps for windows that do jabber+video+audio
04:02  cryptic0: nuonguy:  they're logged in through gmail
04:03  nuonguy: I've never tried gmail+ichat
04:05  Tomis: you can't image the boot volume richardcavell 
04:05  Tomis: you'd need to boot from another disk, then image the system
04:06  Kasm279: ^
04:20  richardcavell: Tomis: you sure I can't image the boot volume?
04:20  richardcavell: I appear to be doing it right now
04:21  Tomis: that was my understanding yes richardcavell 
04:22  richardcavell: well it seems to be going
04:22  richardcavell: I don't think I'd be able to restore from it while booted from the disk
04:22  richardcavell: I'd have to restore from, say, my installation DVD
04:22  richardcavell: My concern is that I don't want the .dmg to archive itself
04:23  richardcavell: It's been going about 5 hours and it's 53 Gigs so far
04:24  Tomis: well are you storing the DMG on the volume you're trying to image?
04:24  richardcavell: yes
04:24  Tomis: oh man
04:24  richardcavell: I tried storing it on an external drive but the external drive gets disconnected every couple of hours
04:25  Tomis: that's weird
04:25  richardcavell: it's an NAS
04:25  Tomis: i've heard of drives disconnecting when their idle/powersave kicks in
04:25  richardcavell: every couple of hours it disconnects and reconnects for no good reason
04:25  Tomis: but it shouldn't do it while it's active
04:25  richardcavell: I've tried setting DHCP lease time to a week
04:25  richardcavell: but it still does
04:26  richardcavell: so is my .dmg going to recursively include itself until my internal hard disk spills over?
04:27  Tomis: only one way to find out
04:27  Tomis: i'm surprised they even let you image the active boot volume
04:27  richardcavell: well it's only reading the boot volume
04:27  richardcavell: If I tried to restore to it while booted from it, then there'd be fireworks, I'm sure
04:28  richardcavell: My .dmg is now 57 Gigs and the progress bar is about 25%
04:28  FriedBob: richardcavell: How much are you imaging?
04:28  richardcavell: I've got a bad feeling about this
04:28  richardcavell: FriedBob: 88 Gigs
04:30  FriedBob: I'm not great at math, but only way 57 gig could be 25% of 88 is if you have a handful of BIG files and then billions of small ones and the % is based on file numbers not size....
04:30  Tomis: fun experiment richardcavell 
04:30  richardcavell: Tomis: yeah
04:30  richardcavell: ...
04:32  FriedBob: richardcavell: I would watch the size, and if it goes much over 88 gig, kill the proccess and nuke the image
04:33  richardcavell: FriedBob: yeah that's what I'm doing
04:33  richardcavell: One of the problems with really huge disk drives is that it takes ages to access all of the data on them
04:33  richardcavell: I mean, to transfer all the data off a 1 terabyte hard disk would take weeks
04:33  Tomis: get a faster drive richardcavell 
04:34  Tomis: and stop using USB2 for everything
04:34  richardcavell: Tomis: I did get a faster drive!
04:34  The_Tick: usb2 sucks, heh
04:34  richardcavell: That's why I'm imaging to my internal drive - cos it's faster
04:34  Tomis: where by fibre channel at yo!
04:34  Kasm279: firewire 400 > USB2
04:34  richardcavell: 7200 rpm, 250 Gig Seagate
04:34  The_Tick: Tomis: I almost typed that, sort of
04:34  Tomis: 400? too slow!
04:34  The_Tick: richardcavell: that's slow
04:34  The_Tick: 72k rpm is bleh
04:34  The_Tick: 10k mang
04:34  richardcavell: It's in a laptop so it can be moved around
04:35  LSD`: 72000rpm is dar from bleh, heh
04:35  The_Tick: LSD`: no it is bleh
04:35  LSD`: I believe you meant 7.2k rpm ;)
04:35  The_Tick: LSD`: it's irc
04:35  Tomis: 72000RPM would be insane
04:35  The_Tick: you know what I mean
04:35  Tomis: are there 10,000rpm laptop drives?
04:35  LSD`: The_Tick: 0 rpm is the best though ;)
04:35  The_Tick: you said fibre channel Tomis 
04:35  richardcavell: Tomis: dunno
04:35  The_Tick: are there fibre channel cards for laptops? ;)
04:35  richardcavell: There are 15,000 rpm server drives
04:36  Tomis: i don't care The_Tick , i want it
04:36  Tomis: and i want it now
04:36  The_Tick: Tomis: go make it
04:36  The_Tick: make billions
04:36  Tomis: where's lightpeak
04:36 * FriedBob points.
04:36  FriedBob: Over there.
04:36  The_Tick: LSD`: ssd is nice, yes
04:36  richardcavell: SSDs have yet to come into their element
04:37  richardcavell: once they figure out how to parallelise the writes, then they'll be many times faster than a mechanical drive
04:37  richardcavell: Like a RAID array inside the controller
04:37  Tomis: just get two SSD richardcavell 
04:37  Tomis: or have it self-RAIDed
04:37  The_Tick: they just need 2 controllers per drive
04:37  The_Tick: to make that work
04:37  LSD`: richardcavell: they already are like that
04:37  The_Tick: if that's still an issue
04:38  osxdude: oops
04:38  osxdude: I left Colloquy open on osxdude|iPad 
04:38  LSD`: The big problem with SSDs right now is reliability
04:38  richardcavell: still they're not faster enough
04:38  richardcavell: that's probably true
04:38  richardcavell: mechanical drives are insanely reliable
04:38  Tomis: i'd say the problem is the price
04:38  richardcavell: and speed
04:38  richardcavell: someone once built a 'hard disk' out of RAM
04:38  Tomis: mmmm
04:38  Tomis: SSD backed RAM
04:39  richardcavell: and they booted Windows 2000 off it - it took 7 seconds versus 1.50 off a normal hard disk
04:39  FriedBob: richardcavell: RAM disks are nothing new.
04:39  LSD`: richardcavell: define "faster enough", they're already hitting the ceiling of 3.0Gb/s SATA whereas mechanical drives are nowhere near saturating even 1.5Gbit
04:39  The_Tick: richardcavell: who the hell uses windows 2000 to test?
04:39  richardcavell: well they should consistently be at the limit
04:39  richardcavell: this was years ago
04:39  richardcavell: I'm just saying
04:39  richardcavell: RAMdisk blows everything away
04:40  The_Tick: you're using outdated information
04:40  The_Tick: apparently
04:40  richardcavell: and they found a race condition in the Linux kernel by accident that way
04:40  The_Tick: who cares about boot time if you only reboot once every 4 years? ;)
04:40  richardcavell: ha ha
04:40  richardcavell: true
04:40  The_Tick: data access time
04:40  The_Tick: is what you care about
04:41  The_Tick: boot time is some bs
04:41  LSD`: Tomis: I'd say price is secondary because even though they are expensive per GB, paying all that money only to have the drive die in 6 months is worse
04:41  The_Tick: what if it took 6 seconds to load the driver for ssd? ;)
04:41  Kasm279: i wonder if there are Win2k drivers for my mobo
04:41  Kasm279: i love win2k
04:41  LSD`: I loved Win2k until I used XP :P
04:41  The_Tick: you could probably use xp drivers
04:42  Kasm279: maybe
04:42  Kasm279: i mean
04:42  Kasm279: i wouldn't boot it as the normal OS
04:42  Kasm279: woud dualboot it
04:43  The_Tick: why do that at all?
04:43  diffract|: dual-booting is a huge waste of time
04:43  diffract|: either use virtual machines or nothing at all
04:46  The_Tick: ya vm's rock
04:49  richardcavell: My .dmg file finished
04:49  richardcavell: 59 Gigs.  The disk it was imaging was 88 Gigs.
04:49  richardcavell: Oh my God that's a big file
04:50  richardcavell: Now I'm scanning image for restore and this is going to take an hour

06:09  rryouumaa: thinking of installing an antivirus on tiger.  do people here like http://www.clamxav.com/ ClamXav ?
06:10  Tomis: i wouldn't bother
06:11  tanner: unless your computer boots up with a Windows logo you're at minimal risk
06:11  LSD`: ...for now ;)
06:11 * tanner rolls eyes
06:11  tanner: they've been saying that for the last decade
06:12  LSD`: ...and for the last decade nothing has come close to usurping Windows' mantle as the dominant desktop OS/target
06:12  dooks: hi, would someone point me in the right direction please? i have a firewire hd camcorder that i'd like to connect to my mac, record, but also stream. 
06:13  tanner: 10% of the global market share isn't something to scoff at
06:13  Tomis: so plug it in dooks 
06:13  rryouumaa: i like tripwire tools and similar; thought maybe an antivirus would be good too
06:13  Tomis: you can record it using any number of programs
06:14  dooks: i'd like to serve it up as a stream to watch from the internet as well
06:14  Tomis: look into darwin streaming server and quicktime streaming server for that
06:14  dooks: cool, will do. ty
06:15  Tomis: if you just need to do it one-on-one like a video chat, then look at skype, ichat, facetime, etc.
06:16  dooks: actually, i work during the day, and cage my dog up in the house while im gone, and i feel bad to lock her up. so i'd like to let her roam free, and if she goes bad dog on me, i can head home and try to salvage the situation
06:16  dooks: :)
06:17  Tomis: you need a two-way system
06:17  Tomis: then you can scold her instantly as well
06:17  dooks: lol
06:18  Tomis: you could proably just set up skype in some an auto-accept type situation
06:20  ChrisAM: you could use something like ustream
06:20  ChrisAM: it allows you to record your broadcasts.
06:22  dooks: is that ustream.tv?
06:27  The_Tick: you could get rid fo the dog
06:27  LSD`: there's an idea :)
06:27  Tomis: or get a wife to look after the dog
06:28  dooks: it's the wife's dog
06:28  Tomis: problem solved
06:28  Tomis: so the camera is really to look after the wife then
06:28  dooks: well, she works too :)
06:28  dooks: haha
06:28  dooks: considering it was her idea, perhaps it's for her to look after me
06:29  Tomis: uh oh
06:29  Tomis: sneaky plan lady, sneaky plan
06:50  richardcavell: I'm on a second-gen MacBook.  It's connected to a router and via the router to an NAS.  About every 2 hours it disconnects from the NAS.  Does anyone else experience this?
06:50  richardcavell: I used to blame the NAS but now I find that my Windows machine never disconnects from it, so now I'm blaming the Mac.
06:50  richardcavell: And it happens both when wired and wireless.
06:50  richardcavell: And sometimes when I click on 'renew DHCP lease', it comes up with a 255.255.0.0 address when everything else on the network is on a 255.255.255.0 address.
06:53  richardcavell: I have a router with an NAS, a Mac and a Windows machine all attached to it.  The Mac connects via wired and wireless routes.  About every 2 hours, the NAS comes up on the Mac as 'disconnected'  and has to reconnect.  If a file transfer is in progress, it is very annoying because it fails.  It happens consistently.  DHCP lease time is 10080 hours.  Also, every other device has a 192.168.0.x type address but when I click on 'DHCP lease 
06:53  richardcavell: renewal', it sometimes comes up as a 255.255.0.0 type address.  The NAS never disconnects from the Windows machine.  I need to transfer a 60 gig file from my Mac to the NAS and have no way of doing it.  It's a 2006 second-gen MacBook, running 10.6.4.  Any advice?
07:05 * LaraX pokes zer0her0
07:05  The_Tick: 255.255.0.0 is not an address
07:05  The_Tick: and
07:05  The_Tick: you didn't say what kind of router
07:05  The_Tick: nor that you checked for firmware updates
07:06  The_Tick: richardcavell: this is all for you btw
07:09  richardcavell: no but it's a class of address.  It ends up as 169.something.something.something.  DIR-615 DLink router, everything's fully updated
07:10  richardcavell: I'm transferring the file to the Windows machine via SMB.  Estimated time about 5 hours.  We'll see how that goes.
07:13  The_Tick: 169.254.x.x?
07:14  osxdude: o.O
07:14  The_Tick: if so, how old is the dlink?
07:14  richardcavell: not that old
07:14  richardcavell: hardware revision C2
07:15  richardcavell: It's the connection between the Mac and the router that seems to crap itself.  The windows machine and the NAS (which runs Linux internally) seem fine
07:15  richardcavell: When it happens the quickest thing to do is to log out and log in again
07:15  vxla: what is a class of address?
07:15  vxla: 169.254 is a microsoft reserved range
07:17  tripelb: hi all -- friend has an old imac, version 83.00 - 10.2.8  --- He's not online. What do I need to get him to be able to play an .avi file ?? --- or can he already do that?  Please tell me..
07:17  vxla: tripelb: i like VLC
07:17  tripelb: ok, can I load it from a flash drive with no internet?
07:18  tripelb: connection.
07:19  tripelb: VideoLAN - VLC media player for Mac OS X
07:19  tripelb: VLC for Mac OS X is distributed as a disk image. -- will this work from a flash drive?
07:19  tripelb: vxla ^^^^
07:19  storkop: It will work if you can access the FILE
07:19  storkop: Regardless of what the medium is.
07:20  tripelb: what file do you mean? (I'm trying to anticipate problems)
07:20  storkop: the .dmg?
07:21  tripelb: I found VLC for power PC. that's the one.
07:21  tripelb: It said "distributed as a disk image. I ws thinking need to burn a CD. -oops I cant do that.
07:21  tripelb: I am happy with this find.
07:21  tripelb: Thank you so much for suggesting VLC.
07:22  The_Tick: the problem
07:22  The_Tick: is that .avi
07:22  The_Tick: is a container
07:22  The_Tick: it's not a format
07:23  The_Tick: so if he says it doesn't play, it may be able to play avi files fine but not the actual codec
07:23  The_Tick: there's also mplayer os x
07:23  The_Tick: we couldn't justify putting perian out for 10.2 though
07:23  The_Tick: so don't try that
07:23  osxdude: try a different container?
07:24  osxdude: lol
07:24  The_Tick: that's like saying let's put storkop's skin on you
07:24  osxdude: indeed
