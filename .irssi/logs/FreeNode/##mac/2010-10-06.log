15:21  ndsports: hey could anybody give a ballpark figure on how much a power pc g5 - 2.0 ghz dual core, 4 gigs of ram and 250 gig hard drive, with snow mac osx 10.5 - how much that could be worth now a days?
15:22  Kasm279|Away: ndsports: im thinking around $500-750 US
15:23  ndsports: really, still worth some stuff then huh
15:23  ndsports: got one from work here, they want me to sell, so im trying to get a ballpark estimate
15:23  KaOSoFt: That worth? :o
15:23  Branes: PCI or PCI-X model?
15:24  ndsports: how can i tell?
15:24  Branes: Open it up and look inside? :)
15:24  ndsports: lol im a pc guy never opened up a power pc before
15:25  Branes: Or, go here: http://www.apple.com/support/oss/ and punch in the machine's serial number (found either in System Profiler, or on the ID strip along the lower lip just inside the side-panel)
15:25  Branes: Easy. Flip lever at back, right side will come away.
15:26  iaj: can someone tell me why I got '= ~' directories created in my $HOME all the time :\
15:26  Branes: In either case (pun not intended :)) a PowerMac G5 of that config is worth approximately US$500.
15:27  ndsports: ok popped up it off its actually a 2.5 ghz
15:27  ndsports: and its pci-x
15:28  Kasm279|Away: i want a G4 MDD :\
15:28  ndsports: so 500.00
15:29  Branes: PowerMac7,3 aka Power Macintosh G5 Late 2004. PCI-X slots plus 1 x AGPx8, eight RAM slots.
15:29  Branes: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/stats/powermac_g5_2.5_dp.html
15:30  ndsports: so 500.00 even with 4 gigs of ram and 250 gig hd huh
15:30  Branes: Depending on condition of case, whether it has built-in AirPort (wifi), and what shipped accessories are still with it, between US$450 and US$600
15:31  ndsports: well i got a keyboard and mouse, no mac monitor
15:31  Branes: They were worth US$4,500 new, y'know :)
15:31  ndsports: conditioin is great
15:31  Branes: Stock video supports DVI out, so any monitor will work.
15:32  ndsports: not sure if it has airport wifi in it
15:32  ndsports: yeah the card in here has dual dvi outputs
15:32  Branes: ndsports: Fire it up, go to 'About This Mac' under the Apple menu, then click 'More Info' to start the System Profiler. That'll tell you exactly what's inside.
15:33  ndsports: ok cool
15:33  ndsports: my boss had me try installing a xp virual machine on it, and the only route i found free, was qemu
15:33  ndsports: lol
15:33  ndsports: and the install of xp took serveral hours
15:34  Branes: Note that those old towers are incredibly greedy on the electricity stakes, 850 watts.
15:34  ndsports: i believe it
15:35  ndsports: well i get no information found when i click on airport - in about this mac
15:35  Branes: Then it doesn't have it.
15:36  ndsports: how much for a card to pop in?
15:38  Branes: Between $50 and $120
15:38  ndsports: my boss figured the machine would be worth more if i keep the software on it instead of wipping it
15:38  ndsports: cause it has a all adobe cs3 products on it
15:38  Branes: The machine must be re-sold with the original grey CD/DVDs that came with it.
15:38  ndsports: office 2004
15:39  Branes: You are not permitted to sell machines with pre-registered software.
15:39  ndsports: i dont think theres any discs with this machine or they lost them
15:39  Branes: Then it should be sold as such, with a blank hard drive.
15:40  Branes: Resale price estimate remains unchanged.
15:40  ndsports: thats fair then
15:40  Angostura: When you say "not permitted" Branes - by whom?
15:41  Branes: If you really want original discs to go with it, you can ring Apple's help phone line, give the operator the machine's serial number, a credit card number and your address, and for US$29 they will ship a new set.
15:41  Branes: Angostura: Apple, Adobe, Microsoft and whichever other company that may have made software already installed.
15:41  ndsports: ok
15:42  Angostura: OK, so this depends on the EULA
15:50  Branes: http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nc20100929a1.html -- Japan's "Large Helical Device" is the world's largest superconductor, and was built to replicate the same fusion process found in the Sun. The LHD project will begin test firing later this year, some two years ahead of California's National Fusion Center reactors.
15:55  ndsports: i guess ill toss it up online for 600.00 and let them beat me up from there
