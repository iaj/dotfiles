10:30  numberz: speaking of which... 
10:31  nocturnal: and you don't sell to people who don't want it
10:31 * numberz continues breaking bad
10:31  jsoft_: Or make millions spamming, but always put something in the header to indentify it as spam. 
10:31  jsoft_: That would be choice.

13:01 --- dnordstrom|away is now known as dnordstrom
13:01  mmav: is there a way to specify the time notifications stay on your screen PER application?
13:02  mmav: I know it can't be done using the default preference panel, but maybe there's a way by editing a config file?
13:07  nocturnal: mmav: sounds like you're asking for help with growl?
13:07  nocturnal: oh
13:07  mmav: ..obviously
13:07  nocturnal: I read your first line
13:07  nocturnal: =D

13:07  mmav: good one

14:07  crilly|w: lol
14:07  crilly|w: wake n bake?
14:17  theworkpatrol: wake n bake = weed right after getting up in the morning
14:23  numberz: doesn't bake imply that you spend ages cooking and stuff instead of just packing a cone?
14:26  theworkpatrol: nah, it implies waking up and getting high right away. :P

15:11  dnordstrom: Her only interests seem to be Facebook and SMS
15:11  crilly|w: Facebook do credits/topup voucher things
15:11  crilly|w: I'm not sure what you spend them on, exactly, but I've seen them.
15:11  dnordstrom: crilly|w: That's actually a good point, but I kinda don't want to give some materialistic stuff that makes her stare even more into monitors every day
15:11  dieideeistgut: send her lots of SMS with "facebook" as content?
15:12  crilly|w: lol
15:12  dnordstrom: I can send her lolcats, always makes people hally

15:15  dnordstrom: Really nice
15:16  dnordstrom: Thanks for reassuring me it's a good idea, crilly. I'll go look for something.
15:16  dieideeistgut: 12 year olds love cinema, burgers n to chill out with older bros :)
15:16  dnordstrom: Good point too
15:17  dnordstrom: Was also thinking I could check how much a return ticket to Amsterdam is, and perhaps get her one of those. Since she lives in Sweden and I live in Amsterdam.
15:17  dnordstrom: Or send her a pound of shrooms?
15:18  dieideeistgut: i'll be in A'dam in 4 days :)
15:18  crilly|w: dnordstrom: hehe
15:18  dieideeistgut: my own personal x-mas present

16:12  zer0her0: you're mean
16:12  zer0her0: meanie
16:13  MrUnagi: anyone have any idea how to set up an ftp server or vnc server to where the ONLY port used is 80
16:16  MrUnagi: i lost inet so i didnt see any replies if there were any
16:27  crilly|w: MrUnagi: Yeah, set the server to use port 80?
16:27  crilly|w: then firewall everything else off
16:28  dnordstrom: I mean FTP/VNC is configured to listen to certain ports so yeah, config it I guess
16:28  zer0her0: you can't have 2 servers on one port
16:29  crilly|w: yes you can.
16:29  crilly|w: technically you can, anyway
16:29  crilly|w: You can multiplex a port, but I can't see why you would want to
16:30  zer0her0: yea
16:30  crilly|w: Just give each process its own and firewall everything else off
16:31  MrUnagi: crilly|w: doesnt work if packet inspection detects the protocol
16:31  MrUnagi: i would like to find some way to access my server from anywhere
16:31  zer0her0: MrUnagi: stop trying to hack the pentagon
16:31  MrUnagi: close
16:31  MrUnagi: lol
16:31  zer0her0: i figured ;)
16:32  MrUnagi: access my stuff from DoD laptops
16:32  MrUnagi: :D
16:32  zer0her0: i know
16:32  zer0her0: and we wonder why we have leaks.
16:32  MrUnagi: :D
16:33  MrUnagi: eh, don't think accessing my stuff through a web browser on a non secure laptop produces leaks
16:33  MrUnagi: only thing that circulates on those laptops are fou
16:33  zer0her0: ftp & vnc is not a web browser
16:33  MrUnagi: i know
16:33 --- yazdmich is now known as Percy_Jackson
16:33  MrUnagi: trying to find a way to do it through a web browser
16:34  MrUnagi: so that it is using only port 80
16:35  crilly|w: Proxy server.
16:35  MrUnagi: cant use proxy
16:35  MrUnagi: i should probably stop lol
16:35  zer0her0: yes
16:35  crilly|w: No idea then. I can only think you either run each service on a separate server, or on individual ports.

16:35  zer0her0: ;)
16:36  MrUnagi: lol

16:40  zer0her0: yea, i don't even work w/ kids, i work in media arts dept, make the websites/videos/installations for education and museums
16:40  zer0her0: want to research new technology have to head to the local cafe or head home
16:40  millerti: I keep getting these dialog boxes popping up asking me for permission to let the current app (whichever one I'm using) access the internet, but it disappears before I can click anything.  What's going on?
16:42  crilly|w: millerti: sounds like the built in firewall, but I can't understand why it's disappearing like that
16:42  crilly|w: zer0her0: that's why I won't work in the public sector - it's too restricted
16:42  millerti: Took me some searches, but I found some others talking about it:  http://superuser.com/questions/100013/why-does-the-mac-os-x-firewall-dialog-recurringly-pop-up-and-disappear-by-itself
16:44  zer0her0: crilly|w: i've also had it happen when I worked at banks and private hospitals
16:44  zer0her0: unfortunately it happens in alot of places.
16:45  crilly|w: zer0her0: Must be a US thing.
16:45  zer0her0: yea in UK they just WATCH every move you make
16:45  zer0her0: ;)
16:45  zer0her0: and yes I do think it's a US culture type thing
16:46  MrUnagi: net neutrality 
16:46  zer0her0: net neutrality has nothing to do w/ this
16:46  MrUnagi: the government
16:47  zer0her0: net neutrality is about ISP not wanting to simply being relegated to be pipes.
16:47  zer0her0: and leaning on the gov to do something
16:47  zer0her0: hurray for big business!
16:47  MrUnagi: ranch dressing

16:56  zer0her0: it's a joke, figuring out wifi issues can be a pain
16:56  AnthonyCat: lol :)
16:57  zer0her0: i'd suggest switching to 802.11n and use the 5Ghz freq only
16:57  AnthonyCat: I don't think I can, because there are devices using 802.11g, and I don't have the dual band aiport router
16:57  AnthonyCat: I'll give it a shot
16:58  zer0her0: 2.4Ghz(what 802.11b/g/n use) is also used for cordless phones, other peoples wireless networks, garage door openers, microwave ovens, CCTVs, baby monitors, snow blowers and cribbage boards.
16:59  AnthonyCat: There is only a microwave in my house, and I can't pick up any other wifi networks. So probably not the problem, but it might be
17:01  AnthonyCat: brb
17:05  AnthonyCat: 5 GHz works well, thanks zer0her0. I think I will have to either move the router, or buy the dual band airport
17:06  zer0her0: AnthonyCat: welcome. yea it's annoying i'm much in the same boat about having g/n stuff
17:06  zer0her0: just recently upgraded my router
17:06  zer0her0: holy change in network stability/speed/reception batman
17:06  AnthonyCat: what router did you have and what do you have now?
17:06  zer0her0: ok why does CS5 insist on hiding history

17:13  _pg_: can anyone recommend a good vnc over ssh tut for osx?
17:14  _pg_: or better yet, can I ssh over a port besides 22? b/c i dont have physical access to server atm
17:15  khem_: I got a Macbook 7.1, anyone know where I can learn of the keymap of my computer?
17:17  AnthonyCat: _pg_: you can change the port that ssh uses.
17:17  _pg_: from client?
17:17  AnthonyCat: no, only at the server
17:18  _pg_: F stick
17:18  _pg_: planning ahead ftw
17:19  AnthonyCat: You can have it on port 22 at the server, and then have a router port forward it from another port
17:19  _pg_: yeah, but Im not at the server. i just thought i could use the vnc port instead
17:24  khem_: Where can I learn Macbook 7.1 layout?
17:24  _pg_: what do you mean layout?
17:25  _pg_: cant you tell by looking at it or am I not understanding
17:25  khem_: key layout
17:25  khem_: no i want to learn the special characters
17:25  _pg_: like English US or 
17:25  khem_: for programming
17:25  _pg_: oh
17:27  _pg_: unsure-i dont understand enough about what youre trying to do i guess
17:27  khem_: i want to learn how to type dollarsigns, pipes etc 
17:29  _pg_: use the shift key?
17:29  _pg_: shift 4 =$
17:29  khem_: shirt and what more? :) 
17:29  khem_: i get Euro on mine :P
17:29  _pg_: ah now i et it lol
17:29  khem_: hehe probably just the En-US layout you get the dollar
17:32  _pg_: try option shift 4
17:32  _pg_: or option shift 3
17:32  snL20: option 7
17:32  _pg_: on us option shift 3 is bristish pound when set to UK english
17:33  _pg_: i think
17:33 * _pg_ is random/unhelpful
17:33  khem_: oh option 7 is pipe
17:33  snL20: fire up the keyboard helper and see what's available ?
17:33  khem_: i got pretty much what is needed now 
17:33  khem_: thanks heaps 
17:34  snL20: :D
17:34  _pg_: I am a noob on ssh. do i use the homedir name as it says in sharing prefpane or do i use the username for "enable these users only?"
17:36  snL20: _pg_: username iirc
17:36  _pg_: huh?
17:36  snL20: if I recall correctly ?
17:36  _pg_: ssh traffic is tcp only right
17:36  _pg_: snL20: why would the ssh username be iirc?
17:36  snL20: durrr
17:37  snL20: IIRC: if I recall correctly
17:37  _pg_: oh
17:37  _pg_: lol
17:37  snL20: :D
17:37  _pg_: facepalm myself
17:38  _pg_: im trying to set up ssh via vnc on my iphone XD
17:38  _pg_: cause the network im on blocks vnc
17:38  _pg_: what a hot mess
17:38  snL20: vnc via ssh
17:39  _pg_: i had to vnc in via iphone and open port 22 and enable ssh but i still cant see open ssh port from here but i can from server
17:39  _pg_: on top of that i dont know how to vnc over ssh if i was to get it working
17:40  snL20: ssh -L23456:localhost:5900 ssh_host
17:40  _pg_: can you break that down for me?
17:40 * dnordstrom found chocolate, yay
17:41  snL20: -L23456 opens port 23456 on the host you are on and connects it via ssh to localhost:5900 on the remote host running ssh
17:41  snL20: -L23456:localhost:5900
17:42  snL20: so after connecting via ssh like that run the vncclient and connect to localhost:23456
17:42  _pg_: hmmm sounds promising
17:42  snL20: if that works on iphone I have no idea =)
17:43  _pg_: could not resolve ssh_host
17:43  snL20: but that's how I do it from computer to computer
17:43  _pg_: no im on mac lol iphone was just to open port 22 on server
17:43  snL20: _pg_: well ssh_host should be the ip of the machine running ssh and vncserver
17:43  _pg_: ah
17:44  snL20: sshd*
17:45  _pg_: where does all the password and authentication happen?
17:46  snL20: _pg_: hmmm ?
17:46  _pg_: dont i need to authenticate to ssh and vnc on server?
17:47  snL20: _pg_: you auth to ssh when you connect with the ssh command
17:48  snL20: _pg_: and then you connect with the vnc client on the host you've opened the tunnel with the ssh command to localhost:23456
17:48  snL20: _pg_: then it will ask for vnc pass
17:49  _pg_: can i use a dyndns hostname instead of IP for ssh_host?
17:49  _pg_: b/c im getting operation timed out
17:49  _pg_: or perhaps does that first port need to be opened? that 23456?
17:50  snL20: _pg_: dns name should be fine
17:50  snL20: _pg_: ssh should open that port after connecting :)
17:51  _pg_: ah i see
17:51  _pg_: why else might my operation timeout?
17:51  _pg_: is ssh impervious to outbound firewalls
17:51  _pg_: cause that is my problem in the first place
17:51  snL20: _pg_: not likely =)
17:51  snL20: _pg_: firewalls can always fuck things up
17:52  _pg_: well this fw is not letting me vnc, so ssh is to get around that. but if it is blocking ssh...
17:52  _pg_: or more likely im just doing it wrong
17:53  etcetera: I'm trying to setup an smb share hosted on my mac.
17:54  etcetera: is there a more convenient alternative to access files hosted on a mac, from windows?
17:54  locojay: hi seems like skype is down ! anyone else experiencing this
17:55  etcetera: hmm, seems FTP is far more convenient.

18:00  fujisan: Branes: knows ask him :)
18:00  fujisan: zer0her0:  :D
18:01  zer0her0: MrUnagi: why do you want to desolder a CPU?
18:01  fujisan: Branes:  is the mastercontroller when it comes to Macs
18:01  MrUnagi: to solder a replacement :D
18:01  snL20: zer0her0: I always thought it was ninja chinese 
18:01  snL20: =D
18:01  fujisan: MrUnagi: you can solder?
18:01  zer0her0: MrUnagi: yea 1) can you solder? 2) is there a replacement you can buy?
18:01  MrUnagi: yup
18:02  fujisan: i tried to solder
18:02  fujisan: its very hard :(
18:02  fujisan: you have to be quick
18:02  fujisan: i prefer legos
18:02  _pg_: ask a ninja robot to help you out
18:05  MrUnagi: what the heck did arm do for their stock to skyrocket 2 days in a row
18:06  fujisan: MrUnagi: you are getting the new pentium?
18:06  MrUnagi: no
18:06  fujisan: which cpu then?
18:06  fujisan: a SSD one?
18:06  fujisan: with 7 icores
18:06  MrUnagi: what are you talking about
18:07  fujisan: the 7 icores from pentium with SSD rambusboost
18:08  fujisan: im joking dont worry
18:08  fujisan: :D
18:08  fujisan: i meant the i7 from intel
18:09  _pg_: my ssh operation times out every time
18:09  _pg_: whats the magic?
18:09  fujisan: get a bouncer
18:09  fujisan: oh you mean magic
18:10  fujisan: http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_does_mathemagic.html       
18:10  fujisan: there is the magic
18:10  _pg_: XD
18:15  jdahm: I have some voice memos on my iPhone that are not syncing to my computer (only one of them synced)
18:15  _pg_: jdahm: email em
18:15  _pg_: :P
18:15  jdahm: _pg_: they are *huge*
18:16  jdahm: i.e. 1-2 hours of recording
18:16  _pg_: jdahm: ftp them :P
18:16  jdahm: my iPhone is not hacked...
18:16  jdahm: I would rather they just get off my iPhone like they should
18:16  _pg_: bummer-
18:16  _pg_: have you tried turning it off and on again?
18:16  jdahm: is there any reason why they wouldn't get off it?
18:16  _pg_: (the IT crowd) anyone?
18:16  jdahm: yeah I've tried everything!
18:17  jdahm: _pg_: ! yes!
18:17  jdahm: I know the IT crowd
18:17  jdahm: well I'm going to the apple store anyway later today
18:17  jdahm: might as well bring this
18:17  _pg_: are you sure its plugged in
18:17  _pg_: lol
18:17  jdahm: haha
18:17  _pg_: Make a GB appointment before you go please
18:17  _pg_: ;)
18:18  fujisan: jdahm: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7C8tJos0zE
18:18  _pg_: "WTF I need an appointment?!?!"
18:18  fujisan: play that song there :O
18:18  jdahm: _pg_: thats normally what I do
18:18  jdahm: then start ranting
18:18  fujisan: jdahm:  play that song and you wont need one
18:18  fujisan: :O
18:18  jdahm: eventually they help me
18:18  fujisan: all you need is this tune http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7C8tJos0zE
18:19  fujisan: jdahm:  :D
18:19  fujisan: you are at least lucky enough to ever been in a real Apple Store
18:19  _pg_: jdahm: they hate you
18:20  _pg_: lol
18:20  _pg_: jdahm: dont be that guy
18:20  fujisan: that guy makes some good apple tunes
18:20  fujisan: he could have been rich if he sold it on itunes
18:20  fujisan: but he choose to give the song away for free
18:20  jdahm: oh gosh
18:21  jdahm: it's so cheesy
18:21  fujisan: that's what makes it so great :D
18:22  fujisan: jdahm:  and now i am listening to the theme for BTTF :)
18:23  fujisan: and jdahm you can get the first episode for free from telltale :O
18:23  fujisan: of the new BTTF game for os x
18:23  fujisan: it wont be out until february though
18:24  jdahm: ohh... I have no idea what bttf is
18:24  jdahm: anyway, I need to go run some errands.  I'll let this channel know what my solution was when I find it!
18:25  fujisan: back to the future
18:25  zer0her0: gah, this song is giving me goosebumps
18:25  zer0her0: in a bad way
18:25  fujisan: http://www.telltalegames.com/bttf
18:26  fujisan: man that apple store love song is so great :O
18:26  fujisan: i could listen to that all day
18:26  fujisan: i guess you guys arent fans like me :)
18:26  fujisan: x~D
18:26  zer0her0: fans of what?
18:26  fujisan: the Apple Store
18:27  zer0her0: i worked at one for a long time ;)
18:27  fujisan: nice female co-workers i heard steve jobs hand picks them D:
18:28  zer0her0: hahaha
18:28  fujisan: or is that just a rumor?
18:28  zer0her0: yea that's def a rumor
18:28  fujisan: or maybe he only does it for the flagship stores
18:28  zer0her0: my main store was almost all male, as was most other stores i worked at, the only exception was larger city stores.
18:28  fujisan: like the London ones Et Cetera
18:29  fujisan: they should hire this Applemilk girl
18:29  fujisan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZjwhdycIvA << here she is
18:29  fujisan: she is amazing
18:30  zer0her0: gah
18:30  fujisan: i mean a girl named applemilk should really work in a flagship store
18:30  zer0her0: she makes me wanna stab my ears w/ pencils
18:30  fujisan: nah she is hawt you have no taste D:
18:32  zer0her0: also, i'm pretty sure she has crack in that cup not coffee
18:32  fujisan: and she made a soft erotic dvd :) with schoolgirl uniforms 
18:32  fujisan: lol zer0her0 
18:32  fujisan: :D
18:32 * zer0her0 facepalms
18:32  fujisan: she has extreme energies  xD
18:33  fujisan: but her vids are in 720p
18:36  dnordstrom: Cool, Linkinus shows YouTube vids directly in the channel window
18:37  rubydiamond: Guys..
18:37  rubydiamond: my cousin is coming back to India from US
18:37  rubydiamond: what should I order from US other than iphone / kindle ?
18:38  zer0her0: one internet to go
18:39  fujisan: bride.ru 
18:42  fujisan: rubydiamond: what do you want from the USA?
18:42  fujisan: you should tell your cousin to get  "Lost" the Tv Show on dvd ;)
18:43  fujisan: rubydiamond:  :) i like spicy food
18:43  fujisan: my neighbor from pakistan made me some roti once you know it?
18:44  fujisan: it was so hot i had flames coming out of my derrière
18:44  fujisan: funny how in English you can utilize the French language for euphemism :D
18:52  _pg_: what could make my ssh connection time out when trying to connecT?
18:53  shuaib: fujisan, you mean the roti was spicy or hot as in heated up?
18:53  Angostura: _pg_: Firewall?
18:53  fujisan: both
18:53  _pg_: Angostura: how can I fix that?
18:53  shuaib: roti isn't supposed to be spicy
18:53  shuaib: unless it wasn't a roti, but some other form of it
18:54  Angostura: _pg_: I just threw out one suggestion for you to check. Without knowing specifics of your set up I don't know how ti fix it
18:54  _pg_: Angostura: isnt the point of ssh to bypass my outoging firewall?
18:55  Angostura: What about the firewall at the other end?
18:55  _pg_: aka tunnel a port
18:55  _pg_: port 22 is open on the server
18:55  Kyle__: Has anyone here successfully installed ubuntu-server 10.10 on a silver imac, where it can still dual-boot to OSX if neccesary?
18:56  Kyle__: The only way I've gotten it to work so far is by blowing away OSX and letting ubuntu use the whole disk
18:56  _pg_: Kyle__: kinda -not server and MBP 4,1 not iMac
18:56  Kyle__: (and even then I got no video).
18:56  Kyle__: _pg_: MBP 4,1?
18:56  Kyle__: Sorry, I must be missing some terminology.
18:57  _pg_: last discrete MBP. with multitouch. before the unibody
18:57  _pg_: 4,1 is the model identifier
18:57  Kyle__: _pg_: Ah I see.  Does that one use EFI?
18:57  _pg_: yup
18:58  Kyle__: _pg_: How are you booting?  The closest dual-boot I've gotten is refit, then mouting sda1 (efi partition) as /boot/efi, then re-installing grub.  And even that doesn't work since I end up in a grub shell with no configuration.
18:59  _pg_: what is the eqiv of fdisk -l in osx? ill send you that
19:01  Kyle__: _pg_: The closest i can come up with is fdisk -d /dev/disc0, but that's not really so useful.
19:01  _pg_: eh
19:01 * Kyle__ sometimes really disagrees with apples decision to go with a bsd userland.
19:02  snL20: Kyle__: you would rather have a dos ?
19:03  Kyle__: snL20: No.  I'd rather have a system that didn't try and fight me with every fiber of it's being.
19:03  Kyle__: (OK, melodrama, I admit.  I've been trying to get these boxes dual booting for a day and a half now)
19:06  _pg_: i have my mbp triple booting with refit
19:06  Kyle__: :(
19:06  _pg_: grub was kind of a bitch but the rest wasnt hard
19:06  Kyle__: _pg_: that seems to be my major sticking point
19:07  _pg_: i thought you said efi was the sticking point
19:07  dnordstrom_: Test test, irssi on Mac :P
19:07  Kyle__: _pg_: it's the root sticking point.  If it wasn't for efi I think this would just boot.  But I could be wrong.  At the moment, if I could get grub working, I'd be happy.
19:08  dnordstrom_: Works pretty well
19:08  snL20: dnordstrom_: omg!
19:08  snL20: :D
19:08  dnordstrom_: Wonder how much resources this would take if I'd run it with screen on my VPS
19:08  Kyle__: _pg_: when you hold down option on boot, does your MBP show you a choice for refit and a choice for OSX, or just the refit choices?
19:08  dnordstrom_: Don't want it to bog down my client production websites
19:09  _pg_: Kyle__: neither.
19:09  dnordstrom_: snL20: Know a lot about irssi?
19:10  _pg_: Kyle__: option gives me osx and bootcamp. refit gives me osx, win7 and ubuntu. win7 and ubuntu both take me to grub. which is annoying but hey it works
19:10  Kyle__: _pg_: OK.  maybe that's what I'm seeing.  But then it's not too far off.
19:10  Kyle__: How/where did you configure your grub?
19:10  snL20: dnordstrom_: some
19:10  dnordstrom_: snL20: Know if it would affect my client websites performances on my VPS if I ran screen and irssi with like 10-15 channels?
19:10  _pg_: Kyle__: i think right in /dev/sda
19:10  snL20: dnordstrom_: I use only irssi on linux
19:11  _pg_: right to the mbr if im not mistaken
19:11  dnordstrom_: snL20: My VPS runs CentOS 5
19:11  Kyle__: _pg_: grub or grub2?
19:11  Kyle__: Oh.  Humm.
19:11  _pg_: Kyle__: grub2 of course
19:11  snL20: dnordstrom_: what kind of bandwith ? although irc doesnt take much
19:12  Kyle__: k, just checking.
19:12  dnordstrom_: snL20: Would be nice to keep connections between reboots etc, but don't want it to take resources from my clients websites
19:12  dnordstrom_: Bankdwidth shouldn't be a problem at all
19:12  dnordstrom_: band*
19:12  snL20: dnordstrom_: well i'm not really in a position to guarantee anything so :)
19:13  dnordstrom_: Hmmm
19:14  snL20: dnordstrom_: I do have about 5 networks and 30 channels open and it doesnt seem to use any mem or cpu at all
19:14  dnordstrom_: Planning to migrate soon to one dev server and one prod server instead of just a production one though
19:15  dnordstrom_: Ah, I'll just try it out for fun :P
19:15  dnordstrom_: I normally don't host for clients anyway so if they don't like the performance, I'll help them get their own hosting...
19:23  dnordstrom: Anyone here really using irssi, or are you guys just using clients with GUIs?
19:26  pgpkeys: Irssi 0.8.15 (20100403) - http://irssi.org/
19:28  dnordstrom: pgpkeys: kk :)
19:35  dnordstrom: brb then, hopefully
19:39 --- kateweb_ is now known as kateweb
19:52  crazyharry: when I do command D in firefox, thebookmark window doesnt come up, I cant bookmark some websites
19:56  S_SubZero: I just tried it on mine and it worked fine.  
19:56 --- Will|override is now known as Will|
19:57  crazyharry: well when I even click on bookmarks and click on bookmark this page nothign happens
19:57  crazyharry: it only can bookmark certain websites
19:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
19:57  S_SubZero: quit out of Firefox, make sure it's not running in activity monitor, and try restarting it
19:58  crazyharry: how can I make sure its not running any activity monitor ?
19:59  S_SubZero: In the upper right corner of the screen there may be an icon representing your hard dirve.
19:59  S_SubZero: Do you see this icon?
19:59 +Tomis: upper right is the spotlight icon in the menubar
19:59  S_SubZero: a little below that
20:00  crazyharry: got it
20:00  S_SubZero: I used to do phone support for old investment bankers.  I can spend 45 minutes telling someone how to click the Start button.  Do not. Push. Me.
20:00 +Tomis: Finder>menu Go>Applications, will take you to the global applications folder
20:01  S_SubZero: double-click the hard drive icon and a new window should appear
20:03  crazyharry: in the activity monitor I see firefox not working
20:03  crazyharry: I mean not running
20:03  S_SubZero: ok
20:04  S_SubZero: start firefox back up
20:04  crazyharry: I did and its still not working
20:04  S_SubZero: we'll make sure you have the current version
20:05  crazyharry: I did help - > update inside firefox
20:05  crazyharry: says no updates avilable
20:05  S_SubZero: what version do you have?
20:05  crazyharry: 3.6.13
20:06  S_SubZero: what you can also do, is just re-download Firefox again and install it over your existing one.  If there's a botched file or something that would overwrite and fix it.
20:06  crazyharry: what is the installer for mac
20:06 +Tomis: wait, so you can start firefox and run the software update check
20:07  crazyharry: is it inside applications ?
20:07 +Tomis: but it's "not working"?
20:07  crazyharry: yes Tomis
20:07 +Tomis: so what happens when you try to open a browser window
20:07  crazyharry: it updates some pages
20:07 +Tomis: or go to a website
20:07  crazyharry: but not most
20:07  crazyharry: it opens everything well
20:07  crazyharry: everything wrokign fine
20:07 +Tomis: then what's the problem?
20:07  crazyharry: I just cant bookmark any new websites
20:08  crazyharry: when I click on bookmark or bookmark this page or command-D nothng happens
20:08  crazyharry: S_SubZero, whats the package installer for Mac
20:08 +Tomis: trash the prefs, go download firefox again
20:08 +Tomis: for firefox, there is no package installer
20:08 +Tomis: you just get the straight app, thankfully
20:08  S_SubZero: what you want to do is go to the website:  http://www.firefox.com
20:09 --- dnordstrom is now known as dnordstrom|away
20:12  S_SubZero: package installer?
20:12 +Tomis: yea, like .pkg
20:12 +Tomis: or he may be thinking of the way linux handles app installs with "packages"
20:12  S_SubZero: OS X is designed so a soccer mom can use it.  What does a soccer mom know about .pkg files
20:12  S_SubZero: (hint: nothing)
20:12  pgpkeys: hint depends on the soccor mom ;)
20:13  zer0her0: S_SubZero: um huh?
20:13  atmosx: hint: computers are not retards in first place
20:13  atmosx: get an iPad for that
20:13  S_SubZero: no I'd say computers are retards.
20:13  atmosx: I'm off
20:14  atmosx: yes they are
20:14 +Tomis: they only do what you tell them to
20:14  atmosx: but are not supposed to be used by retards
20:14 +Tomis: sure they are
20:14  atmosx: depends on your definition of a retard
20:14 +Tomis: they should be designed to be simple obvious tools
20:14  pgpkeys: computers ARE retards. they can only do what we humans program them to do
20:14  S_SubZero: one of the main reasons computers exist at all is because people a long time ago decided "MATH IS HARRRD"
20:14  atmosx: a guy the other day called Julian Assange a computer lamer
20:14 +Tomis: not these overly complex messes
20:14  atmosx: I think he is pretty skilled
20:15  atmosx: but if you are say, Schneir, you might think he is not (skilled)
20:15 --- kateweb_ is now known as kateweb
20:15  atmosx: Tomis: obvious... yes... by what measure?
20:15  atmosx: is iTunes obvious? 'cause my mother can't use it
20:15 +Tomis: if a 4 year old can use it, it's good
20:16 +Tomis: if they can't you made it too complex, start over
20:16  atmosx: a 4 year old has much more patient that my father
20:16  crazyharry: when I dragged the new file to the Application it didnt install the Firefox but copied a disk image called Firefox 3.6.13.dmg, and after I clicked on it, it gave me the old firefox and the bookmark doesnt work either
20:16  atmosx: hmmm ok
20:16 +Tomis: yea, they need to get rid of dmg, i hate those
20:16 +Tomis: open the DMG, copy the firefox application out of it crazyharry 
20:17 +Tomis: the DMG is just an archive containing the application, it's a "virtual disk image"
20:17 +Tomis: it will mount on your machine like a disk
20:17 +Tomis: you copy the app out, then "eject" the virtual disk
20:17 +Tomis: then you can throw the DMG away
20:17  crazyharry: when I clcik on dmg it shows two option, the firefox on the left and a folder on the right
20:17 +Tomis: yup
20:17  S_SubZero: doesn't the DMG have two giant icons, one with FF and one with Applications, with a HUGE arrow?
20:17  crazyharry: which one I should click on ?
20:17  crazyharry: right
20:17  S_SubZero: It's not a complicated process
20:17 +Tomis: drag the firefox icon to the applications folder
20:17 +Tomis: it will copy it over
20:17  crazyharry: sorry forever windows user, new to mac
20:18 +Tomis: except that is *is* a complicated proces S_SubZero 
20:18  S_SubZero: I used Windows forever too, but I figured out the install process pretty quick.  "It seems to want me to drag this over here.."
20:18 +Tomis: i've dealt with this DMG issue far too many times
20:18 +Tomis: it *should* be, application.app.zip
20:18 +Tomis: download this zip'd app, it extracts the app, chucks the zip, done
20:19  crazyharry: ok but why does the date modified shows shows dec 3 
20:19 +Tomis: there's your app, put it where you want, if you want to get fancy, safari should ask you if you want to "instal" it, ie, move it to the apps folder
20:19 +Tomis: because that's when the application was made crazyharry ?
20:19  crazyharry: after installing the new firefox
20:19  crazyharry: ok
20:19  crazyharry: now I can delete the dmg file ?
20:20 +Tomis: after you've coppied the app out of it? yes
20:20 +Tomis: make sure you eject it first though! otherwise it won't let you delete the DMG
20:21  crazyharry: nothing changed
20:21  crazyharry: looks like the bookmark window comes up only I am trying to save old bookmarks
20:21 +Tomis: be more descriptive
20:22  crazyharry: when i goto a new website and click Bookmarks
20:22  crazyharry: nothing happens
20:22 +Tomis: then try trashing the preferences
20:22 +Tomis: ~/library/preferences/com.mozilla.firefox or something like that
20:23 +Tomis: maybe check the profiles crap too, in ~/library/application support/mozilla
20:23  crazyharry: can I go firefox - > preferences - > general ?
20:23  zer0her0: yea .dmg are the most backwards thing about apple
20:24 +Tomis: to do what crazyharry 
20:25 +Tomis: i'm talking about deleting the prefs because who knows what hidden setting or whathave you is mucked, so try wiping those settings out
20:25  crazyharry: ok I am inside Library/Preferences
20:25  crazyharry: see no more directories
20:25  crazyharry: only files
20:25 +Tomis: ah huh
20:26  crazyharry: see some but nothing called application support
20:26 +Tomis: application support is in library, not preferences
20:26 +Tomis: ~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist
20:27 +Tomis: is the firefox preferences
20:27  crazyharry: ok
20:27  crazyharry: so I can see /Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist
20:27  crazyharry: should I delete it ?
20:28 +Tomis:  ~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla and ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox are the profiles
20:28 +Tomis: yea, move 'em to the trash, or a temp folder somewhere
20:29  crazyharry: ok I renamed the filename to  /Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist1
20:30  crazyharry: should I change the /Library/Application Support/Firefox too ?
20:30 +Tomis: i would just move it, and yes
20:30  crazyharry: I have 3 files
20:30  crazyharry: Profiles
20:30  crazyharry: profiles.ini
20:30  crazyharry: which one
20:30 +Tomis: that whole folder
20:31  crazyharry: will this remove all my bookmarks ?
20:31 +Tomis: probably
20:31 +Tomis: just move said bookmarks files back later
20:31 +Tomis: first you wanna see if it's being stupid because of a config file, or if the app its self is just borked up
20:33  crazyharry: ok removed
20:33  crazyharry: now should I start firefox again ?
20:33 +Tomis: yup yup

21:41  Angostura: But if nothing changes in that hour, the delta file size is zero - so ... ?
21:41 +Tomis: you can't change the timeframe pgpkeys 
21:41  pgpkeys: hehe dude, stuff changes all the time
21:41 +Tomis: you're given when you're given, and you will like it
21:42 +Tomis: want less detailed backups? disconnect from the backup drive
21:42  pgpkeys: damn, not very friendly but ok
21:42 +Tomis: it's set it and forget it
21:42 +Tomis: get a backup drive that is 1.5 to 2x the size of your boot drive, and you're good to go
