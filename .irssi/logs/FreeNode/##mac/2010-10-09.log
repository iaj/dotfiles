19:17  Ballresin: Anybody have wifi problems with iPad?
19:23  LordHawke: Okay.
19:23  LordHawke: So.
19:24  LordHawke: I'm trying to change DiskImageMounter's default icon for ISO and CD/DVD Master Images to a custom icon with a picture of a CD instead of a Hard Disk.
19:24  LordHawke: I labeled it diskcopy-cd.icns. I changed the value for the image file in the info.plist file. The icons don't change.
19:24  LordHawke: What do?

21:11  aum: i know nothing about osx (I'm a linux guy) - with mac OSX laptops, what filesystem is used for the hard disk, and what connection standard is the HDD (IDE, SCSI, SATA etc)?
21:12 --- cdbob_ is now known as cdbob
21:17  S_SubZero: HFS+
21:17  S_SubZero: the Intel Macs use SATA
21:18  danl: S_SubZero: could be HFS or HFS+ ;)
21:19  S_SubZero: you can buy a Mac at the Apple Store today that uses regular HFS for the hard disk?
21:22  danl: No, but you can reinstall OS X using HFS ;)
21:23  S_SubZero: I'm assuming a "linux guy that knows nothing about OS X" hasn't reinstalled it.
21:24  S_SubZero: I also didn't think it would be prudent to nitpick tiny things with a new user.
21:25  danl: :D I'm just bored, waiting on my iPad to sync, ignore me.
21:25  danl: I will go back to reading the Dhammapada

22:34  WarpZone: Or DMG it?
22:35 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 69 seconds
22:35  Tomis: archive it by right-clicking it in the finder and choose "archive"
22:35  Tomis: once it' archived, delete the app
22:35  salamandyr: anyone have an opinion how much performance diff 1060 v. 1333 hz RAM support in an i7 qc imac would make?  
22:35  Tomis: if you need more frequent access to it, then you want to use a DMG. open disk utility, go to File>New>From folder
22:35  Tomis: get what the machine supports salamandyr 
22:36  salamandyr: Tomis - i'm trying to choose between 2 machines, actually, with diff ram speed support.
22:36  WarpZone: "archive" is not an option.  How do I DMG it.
22:36  Tomis: well you're talking about a 20% speed increase in terms of the raw speed
22:36  Tomis: but i don't know what that translates into in rea-world performance
22:37  WarpZone: "Compress" is.  I'm zipping it.
22:37  Tomis: especially since, between machines there are going to be a number of other factors at play
22:37  salamandyr: right.. i dunno if the late spring 1060hz i7 imacs will perform any less than the newer 1333 ones now.. or if the faster ram bus is just marketing
22:38  WarpZone: Thanks Tomis.
22:38  Tomis: it's faster, then it's faster
22:38  Tomis: how much faster? find some benchmarks, then find some real-world tests
22:38  salamandyr: unless that's the only difference, and i dunno if the i7 can really take advantage of the faster bus
22:39  Tomis: sure it can
22:39  Tomis: a faster system bus is always a good thing
22:39  salamandyr: well, the ram speed is different - i couldn't find any specs on front side bus
22:41  salamandyr: oh huh.. looks like i've got to choose between a 1066 fsb i7 and a 1333 fsb i5.  :)
22:41  salamandyr: even less clear
22:42  salamandyr: same cpu speed in both
22:43 --- cdbob_ is now known as cdbob
22:44  S_SubZero: where are the processor specs for the iMacs you're looking at?
22:44  Tomis: what? they put slower ram on a faster CPU?
22:44  Tomis: that makes no sense
22:45  salamandyr: ya, late spring quad i7 2.8 with 1060mhz fsb/ram versus a current i5 quad 2.8 with 1333 fsb/ram
22:48  salamandyr: see my dilemma?  :)
22:54  S_SubZero: I'm not familiar with the processors in the iMacs.

22:58  cdbob_: Ha, I got civ 5 to work on my mac using wine
22:58  koro: Congratulations. Go play now
23:00  cdbob_: I am, it's called multi monitor :D
23:01  koro: How's the performance?
23:01  cdbob_: Not sure yet
23:01 --- cdbob_ is now known as cdbob
23:04  cdbob: It's not too bad
23:05  cdbob: Keep in mind this is being played on a unibody macbook with a core 2 2 GHZ, 4 gigs of ram, a 5400rpm hdd and a 9400m
23:06  koro: same as mine
23:06  koro: "not too bad"?
23:06  koro: wait what size macbook?
23:12  cdbob: 13"
