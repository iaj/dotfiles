10:33  iaj: lo someone up?
10:35  iaj: http://pastebin.com/xRZ172aV  can someone tell me how I could fix that/
10:42  Branes: 1) stop using ZFS, OSX doesn't like it, 2) stop tinkering with Apple-installed files, 3) go ask programming questions in #macdev
10:55  iaj: ZFS ? 
10:56  remyobuntu: iaj: It's a filesystem
11:45  richardcavell: Mac hardware is becoming increasingly relatively expensive.  Macs haven't dropped in price recently, while the price of PCs continues to fall.
11:45  richardcavell: The cheapest MacBook Pro is $1499 AUS
11:45  richardcavell: That's the most expensive HP laptop available at JB HiFi
11:48  bonhoffer: anyone familiar with parallels for Mac -- it looks like i lost all my data and am looking for options
11:48  freeloader: Hello, I'm getting "Undefined symbols: _KCFRunLoopCommonModes", wheni try to compile one of my projects... what should I link to?
12:46  richardcavell: Hi everyone.  I was talking about the expense of mac hardware before and I didn't stick around for the replies
12:47  richardcavell: I'm lamenting the fact that PC hardware is increasingly cheap while Mac hardware costs haven't shifted for at least 6 months
12:48  richardcavell: I mean, $1000 AUS gets me a nniiiiiiicceee PC
12:48  richardcavell: That doesn't even get me into the Apple store
12:52  richardcavell: Mac hardware should be competitive on some level
12:52  richardcavell: I mean, I love Apple and want to stay with it, but I'm just throwing money away if I do
12:52  richardcavell: My next purchase is going to be a Windows machine
12:52  richardcavell: has to be
12:53  richardcavell: otherwise I'm throwing away a thousand bucks at least
12:53  b3ny0-: I don't
12:53  b3ny0-: but they make nice computers
13:16  Angostura: richardcavell: Gets you a nice PC with a nice screen and a Web cam and ...Mac OS X?
13:24  richardcavell: Angostura: rather have Linux
13:25  richardcavell: I don't want a hackintosh
13:25  richardcavell: I'll keep this MacBook
13:26  Angostura: richardcavell: So if you would prefer Linux and there are lots of good cheap machines out there, why on earth are you worried about the price of Macs?
13:26  richardcavell: I mean gee I could get a dedicated Linux computer for a few hundred bucks
13:26  richardcavell: No I'd prefer a Mac to a Linux PC but I'd prefer Linux to a hackintosh
13:27  Angostura: But you said (a) you preferred Linux and (b) that "$1000 AUS gets me a nniiiiiiicceee PC"
13:27  Angostura: So you're all set
13:27  richardcavell: well yeah
13:28  richardcavell: I mean, I'd rather spend $1000 on a Linux PC that's loaded up than spend $2000 on a Mac with ordinary tech
13:28  Angostura: So you're all set, there is no problem. 
13:29  richardcavell: I guess so
13:30  Angostura: The hardware costs of a Mac go in to cross-subsidising OS X development
13:30  Angostura: and providing decent customer support
13:32  iTruc: how to hide an app on the dock ?
13:32  iTruc: when it is launched ?
13:33  ichdertom: command-h
13:35  Angostura: You mean so it doesn't appear in the Dock?
13:37  bonhoffer: anyone familiar with parallels for mac?
13:38  Branes: bon, have you search or posted to the parallels user-forums yet?
13:40  richardcavell: OS X development doesn't cost that much
13:40  richardcavell: I mean, Windows 7 costs about a hundred bucks per end user
13:40  richardcavell: No I'm convinced that Mac is lagging too far behind in hardware
13:41  richardcavell: I just can't justify buying a Mac any more.  It wasn't that way a few years ago
13:41  richardcavell: When they were PowerPC they were a bit behind, but still comparable
13:41  richardcavell: Now there's just no comparison
13:41  Branes: OS development is a HUGE cost.
13:42  Branes: And Apple don't sell hardware.
13:42  richardcavell: What do you mean they don't sell hardware?
13:42  Branes: They don't sell hardware.
13:42  Branes: They sell solutions.
13:42  richardcavell: I still don't think OS X development would be more than 200 bucks per user
13:42  richardcavell: the range of hardware with which it needs to be compatible is far less than Windows
13:43  Branes: With nearly two thousand programming staff, that's a huge amount in salaries.
13:43  richardcavell: They've got 2000 people fulltime coding OS X?
13:43  richardcavell: Are you serious?
13:43  Branes: Yep.
13:43  Branes: 800 in CoreOS alone.
13:43  richardcavell: What the hell do they do all day?
13:44  Branes: 1IL is the size of a suburb.
13:44  Branes: Avoid Steve, usually :)
13:44  richardcavell: I don't feel as though my Snow Leopard installation has had 2000 fulltime employees working on it
13:45  richardcavell: since it was released it's had a few updates
13:45  Branes: It's the truth, though.
13:45  richardcavell: but so have various Linux tools that are worked on by one guy in his spare time
13:45  Branes: Nevertheless, the only thing Apple sells, is the OS.
13:45  richardcavell: Maybe they're building OS 11?
13:45  Branes: For the price, they include thenecessary dongle to run it.
13:46  Branes: There will be no OS 11.
13:46  richardcavell: You're being silly.  The price of a new computer is mostly hardware
13:46  Branes: 10.7 will be the last in the OSX series.
13:46  Branes: No it isn't.
13:46  richardcavell: And the point that I'm making is that there is a huge gap between Mac and PC
13:47  richardcavell: Is there anything known about 10.7?
13:47  Branes: Yes, because the PC doesn't come with an OS.
13:47  richardcavell: Or OS 11?
13:47 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
13:47  Branes: 10.7 will be formally announced on the 20th.
13:47  richardcavell: You can get an OEM Windows for a damn sight less than the gap between PC and Mac
13:47  Branes: It will have its two years in the field, then 'the king' will be deposed, and iOS Desktop will be the next standard.
13:48  richardcavell: I'll get Windows 7 on my next machine so I can play games
13:48  richardcavell: anything known yet about 10.7?  Where can they go with it?
13:48  Branes: You can get good BMW leather seats for a Lada too :)
13:48  richardcavell: Snow Leopard looks as good as OS X can get to me

13:50  Branes: A 15-inch basic-spec C2D Compaq costs approximately US$180 in parts, a MacBook Pro with almost the same specs, almost US$200, the bulk of the difference is the laser-milled unibody casing made by Foxconn.

18:27  Marvolo: nor is it in mine, but spotlight is still in the menubar
18:27  Marvolo: you may  need to look in a different location
18:28  Marvolo: Caveat: I don't know anything
18:28  Cam: I took it out earlier.. but I need to see how my reindex is doing..
18:29  ichdertom: how did you remove spotlight?
18:29  Angostura: I was about to ask too
18:30  Cam: ichdertom; cmd + drag off the menubar.
18:30  Cam: And I want it back, http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=440866 says it should be where I looked..
18:31  ichdertom: Cam: doesn't work with spotlight
18:31  Cam: ichdertom; Yeah it does.
18:31  ichdertom: not on my mac
18:31  Cam: Hm..
18:31  Cam: I have no idea then :D
18:31  Cam: I just want it bacl..
18:31  Cam: Can you upload me your copy ichdertom?
18:31  Cam: mediafire.com?
18:32  ichdertom: my copy of what
18:32  Cam: Spotlight.app in /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app
18:32  Angostura: It's impossible to drag the spotlight icon off the menubar
18:32  Marvolo: and that doesn't exist Cam, at least for me.
18:32  ichdertom: lol you think if i upload my spotlight app the icon will come back?
18:32  Angostura: Even if it were, that would not remove the executable
18:32  Cam: Marvolo; me neither..
18:32  Cam: ichdertom; if I run it as a startup.
18:32  ichdertom: lol
18:33  Cam: FFFFFF
18:33  ichdertom: what do you use?
18:33  ichdertom: snow leopard?
18:33  ichdertom: 64 bit?
18:33  Angostura: Cam: What happens when you select Spotlight in System Preferences?
18:33  Cam: Yeah.
18:33  Cam: Angostura; http://cl.ly/04e8c1425fafb66d745f
18:34  stuckey: hi all
18:34  Angostura: Cam: I would try restarting your box
18:34  ichdertom: Cam: there is no spotlight.app in coreservices
18:34  Cam: Angostura; >.<
18:34  Cam: ichdertom; http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2007103015513360
18:35  Cam: AH! Maybe etc/hostconfig..
18:35  stuckey: i have a machine that's logged in automatically at boot, but I don't know the admin password (it logs into admin automaticall) -- is there anyway to recover the password? 
18:35  Cam: stuckey; put in the install disk.
18:35  stuckey: i'm on 10.6.4
18:35  ichdertom: tombook-2:~ ichdertom$ ls /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app
18:35  ichdertom: ls: /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app: No such file or directory
18:35  stuckey: don't have the disk
18:36  Cam: stuckey; you're screwed.
18:36  Angostura: Cam: Well that's clearly not where 10.6 puts it - because it isn't there
18:36  Cam: Angostura; ok... that's why I am here.
18:36  Marvolo: It's somewhere else he means. 
18:37  Cam: If I could solve this I wouldn't be here... well, i still would be here, but I would be idling.
18:37  Marvolo: It doesn't belong in Coreservices
18:37 * Cam guesses
18:37  Cam: Could it be Search.bundle in said folder.
18:39  Cam: Angostura; I might've used onyx.. let me try and redownlo;ad that.
18:39  Cam: Also, my icons aren't showing up correctly on my computer in cmd+tab, how di I fix that?
18:40  Marvolo: Search.bundle does seem to have the proper files for Spotlight
18:40  Cam: Marvolo; yeah..
18:40  Marvolo: Just a confirmation
18:41  Angostura: Just to let you know FindAnyFile finds no Occurences of Spotlight.app
18:42  ichdertom: Cam:  http://www.pageya.com/Contents.zip put this into Search.bundle in /System/Library/CoreServices
18:42  ichdertom: and tell me when i can delete it
18:44  Marvolo: Cam brings up a curious point about command+tab. what is the process that it runs under?
18:44  Marvolo: i don't know how else to phrase taht
18:44  Angostura: Finder, I presume
18:44  ichdertom: maybe it's best to reinstall
18:45  Angostura: Cam: Have you actually  tried to restart the machine yet?

18:48  alexbobP: the keyboard on my mbp seems to mysteriously stop working every once in a while, when I have a java app minimized
18:48  alexbobP: first it slows down so that characters show up a bit after I type them, and the it just stops working, not even caps lock works
18:48  hvgotcodes: what type of SSD goes into the current MBP?
18:48  hvgotcodes: specifically the 512GB one?
18:49  Marvolo: what an onslaught 
18:50  Branes: hvgotcodes: The spares SSD we have for current non-Air MacBooks is a Samsung. I forget the part number, though.
18:50  Branes: hvgotcodes: The one for the MacBook Air is a Toshiba.
18:50  Cam: BACK!
18:50  Cam: Angostura; have I actually what?
18:50  Cam: ichdertom; downloading..
18:50  Cam: Marvolo; I have no idea.
18:51  ichdertom: Cam: can i delete it now?
18:51  hvgotcodes: Branes: even the 512GB one?
18:51  Cam: ichdertom; I am not reinstalling.
18:52  Branes: hvgotcodes: yup
18:52  Cam: ichdertom; no. http://cl.ly/1348687eed143eebf99e
18:52  Cam: Look at that :( Stupid school internet.
18:52  Branes: Nothing special.
18:52  ichdertom: Cam: lol
18:52  ichdertom: wtf
18:52  ichdertom: restart the download
18:52  Cam: Everyone is getting on right now and 70% speed is still dedicated to academic wifi. Not dorm wifi.
18:52  alexbobP: 512GB SSD?  holy crap
18:52  alexbobP: how much does something like that cost?
18:52  Cam: ichdertom; It is my internet.
18:53  ichdertom: Cam: are you serious?
18:53  hvgotcodes: branes hmm cant find it online
18:53  Cam: ichdertom; Like I said, today is a special day, internet gets passed to dorms at 2:00 with 10mb/s but right now all of it is in the academic sector.
18:53  Cam: They ITG dept. here is inept.
18:53  Angostura: Cam: Have you acually restarted your machine?
18:54  Cam: Angostura; since we've been talking? No.
18:54  Cam: Ever? Yes.
18:54  Angostura: Since your Spotlight icon disapeared?
18:54  Marvolo: In the relevant timeframe of your apparent Spotlight problemo?
18:54  Cam: Angostura; Definitely
18:54  Cam: I restarted about 1 day ago, it's been this way for < 2 months
18:55  Angostura:  And in all user accounts?
18:55  Marvolo: have you rerouted all power from the auxiliary power source?
18:55  Cam: Marvolo; Hm?
18:55  Cam: Angostura; I don't know.
18:55  Angostura: and remodulated the shield frequencies?
18:55 * Cam has no idea what is being said.
18:55  ichdertom: lol
18:55  Angostura: Cam: Create a new test account, see if Spotlight is there
18:56  Angostura: If not, reinstall the OS
18:56  Cam: That involves closing IRC.
18:56  Cam: Angostura; I am not reinstalling.
18:56  ichdertom: reinstall your machine and see if spotlight is there :D
18:56  Cam: I always win. ichdertom I have tried
18:56  Angostura: Cam: Why no reinstall?
18:56  Cam: Logging into Admin = Closing IRC. Reinstalling = Accepting that I can't do it. Restarting = 0 uptime.
18:57  Cam: ichdertom; delete it.
18:57  ichdertom: ok
18:57  Cam: Thanks BTW
18:57  ichdertom: Cam: after you copied it to the desired location you'll have to restart anyway
18:57  Angostura: If you've screwed up your OS installation in some way you can't define then an OS reinstall will take 30 minutes of your time, as opposed to 40 minutes on IRC not solving the problem
18:57  Cam: Angostura; fine with me :D
18:58  Angostura: OK, well I'm done with you
18:58  Cam: :(
19:00  Branes: Cam: Install AppleJack. Restart into single user mode, once all the text has stopped type 'applejack AUTO restart' and let it do its thing, it will restart when finished and boot normally.
19:00  NullMoogleLaptop: hello
19:00  Branes: See if that fixes things.
19:00  Branes: If it does not, a re-install of the OS is your only remaining option.
19:00  alexbobP: Branes: do you know anything about an issue with os x that can cause the keybord to stop responding?
19:00  alexbobP: the mouse and everything else still works!
19:00  Cam: Branes; I have an idae.
19:00  Marvolo: alexbobP i dont know too much about java but it seems that the java app is capturing the input and not letting go
19:01  Cam: *Idea
19:01  Marvolo: take a look at the java app you're running
19:01  Branes: alexbobP: A few; could be the firmware in the keyboard (it is a USB device), could be the cable, could be the electronics in the keyboard itself.
19:01  NullMoogleLaptop: Do i have the ability to sue powermax? I placed an order and they canceled it :(
19:01  NullMoogleLaptop: http://wtfmoogle.com/?attachment_id=1598
19:01  NullMoogleLaptop: http://wtfmoogle.com/?attachment_id=1599
19:01  Branes: alexbobP: Next time the keyboard stops responding, use the mouse to open System Profiler and see if the keyboard is still listed.
19:01  alexbobP: Marvolo: that would make sense, if the problem didn't persist even after quitting the java app and logging out :P
19:01  Cam: Branes; I got it bacl.
19:01  alexbobP: also a usb keyboard works.
19:02  Marvolo: can you use the keyboard after log out? eg the login screen?
19:02  Cam: Branes; ichdertom Angostura Marvolo http://cl.ly/440dc3e06bb0918de215
19:02  Marvolo: there may be a helper application that doesnt close with the Java app.
19:02  alexbobP: Branes: it's not working now.  where do I find system profiler?
19:02  Branes: Cam: I still recommend you install AppleJack and use it to clean your caches and perform maintenance tasks that may have been missed.
19:02  Cam: Branes; will that fix my icons?
19:02  Branes: alexbobP: /Applications/Utilities
19:02  Branes: Cam: It is possible, yes.
19:02  Cam: Branes; http://cl.ly/3452dcaf2b0dc0efe6d8
19:03  NullMoogleLaptop: has anyone ever had anything like that before?
19:03  Cam: See that blank icon?
19:03  Angostura: Cam: And you got it back, how?
19:03  CPng|N: click the Apple, hold option
19:03  Cam: Angostura; Onyx.
19:03  alexbobP: holy crap
19:03  alexbobP: Branes: I was messing with the touchpad on the laptop... it wasn't working at first but then the mouse moved
19:03  Angostura: The pope shits in the woods?
19:04  alexbobP: Branes: and after that the keyboard worked again
19:04  Cam: Does anyone know how to fix http://cl.ly/3452dcaf2b0dc0efe6d8?
19:05  Branes: Cam: AppleJack will clear icon caches, it has a good chance of correcting it.
19:05  Cam: Branes; Okay.
19:05  NullMoogleLaptop: do you need to be +i to chat here?
19:05  Cam: NullMoogleLaptop; No.
19:05  Branes: NullMoogleLaptop: nope
19:05  Cam: +i is not a user mode, it is a channel mode.
19:06  Branes: If you get snarky or abusive, the ops will +q you, you can see what we type but you will be muted.
19:06 * Cam has had that treatment before :D
19:06  NullMoogleLaptop: so did anyone see my 2 links?
19:06  torchie_pre: :o
19:06  Marvolo: we were preoccupied
19:06  Cam: NullMoogleLaptop; Yes, don't sue.
19:07  Cam: If they canceled and you get your money it is fine.
19:07  NullMoogleLaptop: i want my 0$ mac lol
19:07  Cam: Be back later.
19:07  Cam: NullMoogleLaptop; >.<
19:07  Cam: inb4 they send you a MacMini :)
19:08  Cam: Branes; I click "Install" on AppleJacks installer and it clicks but doesn't install
19:08  alexbobP: NullMoogleLaptop: I think you have to have claim to a minimum of $50 to sue somebody
19:08  alexbobP: NullMoogleLaptop: so good luck taking them to court for $0
19:10  Angostura: NullMoogleLaptop: It would appear that the first e-mail is an explicit message saying "this is not an order or a binding contract, it is subject to manual review"
19:10  NullMoogleLaptop: aww
19:11  Angostura: They describe what you have as a "submission"
