16:31  RichardLynch: I'm running MS Outlook 2011 for work email, which is way better than Entourage or VMWare + Doze + Outlook, but...  The OS keeps asking me "Microsoft Outlook wants to user your confidential information stored in "Exchange" in your keychain" and I don't want my email password stored anywhere, thank you very much.  There's no "Deny Always" button.  How do I convince it to quit asking me to store my password in the keychain?

21:22  rorx: antlong: If you mean using those kinds of rc scripts, no. As of v10.4, OSX uses launchd(8) for that purpose.
21:22  antlong: rorx, hmn, im essentially just looking to alias things like 'run something'
21:23  antlong: rorx, i guess i can alias run, then alias something
21:23  dimm: i put config.ovpn to Sample Config Dir, then rename with clinet.tblk  but tunnelblik not see config after run
21:23  rorx: antlong: well, the launchd recipe would replace the whatever script.
21:23  rorx: -the
21:24  antlong: rorx, what if its not an actual background process or such? like 'run nano'
21:25  rorx: antlong: hmm, I put that in a .command file and add it to your accounts' login items. This will start Terminal.app at login and run the commands in the .command file.
21:25  dimm: help help help
21:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraX]
21:25  dimm: stupid openvpn not want work
21:26  antlong: rorx, my use is trivial, but its for on demand kind of things. like running a jar file, or such
21:26  antlong: rorx, running a test suite, things like that
21:27  rorx: antlong: yeah but it sounds like something that would run as you, so if it's a background process, you can still use launchd that run as you, or if it's interactive, adding it to the Login Items, like I mentioned above.
21:30  antlong: rorx, ill look in to launchd, ty :)
21:31  Angostura: antlong: Google 'Lingon' while you are at it - it may save some time
21:31  rorx: antlong: take a look at launchd.plist(5) for the explanation of the format/syntax of the launchd configuration files.
21:32  antlong: Angostura, theres absolutely no text that says what it does :)
21:32  Acoon: Is it possible for an iMac to perform a remote install
21:32  Acoon: got the snow leopard in my mac book, but can't seem to get the remote install to work
21:33  Angostura: antlong: Ah yes - that's a bit of a bummer. Try this http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/19879/lingon
21:33  dimm: is it possible that openvpn on mac is working?
21:33  antlong: Angostura, nice ty. only 10.5?
21:34  Angostura: Works with Snow Leopard, as far as I know
21:34  dimm: openvpn work with snow leo?
21:34  Angostura: ... well, it works for me
21:34  dimm: but not work for me
21:34  Angostura: dimm: talking to antlong 
21:35  dimm: antlong: Angostura sayed that i can talk with you, can you help me please with openvpn ?
21:35  antlong: lol
21:36  dimm: can somebody work with openvpn?
21:36  Angostura: dimm: No, I was talking to antlong about his problem
21:36  antlong: dimm, try viscosity 
21:36  rorx: dimm: that depends on whether or not tap & tun drivers work in 10.6.

21:37  Cam: Hey guys, if I reinstall on my computer... will my iphone not be able to sync to the new itunes?
21:38  Cam: Or should I copy a file so that iTunes recognizes my phone?
21:39  antlong: Cam, just sign back in to itunes
21:39  Angostura: If you reinstall what?
21:39  Cam: Angostura; OSX.
21:40  Cam: I am going to reformat my HD and reinstall..
21:40  dimm: 2010-12-02 23:39:40 *Tunnelblick: openvpnstart status #236: Unable to find configuration file in (null)
21:40  dimm: it is from Details from tunnelblick
21:40  Angostura: But you're going to backup and then restore your user data, right?
21:40  Cam: Angostura; No, I have saved the files I want on a USB. I am deleting all else.
21:41  Cam: I don't want the shit on this thing.
21:41  Angostura: You're backing up the iTunes library?
21:42  Cam: Yes, but I am not going to drag it into my ~/music.
21:42  Cam: I am just going to drag 50-100 songs off of it.. not the itunes.db
21:43  Cam: Let's just say that I am not going to back it up, for simplicity's sake. 
21:43  Cam: How would I make sure that iTunes would recognize my iPhone?
21:44  Angostura: Personally, I would run iTunes, delete all the crupt you don't want from within iTunes then drag the library to backup
21:45  Angostura: s/crupt/cruft/
21:45  Cam: I need another option
21:45  Angostura: Why so?
21:45  Cam: >.>
21:45  Cam: Fine.
21:46  Angostura: The precise answer to your question is "I don't know". I am trying to provide yo with a workaround to prevent dataloss. 
21:46  Cam: Ok.
21:47  Cam: I will try your method I guess.
21:47  Cam: Thanks Angostura 
21:47  Angostura: whoops
21:47  Cam: Err....??? I said: 15:47 < Cam> I will try your method I guess.
21:48  Angostura: OK
21:48  Cam: Thanks!
21:54  antlong: Angostura, is there an option to run when i use a command? (with lingon) i dont see anything like that
21:54  antlong: or do i need to stick ot using lingon's gui
21:54  Cam: antlong; For what?
21:55  fujisan: Any solutions to emptying the trash without causing a kernel panic?
21:55  Cam: Ok... time to restore. Peace.
21:55  fujisan: :<
21:55  Cam: fujisan; open terminal.
21:56  Cam: Let me know when you've done that?
21:56  dimm: when i 'telnet SERVER 1194'
21:56  fujisan: ye done
21:56  dimm: i can see log in tcpdump
21:56  Cam: fujisan; cd ~   <enter>    rm -rf .Trash <enter>
21:56  dimm: but when i try to connect via tunnelblick, or via viscosity i see nothing in tcpdump
21:57  fujisan: rm: illegal option -- .
21:57  fujisan: usage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ...
21:57  fujisan:        unlink file
21:57  fujisan: :<
21:57  Cam: fujisan; .........
21:57  fujisan: should i use sudo?
21:57  Cam: type 'rm -rf ~/.Trash' in terminal.
21:57  Cam: Nope.
21:58  fujisan: nothing appears to be happening
21:58  Cam: Is the trash closed?
21:58  Cam: Did the command run?
21:59  fujisan: no clue but the trashcan is still full
21:59  dimm: stupid mac world
21:59  Cam: fujisan; http://cl.ly/0O0f2r3w1E0L2E2M0N2M - that's what it should look like...
21:59  Cam: fujisan; Ok. Open the trash, select an item, hit cmd+i and tell me the path
22:00  Cam: The info window is like: http://cl.ly/3A3o3M1V1Z0n0j0H2Y14 - > give me this http://cl.ly/3Z2N0F1h1k0a1t3C1A17
22:00  fujisan:  /Volumes/LaCie/.Trashes/501
22:00  Cam: Ah ok.
22:00  Cam: So you're trying to delete something off of an external :)
22:01  Cam: Type "rm -rf /Volumes/LaCie/.Trashes/" :)
22:01  fujisan: it ends up in the mac os x trashcan
22:01  fujisan: thanks
22:01  Cam: fujisan; I know.
22:01  Cam: Let me know how that works out
22:01  fujisan: now it says permission denied :<
22:02  Cam: Type "sudo rm -rf /Volumes/LaCie/.Trashes/" :)
22:03  Cam: Then close your terminal window and re-open it. So sudo rights get disabled. You don't want sudo sitting on a terminal window... lest something happens.
