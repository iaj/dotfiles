08:54  joakimk: [##java] Hi! I'm using librxtxSerial.jnilib (from rxtx.qbang.org) to access serial ports in Java. I have a small test program which lists all ports. This works fine in Linux, but on my Mac (10.6) it doesn't seem to "see" the USB-serial cable I've attached. In Lin
08:54  joakimk: In Linux, this is listed as /dev/ttyUSB0
08:56  joakimk: I can verify that the cable is indeed "active" in the os, by looking in the System Profiler.
08:58  joakimk: My program only lists 4 ports; /dev/tty.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync, /dev/cu.Bluetooth-PDA-Sync, /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Modem, and /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Modem

09:04  joakimk: Hm.. Could it be that the cable/converter is not mounted?
09:05  joakimk: I can't see it in /dev/
09:12  joakimk: "ls -l /dev | wc -l" gives 304. If I unplug the cable (and see that it disappears from System Profiler), "ls -l /dev | wc -l" *still* gives 304... So I assume the cable is *not* mounted (even though it's detected by the Profiler)
09:13  joakimk: I guess the question is; has anyone had experience with this? And how would I mount the cable?

10:15  joakimk: Anyone know how to mount a usb-serial device on osx? I mean, the cable is listed by System Profiler, but I can't see any device under /dev
10:16  joakimk: According to the vendor documentation, the device name should be "usbserial"
10:16  joakimk: I've tried downloading and installing various drivers from the vendor, but nothing changes (as far as I can see)
10:20  joakimk: I mean, if the hardware is properly configured, I should get some "usb" device under /dev right? I even check with "ls -l /dev | wc -l" that no new "files" appear in /dev when I plug on the cable... :(

12:02  ovrflw0x: is there any update available for Boot Camp to load windows 7 from USB flash drive?
12:03  ovrflw0x: it's asking for DVD
12:03  ovrflw0x: anyone?
12:04  ovrflw0x: someone?
12:04  ovrflw0x: yes You!
12:04  ovrflw0x: or do i "really" have to install rEFIt?
12:05  ovrflw0x: is there any way w/o using rEFIt?
12:05  ovrflw0x: anyway*
12:06  lhunath: is there any way to make OS X's Preview not suck terribly at search?
12:07  lhunath: eg. any way to search for multiple words/sentences, any way to search for non-word characters, any way to search case sensitively, etc. ?
12:09  ovrflw0x: yo lhunath how can i install windows 7 from boot camp via usb Flash drive?
12:10  lhunath: what are you asking me for?
12:11  lhunath: shrug.  stick in the flash drive; hold alt during boot and pray it gets recougnized.
12:12 +Tomis: google "mac bootcamp usb" second hit, http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=6920704&postcount=8
12:12 +Tomis: starts off with people saying it's not possible, and then osmeone jumps in and describes how ot do it
12:12 +Tomis: oh, it talks about rEFIT
12:13  ovrflw0x: lhunath: which bootloader do i need to use?
12:13  ovrflw0x: will it be windows bootloader?
12:13  ovrflw0x: if i just hit "option" key?
12:13  ovrflw0x: when the computer boots
12:14  lhunath: you're confused.
12:14  lhunath: the alt thing is recougnized by EFI, that's got nothing to do with windows' boot loader.
12:14  ovrflw0x: lhunath: after windows 7 gets 'installed'
12:15  ovrflw0x: how will i get the option of going into win or mac
12:15  ovrflw0x: i need boot loader for that
12:15  lhunath: you tell efi which partition to boot from by default or use efi's hotkeys to choose one at boot.
12:16  ovrflw0x: oh ok so i don't need refit or boot camp?
12:16  ovrflw0x: i just need boot camp for partitioning
12:16  ovrflw0x: right?
12:16  lhunath: shrug.  boot camp is a bunch of stuff.
12:16  ovrflw0x: k bud laterz then... XD
12:16  ovrflw0x: i guess i just need to reboot and install win on this imac
12:17  lhunath: and refit may sometimes give you more boot options but it rarely allows you to successfully boot off of them; firmware limitations
12:17  lhunath: just make a separate partition; boot the windows installer; and install to it.
12:17  ovrflw0x: rite/
12:17  lhunath: it's spelled: "right".
12:17  lhunath: it's really not that hard.
12:17  ovrflw0x: yea 
12:18  lhunath: neither the installing or the spelling.
12:18  ovrflw0x: k bud lhunath 
12:18  ovrflw0x: take it ez
12:18  lhunath: ..
12:18  ovrflw0x: laters now
12:18  lhunath: idiot speak.

15:39  Tu13es: i just unplug it usually

16:24  hvgotcodes: if i had a mac air, and a bunch of ipod touches/ipads, could i run a webapp demo just off the air?
16:24  hvgotcodes: i.e. do i need a network, or can the air act as the router?
16:24  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: the air should be fine as the server
16:25  zer0her0: i'd suggest getting the 4GB RAM upgrade
16:25  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: right, but normally a webapp comes up under localhost:port/app
16:25  hvgotcodes: so in my office, i run my server off my MBP
16:25  hvgotcodes: and hten i point whatever at 102.169.1.1:port/app
16:25  zer0her0: it would be no different then running it off the MBA if you're used to running it off the mBP
16:26  hvgotcodes: without the network, what is the url?
16:26  zer0her0: MBP*
16:26  zer0her0: whatever IP the MBA assigns itself
16:26  zer0her0: hold on
16:28  zax1: how do i opne .hta files in mac osx ? how can i run any activeX needed sites ?
16:29  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: whatever the iPod touch/iPad report as their host, generally 10.0.2.1
16:29  zer0her0: zax1: by installing windows in a VM or in bootcamp
16:29  zer0her0: activeX is a windows specific technology
16:29  zer0her0: and super old
16:29  zax1: what about hta files - html applications ?
16:30  zer0her0: safari, chrome, firefox, opera
16:30  zax1: zer0her0: they cant open it
16:30  zax1: or more acuretly , i could not open it with safari
16:31  zer0her0: zax1: more info as i've never heard of an hta file
16:33  zax1: i think its a packaged html file it means you can run html files with higher privilages. all cbt nuggets software uses an hta as its wrapper to play their UI and with in it embed  wmv files
16:33  zax1: i can play the videos individualy but without the UI
16:34  zer0her0: run html files...with higher privilages...does not compute
16:34  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: so you are saying with just the air/mbp, and a bunch of iDevices, i should be good.
16:34  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: as long as the server is configed right on whatever device
16:34  zer0her0: but yes
16:35  zer0her0: i used to do all my dev when i was in college and freelancing on my laptop just fine
16:35  zer0her0: as we didn't have the fangled broadband and wifis all over the place back then
16:35  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: cool
16:35  zer0her0: hvgotcodes: yes quite :)
16:36  zer0her0: zax1: you have installed flip4mac right?
16:36  hvgotcodes: zer0her0: as long as i don't need a wifi network -- thats the only question i had
16:37  zer0her0: shouldn't, just tested it just fine here
16:37  hvgotcodes: i thought the macs could od it just not sure
16:37  zax1: when using parallels, is it just running a windows desktop, or is it seemlessly running the applications using a windows engine with out  having to open  a windows desktop
16:37  zer0her0: using an iPad and a mac pro
16:37  zer0her0: could od?
16:37  zer0her0: zax1: it's the windows desktop, the whole kit and caboodle.
16:38  zax1: i have installed flip4mac, and its opening the wmvs no problems
16:39  zax1: would vm fusion be better or parallels ?
16:39 +Tomis: parallels is a VM, a virtual PC inside your mac
16:39  zer0her0: zax1: it's a matter of preference i find
16:39 +Tomis: it's not emulating windows, but an entire computer, so you can run whatever OS you want on it
16:39  zer0her0: vmware fusion, parallels and virtual box are all pretty close
16:40  zer0her0: you just want alot of RAM
16:40  zer0her0: also look at the features of each they all have little things that some people love or hate
16:40  zax1: a lot of my work involves connecting to CRM and sharepoint and they all seem to really like only IE
16:40  zer0her0: but the base is close enough to be fine for most people
16:40  zax1: MS dynamic CRM that is
16:41  zer0her0: *shrug* i don't use any MS stuff other then my xbox really.
16:43  alexbobP: zax1: parallels can indeed run your windows apps on your mac desktop
16:43  alexbobP: they'll have windows' chrome though
16:44  zer0her0: alexbobP: it's still running windows in the background
16:44  alexbobP: zer0her0: true
16:44  alexbobP: zer0her0: but it has a mode where it hides the desktop and shows you the programs
16:44  zer0her0: yes both parallels and vmware fusion have done that for a while now
16:44  zax1: i'd really like to be able to use ms dynamics crm from safari, but no one seems to know how to do it
16:45  zer0her0: zax1: i doubt that's going to happen
16:45  alexbobP: what's ms dynamics crm?
16:46  zax1: back in the days of opera 6 or 7 it had a mode that it can mask itself as IE 6 you could use it it then for all the MS stuff
16:47  zer0her0: zax1: on mac os?
16:47  alexbobP: oh, you're just talking about spoofing the user agent string?
16:47  alexbobP: you can do that, but directx still won't work
16:47  alexbobP: er, not directx, that other dumb microsoft X thing
16:48  zax1: MS dynamics CRM is a server program for managing Accounts, tech support, contacts,  - can run sales reports, workflows quite good
16:48  zax1: alexbobP: you mean active X ?
16:48  zax1: no active x wasnt working on it
16:49  zer0her0: zax1: chrome has an extension that will mask itself as IE and even render like IE, I believe it's windows only though
16:49  alexbobP: zax1: yeah, that one!
16:49  alexbobP: activex... awful idea for a technology
16:49  alexbobP: "lets make it so websites get to run software on your computer!"
16:50  zax1: you dont need active x for CRM (afaik) 
16:50  zax1: there is a good call for it
16:51  zax1: you can create an aplpication based on a browser that can interact better with the pc
16:51  alexbobP: that's not really a legitimate thing to do
16:51  alexbobP: if you want the user to download and install software, you should provide software to download and install without tying it to the browser
16:51  zer0her0: zax1: *buzzer* wrong
16:52  alexbobP: applications based on the browser should *not* interact better with the pc.  they should be isolated, because that's the point of a browser... to let a user sift through bullshit with minimal danger
16:52  zax1: there is obviously a security issue with it , but you can build apps based on the browser - you dont have to reinvent the wheel  everytime you build a new app
16:52  zax1: but then again..... what do i know
16:52  zer0her0: zax1: here's an idea, why not contact MS since they're a business and i'm guessing you pay for their software
16:52  alexbobP: reeinvent *what* wheel?  you can grab an OSS browser and package it into any app easily these days
16:52  alexbobP: you don't have to re-code anything
16:53  alexbobP: I'm just saying that it shouldn't connect itself to a users *already-running* browser if it wants special priveleges on the machine
