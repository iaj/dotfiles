00:06  blez: al_admeld it says "User" dunno if that's the admin
00:06  blez: how to get that password?
00:06  vxla: DistortedLoop: sure, if you compile it. NOt sure if there's a mac ports for it.
00:07  al_admeld: blez: sounds like you downloaded pirated software.
00:07  DistortedLoop: vxla okay.  
00:16  blez: al_admeld maybe, maybe not.

02:24  ChrisAM: plug it in and connect with airport utility
02:25  bonhoffer: ChrisAM: thanks
02:25  ChrisAM: if it's new or reset, it will show up as Apple Network-AABBCCDD
02:26  Branes: How many internet archivists do you know? http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/2720 -- When Yahoo quietly announced they were pulling the plug on geocities.com a team of archivists hammered the Yahoo servers, and they were still sucking furiously when sites started to vanish. After a year of collating, TextFiles will release Geocities as a 900 GB torrent for whomever wants it.
02:27  bonhoffer: yeah, it is not discovering
02:27  bonhoffer: ChrisAM: any troubleshooting options -- it is blinking amber, which means it can't find an ip
02:29  ChrisAM: it doesn't need an ip for you to manage it.
02:29  ChrisAM: reset it with a paperclip

03:00  almonds: is there a downside to using file vault?
03:00  mininessie: so what is mac 
03:01  bonhoffer: ChrisAM: oh, thanks btw, it works great
03:01  mininessie: is mac a virus i heard it is
03:01  Soulathyia: -_-
03:01  mininessie: ?
03:01  Soulathyia: are you kidding?
03:01  mininessie: Soulathyia, nope
03:02  Soulathyia: you don't know what a mac is?
03:02  mininessie: Soulathyia, correct i know its a computer but what kind  a super computer?
03:03  ChrisAM: almonds ... just don't forget your password.
03:03  ChrisAM: almonds ... I use it, and don't notice a performance hit.
03:03  Soulathyia: http://www.apple.com/
03:03  mininessie: Soulathyia, apple is a fruit yes
03:04  Soulathyia: -_-
03:04  Soulathyia: If i knew you in real life i'd smack you
03:04  Branes: almonds: The main downsides of FileVault is that to encrypt your entire home folder, it needs as much space again on your hard drive to hold the unencrypted version, and also Time Machine will not back up anything in your home folder until you log out.
03:04  mininessie: Soulathyia, why
03:04  almonds: that was my concern
03:04  almonds: the disk space
03:04 * Branes hands mini a book of cluepons
03:04  almonds: i have a 128gig ssd
03:04  Soulathyia: click that link i posted
03:05  ChrisAM: You only need that space if you decide to turn filevault off.
03:05  Branes: almonds: If you are relying on an SSD, it is *imperitive* that you have a ruthless backup habit.
03:05  almonds: ssd no good?
03:05  Branes: Not trustworthy.
03:05  ChrisAM: SSD is too new for me to put my confidence in it.
03:06  almonds: if i dont plan to turn off filevault im fine?
03:06  Branes: More than half the machines my work sells that come with an SSD as standard come back for a new SSD after 6-9 months.
03:07  ChrisAM: almonds ... yeah.
03:07  ChrisAM: I use rsync to backup my home directory... I can do that while logged in.
03:07  Branes: almonds: With a 128GB SSD, you are limited to a maximum of 40 GB for your home folder.
03:09  Branes: almonds: SSDs suffer damage whenever they are written to, it is an intrinsic fault in the technology. To alleviate the damage somewhat, SSDs need to have an OS that supports both TRIM and spread-cell management ... OSX does neither.
03:09  Soulathyia: how do people not know what mac's are?
03:09  Branes: And OSX is rapacious when it comes to writing stuff to disk.
03:09  mininessie: Soulathyia, cause i am trolling
03:09  Soulathyia: i hope so
03:10 * Branes nails a sign to the front of ##mac which reads "DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS"
03:10  Soulathyia: lol
03:10  almonds: i'll leave it off
03:10  almonds: and use truescrypt
03:10  almonds: truecrypt
03:11  Soulathyia: Cerdric>	tell him he is a rather ineffective troll
03:11  Branes: Truecrypt does not work properly with OSX.
03:11  ChrisAM: Branes ... I don't think that's correct about the sizes.
03:11  Soulathyia: You are a rather ineffective troll mininessie
03:11  ChrisAM: According to apple support: "The maximum size of a FileVault home directory is set to the available disk space when FileVault is turned on."
03:11  Branes: ChrisAM: It is, once you factor in OSX's requirements for 10GB or 10% of the boot volume to be kept as free space for optimal system performance.
03:11  mininessie: Soulathyia, well i don't care i use a macbook pro and run linux on it
03:13  Branes: almonds: If you want to keep things away from prying eyes, do not leave them on the computer. If you do have stuff you wish to protect with encryption, save them to an encrypted .dmg file.
03:13  Soulathyia: good for you
03:14  Soulathyia: If you ever want to meet a real troll #dav2
03:14  Soulathyia: Maybe he can teach you someting

03:19  almonds: any anti-forensic tips/tricks for mac?
03:20  Branes: Apart from what I just told you, no.
03:22  Branes: The most secure way to protect data is to not leave it on the computer in the first place. Using a USB flash-drive with a built-in biometric sensor and onboard encryption engine is still the most convenient and safe way to store information.
03:23  Branes: Besides, no matter what form of encrytion you end up using, if someone really wants in, they can get in.

04:45  totic: Hey, I have been a long time Mac user, but have never used "Services" does anybody actually use them?
04:46  ChrisAM: Services?
04:48  jeffszusz: yeah what are you referring to as "Services" ?
04:49  al_admeld: totic: its just like a shortcut for application actions. theyre as useful as you make them.
04:49  Tsavo: Aren't they not available in Snow Leopard?
04:49  al_admeld: Tsavo: sure they are, click finder in the top menu
04:50  Tsavo: I'm not running Snow Leopard, that's why I phrased it as a question.
04:50  Tsavo: I thought I read somewhere that they took them out.
04:50  totic: al_admeld:  but do you ever use them?
04:50  al_admeld: totic: no, ive used automator, which is pretty much what services is.
04:50  totic: ChrisAM:  when you click on the Aplication menu, there are a list of services that you can use
04:51  totic: Tsavo:  yeah they are integrated to every application that can use them 
04:51  totic: they are located in the menu of each application (the one left of File)
04:51  al_admeld: totic: its kind of a ploy to appeal to power users, but its not exactly useful for me anyway
04:51  ChrisAM: oh.... I don't use them
04:51  totic: I was wondering if anybody did
04:52  totic: I come from the world of linux, so most stuff like that I end up doing it in the terminal, but I thought there might be something nice that I was missing
04:52  jeffszusz: i've never seen a useful service in that menu
04:52  jeffszusz: it's usually empty
04:52  Tsavo: I knew what they are, just wondering if they were still around. I've never actually used them though lol.
04:53  al_admeld: totic: theres nothing really useful that i need to do outside of a terminal automatically 
04:53  al_admeld: totic: i guess if you use mac applications to do repetitive things, its easier than using applescript or such
04:53  totic: jeffszusz: it changes depending what you are doing it, if you try it on chrome nothing will appera, but if you select text then they do 
04:54  al_admeld: totic: you can pick what/when things appear
04:54  totic: true, ok so I guess I am not missing out on anything there
04:54  jeffszusz: ...

04:54  al_admeld: key: apple
04:54  key: no
04:54  key: they charge too much
04:55  al_admeld: key: then say that in your question 
04:55  jeffszusz: key: that's because they're the only ones who have the good batteries.
04:55  key: pff ya right
04:55  key: what makes you say that
04:55  al_admeld: key: your battery lasted almost 3 years, right
04:55  key: no
04:55  jeffszusz: ...because their batteries are designed specifically for them, proprietary
04:55  jeffszusz: third party batteries are manufactured third party too.
04:55  key: i got 95 charges out of it before service indicator lit up
04:56  key: so fuck apple batteries
04:56  al_admeld: key: sounds like you need a pc
04:56  key: like that has anything to do with the issue of the battery you weirdo
04:56  jeffszusz: 95 charges? that's like three months
04:56  jeffszusz: your'e still in warrantee with that
04:56  key: jeff, i kept my macbook on AC for the first year
04:56  key: then started using battery this past year
04:56  al_admeld: key: weirdos are people who calculate how many charges they get from batteries
04:57  key: al_admeld: fucking dumbass, you can look in system profiler and it'll tell you
04:57  totic: al_admeld: there are applications that actually tell you this
04:57  al_admeld: key: i think you kept a tally
04:57  key: educate yourself before you shit from your mouth
04:57  jeffszusz: key: you had your macbook plugged in and never used the battery down for a year?
04:57  key: jeff, well rarely
04:57  key: but mainly AC
04:57  al_admeld: key: you sound like the kind of person who would write down the time and date of every charge
04:57  jeffszusz: that's why the battery died then
04:57  key: jeffszusz: do tell
04:57  jeffszusz: key: you can't let a battery stagnate like that
04:58  al_admeld: key: http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html educate yourself
04:58  jeffszusz: you ever get a brand new package of batteries and leave them in the cupboard
04:58  jeffszusz: a year later they don't work?
04:58  jeffszusz: even tho they are new?
04:58  key: not sure, rarely use batteries
04:58  key: but i guess so?
04:58  jeffszusz: well
04:59  al_admeld: key: l2r: Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time.
04:59  jeffszusz: leaving your computer plugged in without ever using up the battery is bad noise
04:59  key: jeffszusz: ok so who would you recommend i purchase a battery from?
05:00  treeshoe: I installed apache using ports, how do I get it to start on boot?

05:11  al_admeld: Al2O3: ~3 for free range

08:58  Branes: Every write cycle to an SSD is akin to a cigarette to the lungs - minute, cumulative, irreversible damage.
08:59  almonds: what kind of mac do u have branes
08:59 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 81 seconds
09:01  Branes: almonds: Several - there's two Macintosh Pluses (86 & 87 vintage) in the studio, a 5260 as a HyperCard machine, but my main workstation is a grey G3/300 running MacOS 8.6, and connected to that is a headless G4/500DP running 10.4.11 solely for internet duties.
09:02  Branes: I've got a 7600/200, LC630 DOS Compatible, another two G4/500DPs and a G5 2.0 DP in storage.
09:03  LSD`: I bet that LC630 isn't DOS compatible anymore, heh
09:03  almonds: seruously
09:03  almonds: you main box is from 98
09:03  almonds: ihad to google that
09:04  Branes: It still is, LSD` - handles PC-DOS and Win 3.11 very nicely. Well, it did the last time I fired it up.
09:04  LSD`: Who were Apple sourcing the chips from for those cards?
09:04  Branes: almonds: Yes, seriously -- I fix too many Intel machines to trust them, besides, what I have meets all of my computing needs admirably.
09:05  almonds: what is your profession
09:05  Branes: LSD`: Intel, of course - 486SX/66. I keep it purely for curiosity value, and it was a gift :)
09:06  almonds: is this what you have, http://www.everymac.com/images/cpu_pictures/apple_powermac_g3bondi.jpg
09:06  LSD`: Branes: " Flatly refuse to own anything with an Intel in it." ;)
09:06  Branes: almonds: I wear several hats - teacher, gardener, part time Apple technician (been one since 1981), musician, remedial massage therapist ...
09:07  almonds: i envy you
09:08  almonds: that sounds awesome, i could use some gardening 
09:08  almonds: seems relaxing
09:09  LSD`: almonds: by "gardening" he means the hydropnic kind, growing "you know what" ;)
09:09  almonds: tomatoes?
09:09  Branes: *shrug* I realised attempting a 9-5 job just wasn't possible for me, so I opted for quality of life instead. Needs are met, wants are few.
09:09  almonds: thats what i need to do!
09:09  Branes: Pff, hydroponic produces garbage.
09:10  almonds: you live in the U.S?
09:10  Branes: Not a chance, cobber :)
09:10  almonds: see
09:10  almonds: thats why i asked
09:10  almonds: i wish i could just leave the country and live a quality life like that
09:10  almonds: it makes you well rounded
09:10  almonds: someday.. some day..
09:11  Branes: LSD`: at the moment our garden is coming up beans & peas (nearly a dozen varieties of each), and I put some more iceberg & rocket in a couple weeks ago.
09:11  LSD`: not the kind of greens I was talking about ;)
09:12  almonds: what country btw?
09:13  Branes: .au
09:13  Branes: God's Own Earf Mate.
09:14  almonds: i need a quality of life
09:15  almonds: i live in america and i dont feel like i have a quality of life
09:15  almonds: pretty sad
09:15  almonds: and im in ny
09:31  neekers_: i'm trying to do a restore in time machine from 10 minutes ago. when i open up time machine and go back to that restore point, the restore button on the right seems to be greyed out, not sure what i'm doing wrong

10:00  Tomis: it backs up the whole system unless you specifically tell it to ignore system files
10:01  danl: hence why it requires so much space
10:08  neekers_: i'm trying to cross compile glib2 library for the iphone and it depends on a library called iconv which is in /usr/lib, i created an iphone version of iconv, but when i try to compile glib2 it uses the one in /user/lib which is not the one i need. i deleted the iconv.dylib in /usr/lib and then the cross-compiler refused to work... :)
10:09  neekers_: libiconv.dylib that is
10:10  Sia-: hi
10:11  Sia-: i have a new keyboard layout as *.keyboard file, where i have to move this file that i have this layout in my keyboard layout settings or options? which directory?
10:12  Sia-: :)
10:15  Sia-: i know how to added the layout in *linux family but not in BSD or mac, someone her can help?
10:44  antlong: anyone know how to build ircd properly on 10.6
10:48  mrh: is the windows key the same spot as the mac command keY?
10:48  Branes: antlong: stick in a VM with an appropriate linux distro
10:48  Branes: mrh: no
10:48  mrh: where is it relative to the ctrl and alt?
10:48  Branes: swapped with the alt/option key.
10:49  mrh: oh okay cool. 
10:49  Branes: On a Mac it reads ctrl-option-command-space, on windows it is ctrl-windows-alt-space
10:49  mrh: i was like how do mac users get used to this 
10:49  Branes: it's more complicated than just that, on MacOS you don't use the control key for shortcuts.
10:50  mrh: yeah that also
10:50  mrh: the biggest one for me has been home/end
10:50  Branes: I find the Windows way more complex, tbh
10:50  mrh: i have to hit windowskey + right arrow
10:50  Branes: Nah. up arrow or down arrow.
10:50  mrh: i only use the windows key for like windows+E or win+d
10:50  mrh: up or down arrow?
10:51  Branes: Yep, takes you to the start or end of the line
10:51  mrh: doesnt on my mac
10:51  mrh: that moves my page up or down
10:52  Branes: it should never do that
10:52  Branes: I've never heard of a Mac doing that, even if the machine was stuck using an inferior keyboard layout :)
10:53  mrh: yeah i defnitely hit windowskey+ right arrow to go to the end of a line
10:53  mrh: and windows key up/down arrow does page scrolling
10:53  Branes: nononono
10:53  Branes: no windows key
10:53  Branes: just the arrow key by themselves.
10:53  mrh: down arrow moves me to the next character slot?
10:53  mrh: like down
10:53  mrh: and right does the same
10:54  mrh: as if we are in a big text file
10:54  Branes: Nope. OSX doesn't do that, unless you're inside a text editor.
10:54  mrh: im in xcode
10:54  mrh: that is all my mac does =)
10:54  Branes: ewww.
10:55  mrh: it may eventually becme my media pc
10:55  mrh: that remote thing is kinda cool
10:55  mrh: with the iphones
10:58  Branes: That reminds me. I should find out when my copy of Marten is meant to arrive.
10:58  Branes: code-free programming, woohoo!
10:59  mrh: marten?
11:00  mrh: i googled it and got a badger
11:00  mrh: i think
11:00  Branes: http://www.andescotia.com/ -- Draw code, don't write it!
11:01  mrh: interesting
11:01  mrh: kind of cool as it could be used in the rapid application aspect of things
11:01  mrh: like c#
11:01  mrh: although xcode seemed pretty drop and draggy already for cocoa stuff
11:02  Branes: Oh, no no no, Marten is a full IDE, not a prototyping thing. The code it makes is hellishly efficient.
11:03  Branes: If you wand an RPE, use Supercard. It's brilliant for that. High level languages are for those with low levels of intelligence :)
11:03  Tomis: oh god
11:03  Tomis: supercard
11:03  Tomis: horrible
11:04  Branes: When was the last time you used it, Tom?
11:04  Tomis: years ago
11:04  Tomis: but it's card based, what more do you need to know
11:04  Tomis: programing isn't that freakin hard, get a book, learn it
11:04  Tomis: stop trying to take the janky easy way out people
11:05  Branes: Supercard has outgrown that, the version that's been shipping fro the last three years or so is simple brilliance
11:05  Tomis: can it make native cocoa apps?
11:05  Tomis: with a full normal interface like any standard mac app?
11:06  Branes: Marten can. Supercard can still make standalone stuff, but it works best as a prototyping tool.
11:06  Tomis: i remember my friends making cheesy little games with that thing back in the day
11:06  Branes: Build the interface first, then figure out the logic behind the interface. That's the proper Mac way to do things.
11:07  Tomis: can do that using apple's own tools though
11:07  Branes: RPE = Rapid Protoping Environment.
11:07  Branes: Nowhere *near* as fast as what Supercard can.
11:07  Branes: Not. Even. Close.
11:08  Tomis: window, drag in controls,
11:08  Tomis: how much more rapid can you get
11:08  mrh: that is what i was thinking
11:08  mrh: IB ties in with xcode nicely
11:08 * Branes still feels Supercard does it better.
11:09  mrh: i learned to code c at a job a while back, and a few quick chapters from a few different books has got me transitioned to the iphone rather nicely
11:09  Branes: But then you're just stuck with a framework, so outside of a proof of concept, it's not much chop. Typing code? Fuck that for a barrel o' goatse.
11:09  Branes: Marten ftqw.
11:10  Tomis: drawing code sounds like a barrel of fail to me
11:11  Tomis: much like the WYSIWYG web design crap
11:11  mrh: there is a time and place for both.
11:12  mrh: i mean if you just need some data represented and they have the proper tools to handle that data go for it
11:12  mrh: i have seen plenty of c# apps handle database stuff quickly
11:12  mrh: cant write that in c or a high level language that easy.
11:12  mrh: however, cant write graphical engines that render at 60fps with such ease in the drop/drag environments either
11:14  Branes: If you're not doing *that* in assembler, it's just as much a fail.
11:16  mrh: i disagree
11:16  mrh: most games dont have that much optimized via assembly.
11:18  Tomis: who codes in ASM anymore
11:18  Tomis: code it for the iphone, port it to the mac if you feel like going nuts
11:28  spaceninja: I booted up a powermac g4 into target mode, firewire thing, then I connected to another mac, but no harddrive is popping up, what should I do, I need to recover some files.
11:28  LSD`: Modern C compilers are able to optimise as good or better than raw asm, Branes is just showing his age
11:29 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
11:30  Tomis: open disk utility spaceninja 
11:31  Tomis: if it's not showing up in there, then look in system profiler
11:31  Tomis: make sure the system is even detecting that it's connected to something on firewire
11:34  joako: Holy *#$@ HyperCard lives on... I thought that was long long dead
11:36  Branes: spaceninja: Double check the cable is firmly in the sockets, and you see the FireWire logo on the target G4's screen. Open Disk Utility on the host Mac. The G4 should appear as a device on the left side. If it does not, either your cable is faulty, or the G4's FireWire is faulty. If you see the G4 interface but there is no hard drive indented underneath, then the G4's hard drive has died.
11:40  spaceninja: ok thanks Branes and Tomis 
11:42  joobie: hey guys.. looking at this apple script http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/AppleScript_Programming/Mail.app_archive_selected_inbox_messages which works on "selected messages" within mail.app.. problem is, im not sure how to run it on selected mail items? I normally use rules to run scripts but it wouldnt be relevant here for selected items...
11:45  Tomis: select some messages in the list, then run the script via the script menu?
11:48  joobie: hmm where is the script menu
11:48  joobie: i select the messages in mail, not seeing script?
11:50  Tomis: you have to enable the scripts menu
11:50  Tomis: or just save the script as an app and run it on its own
11:50  joobie: how do u enable the scripts menu?

11:52  Tomis: yes
11:52  Tomis: they changed the name slightly in 10.6
11:52  joobie: ok
11:53  joobie: so i selected that show the script menu
11:53  joobie: closed script editor
11:53  joobie: and reloaded mail
11:53  joobie: but i dont see it?
11:53  joobie: sorry noob with with

11:54  Tomis: you have to instal the script so it will show up in the script menu
11:56  joobie: hmm
11:56  joobie: i loaded applescript
11:56  joobie: pasted that script above in applescript, saved it 
11:56  joobie: then go into mail, select emails
11:56  joobie: not sure how to run it now
11:56  joobie: i dont have a script menu in mail even though i sleected that option in preferences in applescrip
11:59  Tomis: you can't just save the script and expect it to work
11:59  Tomis: you'd have to save it in the specific correct location
12:01  joobie: yea i got it
12:01  joobie: sorry :)
12:01  joobie: u gotta run appleiscript editor at the same time
12:02  Tomis: huh?
12:02  Tomis: you can save the script as an application and run it from anywhere
12:02  Tomis: or save it in the correct folder for the script menu to list it
12:02  joobie: ahh i duno man
12:02  joobie: i dont have a script menu coming up in mail.app

13:54  londonmet050: any one had same problem like that video
13:54  londonmet050: Is it due to over heat?

13:56  xushi: that's crazy.. no i haven't experienced or heard of anyone i know that had that
13:56  xushi: i wouldn't think it's due to over heating, but it *could* be possible..
13:57  londonmet050: when i close MBP
13:58  londonmet050: i can see the front lid is slightly towards left
13:58  londonmet050: like it is moved
13:58  londonmet050: I am not sure if my eyes are playing
13:58  londonmet050: or something
13:58  xushi: if it were heat related, i would have presumed you would see damage on the rear side rather than the front.
13:58  xushi: how old is it?
13:58  londonmet050: few months
13:59  xushi: if it's really visible, it might be worth sending it back for repairs
13:59  xushi: is the gap big enough so that the magnet doesn't hold the side togethers?
13:59  xushi: -s 
13:59  londonmet050: no
13:59  londonmet050: it is very slight
14:00  xushi: is it a new or refurbished mac?
14:00  londonmet050: i have to pass my hand on either side
14:00  xushi: it might have a slight mis-alignment on the back side where the screws are attached... that could be it
14:00  londonmet050: I can see that left side is pushed a bit up
14:00  londonmet050: NEw
14:00  londonmet050: ok
14:00  londonmet050: I was taking ti around few days ago
14:01  xushi: the longer you wait the more of an excuse they'll have to blame it on you... you might as well go to an apple tech center and insist that something is askew

14:04  xushi: cool
14:05  londonmet050_: I can see it got mad heated over few days
14:07  xushi: hmm, mine gets really hot especially when i play HL2 or Doom ]|[, or encoding.. but i haven't seen this problem before
14:08  londonmet050_: may be it moved when I was carrying around
14:10  xushi: when you open it, is your hand always on the center or on the sides? 
14:10  xushi: that may affect it
14:12  londonmet050_: i always open from center
14:12  MrJones: hi
14:13  MrJones: python is configured to run preferrably with 32bit on my system
14:13  MrJones: (with that nice command "man python" mentions)
14:13  MrJones: now that works fine for a python I fire up myself from the terminal (e.g. just "python" there)
14:13  MrJones: but a python running from inside a virtualenv will *always* run in 64bit mode
14:13  MrJones: :(
14:14  MrJones: that's quite odd since I got some libs that dislike 64bit and therefore I'd really need a 32bit python (getting it to run in 64bit is probably possible but will involve a lot of hassle)
14:14  MrJones: anyone having an idea what to do about this?
14:14  MrJones: virtualenv was installed through easy install
14:31  londonmet050_: what app is using ajax server
14:46  masu3701: i have a track pad that works perfectly on macbook pro but wont work that great on new macbook...are those design for the pro?
14:49  Branes: No, it should work the same on all machines. If you're experiencing problems, it could be a hardwre fault.
14:49  Tu13es: is there a software update?
14:50  masu3701: its works great on pro but not macbook..cant croll up and down using 2 fingers...copying is hard....
14:50  Tu13es: did you change settings accordingly in System Preferences?
14:50  Tu13es: and is there a software update for it?
14:50  masu3701: but on macbook pro everything works fine
14:51  masu3701: Tu13es: i did change settings
14:51  masu3701: checking software update
15:01  MrJones: I got a problem
15:01  MrJones: my system python environment sucks (has got lots of outdated packages provided by apple and other issues)
15:01  MrJones: and virtualenv always runs python in 64bit
15:02  MrJones: I require a clean and nicely working python env (which virtualenv provides) running in _32bit_ though (which virtualenv doesn't seem to provide whatever I do)
15:02  MrJones: anyone has an idea how to make virtualenv run python in 32bit?? or can someone tell me whether it is POSSIBLE at all

16:34  topriddy: crilly: weeks now...was the guy that talked/asked about Virtual Box and also about Battery duration ( someone suggested coconut app) or so
16:34  crilly: Oh I see.
16:35  topriddy: and yes my first Apple OS came with my first MacBookPro few months (2) ago...so yes I am new :D
16:36  topriddy: but i have an intermediate linux knowledge plus i am technology inclined...so i have being managing very well
16:36  crilly: I'm jealous - I loved the excitement of my first Mac :)

16:37  topriddy: crilly: if you grew up on M$ thing and you were thrust an OS X you would want to have tasted a different OS than M$ priori
16:38  topriddy: most people  - where am from actually believe M$ way is the only way of doing stuffs...#seriously. 
16:39  crilly: That's the way everywhere topriddy - thagt is why MS is so large, but that is changing rapidly.
16:39  crilly: And MS know it is changing.
16:41  topriddy: too rapidly...it is changing in favour of linux though...
16:41  topriddy: thats why i want to keep/improve my linux skills...
16:42  topriddy: crilly: sometimes i wonder why there are too many viruses for the M$ system...not fair :(
16:43  zer0her0: Apple's market share is larger then linux by almost 2x
16:43  zer0her0: and it's growing faster
16:43  crilly: I agree to a point. I think because of Netbooks and other such devices, like mobile phones taking on Linux too, people are starting to notice it more. I think OS X/Macs will get bigger and bigger now thanks to the iPhone/iPad/iPod, but I also think someone is eventually going to create something from Linux like OS X. I wanted to make something using the Linux called (LFS) that only used KDE (because its UI is lush) and ONLY used applications that were com

16:44  crilly: topriddy: Where are you from?
16:44  crilly: zer0her0: Hi dude
16:45  topriddy: crilly: i am from Nigeria...I am a java developer (intermediate)...just graduated from university and doing the one year mandatory service so not actually working yet
16:45  zer0her0: crilly: sup
16:45  crilly: topriddy: I was offered a job in Nigeria in ICT years back. I was scared to take it if I'm honest with you.
16:45  topriddy: also do database stuff oracle and some other open source thingy and have a fairly web development and mobile skill set
16:46  crilly: topriddy: Excellent :)
16:46  topriddy: crilly: its okay...sometimes most of us here even want to go get a job abroad...
16:46  crilly: zer0her0: How is work going? Still mad busy? Still running ten departments?
16:46  zer0her0: Haha, my one coworker is back, the other is off maternity leave but in spain, manager is back most of the time
16:47  topriddy: crilly: so you do agree the number of macs to pcs are alarmingly low???
16:47  crilly: topriddy: I was told the violence can be quite bad, especially towards white people. Is that true?
16:47  zer0her0: so i'm back to a normal work load
16:47  crilly: zer0her0: Glad to hear it.
16:47  crilly: topriddy: No I don't agree with that fully. MS have a large grip on the world, but it's slipping at an alarming rate (alarming for MS).
16:47  crilly: Apple have a 20% market share I think.
16:48  crilly: Which is a lot more than I originally thought it was (I thought it was merely 5-8%).
16:48 --- basso_ is now known as basso
16:48  topriddy: crilly: 20% implies, 2 macs to every 10 pcs??? thats not what we have here
16:48  zer0her0: crilly: it was 5 in early 2k
16:48  masu3701: have a new macbook that wont turn on at all...charger light is on but computer wont turn on 
16:48  zer0her0: it's 20% of "new computers"
16:49  crilly: masu3701: No lights on the Mac anywhere?
16:49  crilly: zer0her0: ah
16:49  masu3701: no light
16:49  zer0her0: i think it's only up to 8-10% total market share or something.
16:49  zer0her0: masu3701: hold down power buttom for 10 seconds
16:49  zer0her0: then let go
16:49  zer0her0: and press it again
16:50  masu3701: I did..but wont turn on nor light
16:50  zer0her0: what machine?
16:50  zer0her0: just plain macbook?
16:50  crilly: topriddy: Well think about it, and please don't take offence, but Nigeria isn't a rice country and has a low GDP compared to say, England, France, Germany, etc. Windows is very easily pirated, OS X not so much. In fact, I'm sure MS have programs in place to pump Windows out into poor places likes Nigeria for free just to stop piracy and catch the market there.
16:51  topriddy: crilly: I totally agree! seriously!
16:51  masu3701: zer0her0: i have the new macbook 13' unibody
16:51  topriddy: crilly: thats why I tell everybody i know about alternatives, Linux alternatives...seriously...
16:52  topriddy: crilly: i once read some stuffs on www.whylinuxisbetter.com - some section there says it is better for developing nations to adopt linux and u believe so myself
16:53  zer0her0: masu3701: On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.
16:53  zer0her0: Release all the keys and the power button at the same time.
16:53  zer0her0: Press the power button to turn on the computer.
16:53  zer0her0: try those steps
16:53  crilly: topriddy: I agree, it is. It adopts openness and fairness, and there are no costs involved. Linux can be adopted to suit the environment it's in. Look at Ubuntu, isn't that from Africa?
16:54  zer0her0: plus it lets you build a knowledge base not connected to a company based in another country
16:54  zer0her0: the founder is from south africa
16:54  topriddy: crilly: am not certain it is...it just adopts africa theme in its motto...not sure Canonical is an african company
16:54  crilly: zer0her0: It's vender neutral, to a degree.
16:54  masu3701: zer0her0: nothing 
16:54  zer0her0: but developers of ubuntu/canonical are worldwide
16:55  zer0her0: masu3701: i'd bring it into an apple store
16:55  crilly: Ah OK. Maybe I misread. I thought "Ubuntu" was African for "Open" or something?
16:55  masu3701: ok
16:55  zer0her0: their HQ is apparently in england
16:56  zer0her0: crilly: it is
16:56  topriddy: well a mac is what it is...a rare gem
16:57  zer0her0: and the founder is south african
16:57  crilly: topriddy: How did you buy one in Nigeria?
16:58  topriddy: there is a mac shop , but i bought from a dealer Rolling Stones, Obafemi Awolow way for about N275,000.00 ( a dollar should be around 150 naira) so i was more expensive
16:58  crilly: eeek
16:58  topriddy: crilly: actually convinced my dad...took a long while for him to see why i couldnt continue using my old Dell Inspirion 6400
17:04  crilly: topriddy: haha nice. wow £1 = 239.72N :O
17:04  Al2O3: Good morning/afternoon/evening mac loving people.
17:04  crilly: topriddy: What would 239.72N get you in terms of food?
17:04  crilly: Al2O3: Hello :)
17:04  Al2O3: Did we continue on with the dozen egg cost questionaire?
17:05  topriddy: crilly: a nice plate of food with a bottle of drink in an average* restaurant
17:05  topriddy: crilly: what would #1 get you in terms of food?
17:07  topriddy: s/#/£
17:07  crilly: topriddy: It would get you a very cheap sandwich, if that. In terms of food, you would be quiet limited actually - you wouldn't be able to get a meal or anything substantial really. It wouldn't buy you a bottle of Coke Cola, but it would get you a can (330ml) of Coke Cola. It wouldn't even get you a bottle of mineral water in some cases.
17:07  crilly: Al2O3: I never seen that.
17:08  topriddy: crilly: seriously one pounds wouldnt feed a grown up? wow
17:09  crilly: topriddy: To get "a nice plate of food with a bottle of drink in an average* restaurant" you would need about £3-5, which is 719.17-1,198.61 N
17:12  crilly: topriddy: Some people do live on £1 a day, but they're homeless and take what they can get. My breakfast cost me £4 this morning from McDonald's. My MacBook Pro 13" 5,5 was about £900, which is 215,750.48N :O
17:13  topriddy: crilly: economic and financial calculations confuses me, am trying to see why tech material is cheaper over there while food is costlier...the difference is more than shipping and profits

21:03  MrUnagi: What services 
21:03  zer0her0: that's what i'm looking to build joako 
21:03  joako: They're just desktops with Windows XP for running Quickbooks, etc. They are Acer and were about $200 each
21:04  MrUnagi: Cool
21:04  joako: We're having too much fun with the kill-a-watt over there, turning down your monitor brightness from 100 to 15 doesn't affect usability but it saves 10 watts

21:10  bdelin88: Does pages really not have a document recovery built in???
21:11  zer0her0: Macs don't crash
21:11  zer0her0: why would we need doc recovery?
21:11  bdelin88: haha
21:11  bdelin88: bullshit
21:11  Tu13es: lol
21:11  bdelin88: yea my battery died in standby and I lost the document
21:12  bdelin88: not to mention that hibernation never works unless there is nothing open
21:12  bdelin88: brand new $3000 macbook pro
21:12  Tu13es: i'll take it off your hands
21:12  Soulathyia: mine was $5000
21:12  Soulathyia: how did you get it so cheap
21:12  Tu13es: you wont ever have to deal with it crashing again :P
21:12  Tu13es: Soulathyia: US prices
21:12  Tu13es: i'm guessin
21:12  Tu13es: g
21:12  Soulathyia: i am in the US
21:12  bdelin88: yea.. student discount but still
21:13  Tu13es: how did you manage to spend $5k on a MBP?
21:13  bdelin88: point being: wtf is with pages?  there has to be a temp file somewhere
21:13  bdelin88: yea the only way to do that is to get the monitor
21:13  Tu13es: ah, 512gb SSD is $1300, lol
21:13  zer0her0: Tu13es: i spent i think almost 7-8k on my machine
21:14  zer0her0: (well work spent)
21:14  Tu13es: zer0her0: yes but you are an idiot
21:14  bdelin88: oh yea forgot about the SSD, I am waiting
21:14  Tu13es: i just spec'd out one with *everything* added, it's $6607.85
21:15  bdelin88: can anyone help me out with pages though, please
21:15  zer0her0: well this is a tower
21:15  Tu13es: oh
21:16  zer0her0: hehe just speced out "the replacement" for this machine 10,035 USD

21:17 * zer0her0 calls up purchasing dept, hangs up while they're stilling yelling at him.
21:17  zer0her0: yea i guess i won't be ordering that yet.
21:17  Tu13es: even a RAM/SSD upgrade probably isn't justified
21:17  Tu13es: :(
21:17 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]

21:18  Tu13es: heh
21:21 * Branes reaches down & pats Brutus, chugging away contentedly with a single 300 MHz processor, 120 GB drive and 768 MB of RAM
21:22  LaraX: and everyone keeps telling me 2GB RAM isn't enough
21:22  bdelin88: well... except for the laptop design, I am really unimpressed with my mac as far as any benefits over windows
21:23  bdelin88: there are a few things built in that I like...but there are others that are like c'mon... you are really doing that just to "not be like windows"
21:24  Branes: OSX is for people who just want things to work and stay out of your face.
21:24  Branes: It's a creature-comfort OS :)
21:25  bdelin88: I am comfortable with it, but it bothers me that things like "print selection" are not built in....no brainers like that
21:25  zer0her0: bdelin88: i've never used print selection
21:25  zer0her0: either on pc or mac
21:26  Branes: If you decide you really don't like MacOS, don't make the mistake of trying to turn it into a Windows-onl (or gods forbid, linux only) laptop, sell it.
21:26  zer0her0: though i haven't used a classic printer in close to a decaade
21:26  bdelin88: lol how could you not
21:26  bdelin88: it is like one of the best features
21:26  zer0her0: printing == 90s
21:26 * Branes has never used it either
21:26 * zer0her0 lives in the 2k10s
21:26  Angostura: I agree on print selection - an odd omission
21:27  bdelin88: instead of copying text to pages and printing it, you can just highlight from a web page and print selection
21:27  Branes: And I've been computing on Macs since they came out, and Windows for just over a decade, I've never even considered using 'print selection'
21:27  bdelin88: another thing... right-click copy and right-click cut/move in finder... really??? 
21:27  zer0her0: yea i love losing my files
21:27  zer0her0: that's an awesome feature
21:27  Tsavo: You're the exception, not the rule Branes. It's a respectable feature
21:27  Branes: cutting files is a silly concept, no matter hat OS.
21:28  Angostura: bdelin88: Cutting files is daft
21:28  bdelin88: why would you want to copy and go back and delete the original if you just wanted to movie it in the first place
21:28  Tu13es: daft punk, that is
21:28  Tu13es: HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER
21:28  Branes: Tsavo: If I'm going to print -- and I still do a lot of that -- I print everything that I want to read
21:29  zer0her0: bdelin88: let me cut this file, oh someone emailed me let me copy and paste this text real qui...oohh i just wiped out my file.
21:29  zer0her0: or let me cut this file, no wait let me cut this file instead...where's that first file?...
21:29  bdelin88: ...
21:29  Tu13es: profit!
21:29  bdelin88: the file remains in place until it is actually pasted... it's not like text
21:29  Branes: Joooyyyy!!!! </stimpy>
21:30  zer0her0: ...so how is that different then copy?
21:30  Angostura: bdelin88: So it's not actually a cut
21:30  bdelin88: put something else on the clipboard and it remains in place...this is not new to operating systems both linux and windows do this
21:30  bdelin88: it's a cut... it's just "smart"
21:30  zer0her0: not new doesn't mean it's a good idea
21:31  bdelin88: all I am saying is dragging files around to move them is ridiculous
21:31  zer0her0: right clicking all over the place is equally ridiculous when you look at it that way
21:31  zer0her0: using computer is dumb actually.
21:31  Branes: The only reason why linux has it is because they copied Windows, and the only reason why Windows has it is because when Windows came out, mice were too expensive so most people were still stuck with a keyboard. HEELLOOOOOO, CAN I HAS CLUE PLS.
21:32  Angostura: Damn. I assumed I'd be able to use Automator to create a print selection service... but no
21:33  Branes: Apple does things differently. Adapt or perish; trying to co-erce OSX into being "more Windows like" is an exercise in frustration. Thank the gods.
21:33  bdelin88: let's not go all fan boy here... we're just talking.  I don't know what you're talking about all this right-click... I just feel that highlight->right-click->cut and find where you want to paste is better then highlight->drag file->drag file->drag file->drag file->drag file->drag file -> drop
21:33  Soulathyia: http://www.lxfx.org/dcit/
21:33  Soulathyia: you dont click on that site
21:34  zer0her0: bdelin88: are you that ADD that you don't know where you're dragging the file to?
21:35  bdelin88: I do know where I am dragging it to, just saying if you're going several sub folders deep, this is a very tedious task that could be done much easier with cut paste
21:35  bdelin88: this just feels like a nice feature that would be easy to implement that apple simply seems to think "oh we'll not be like windows and not include this just to be different"
21:36  zer0her0: they don't copy
21:36  zer0her0: sorry
21:36  zer0her0: moving on
21:36  Angostura: I think it is a nice feature yes. But I think it also breaches a ton of HIG rules since it is not like any other cut & paste on the system
21:37  Angostura: ... that's the reason Apple did not copy it
21:37  bdelin88: all I am saying is, copy it or find a better way to do it... I just find it irritating, and I really want to like this OS, I do...
21:38  bdelin88: and I am open minded and realize things are done differently
21:38  bdelin88: still... with an open mind, it is irritating
21:38  zer0her0: bdelin88: you're not being open minded
21:38  bdelin88: ...also irritating, buying appdelete just to remove all traces of a program
21:38  zer0her0: i can do drag and drop on all 3 systems just fine
21:39  Tsavo: http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/quick_access.html This is what I use
21:39  bdelin88: yea I can do it just fine too... it just takes longer, I don't think anyone can argue with that
21:39  zer0her0: i can
21:40  zer0her0: you're just not used to it and your muscle memory is lower on a mac so it makes you angry
21:40  zer0her0: that's understandable doesn't mean it's slower inherently
21:40  bdelin88: well, you also are coming off like a strong fanboy right now
21:41  bdelin88: and muscle memory, I can drag files faster than the drop to a new folder action can respond to
21:41  zer0her0: bdelin88: i use mac, winddows and linux
21:41  bdelin88: ditto
21:41  zer0her0: i just know the differences between the 3
21:41  zer0her0: it can be frustrating i know
21:42  zer0her0: but they are different systems they are inherently going to act differently
21:42  zer0her0: you want one unified system, use only one system.
21:42  bdelin88: yea I am fine with that, I acknowledge that... alllll I am saying is... I don't think the move option is friendly enough, I can't ever move the files fast enough through drag and drop, I am always waiting on apple to open the next sub folder
21:43  Angostura: zer0her0: I'm sure bdelin88 Would argue that, having used drag & drop on all 3 systems cut & paste is inherently quicker
21:43  bdelin88: Angostura: thank you, this is what I am saying
21:43  Tsavo: QuickAccessCM, the link I posted, is a board in the bridge that spans the gap between Windows and Mac
21:43  Bensawsome: Angostura depends what your used to
21:43  Bensawsome: i mean
21:43  Bensawsome: i like copying and pasting myself
21:43  Tsavo: also bdelin88 you can make the time that your folders spring open really short
21:43  Tsavo: they'll open almost instantly if you decide to make it so
21:43  Angostura: Bensawsome: I've used a Mac for 20 years and I infrequently use Windows
21:44  diamonds: I wish I could set default application based on some regex filters...
21:44  bdelin88: Tsavo: yes probably through finder options I am sure.. all I am saying is: right-click-> move would make me so happy
21:44  Bensawsome: doesnt mean you cant you copying and paste :P
21:44  Angostura: when I do use Windows, I use cut & paste if I remember to - because it is quick
21:44  diamonds: I'd like foo.com to open in FF but bar.com to open in Opera
21:44  Bensawsome: *you cant use copy and paste
21:44  Tsavo: http://free.abracode.com/cmworkshop/quick_access.html try this then bdelin88 
21:44  zer0her0: bdelin88: you do know you can have multiple finder windows open right?
21:44  diamonds: if I click on a url e.g. in an email
21:44  zer0her0: i always have at least 2 open
21:45  bdelin88: zer0her0: yes I know that...but still as efficiency goes.. I think this is still less efficient than one window cut paste
21:45  zer0her0: click destinate in first one, click source in second drag and drop from one to the other
21:45  zer0her0: max of 2-3 seconds at a time
21:45  zer0her0: not sure how you can get faster then that
21:45  bdelin88: but that is what I usually do, two windows
21:45  zer0her0: so you're just trolling got it
21:45  macius: hey my osx = broke, and im trying to recover data, to add to my problem my cd drive is malfunctioning, so the only solution i can think of ( without reparing/buying anything ) is booting a nix os from usb and using that to dd my osx fs to another comp, does efi like live usbs?
21:45 * zer0her0 goes back to actually working
21:46  diamonds: working on my "switch default app by URL pattern" I hope!
21:46  bdelin88: I guess there are just a few features that I expected would be built in that I didn't find, rather than implemented in entirely different ways, for what feels like, just for the sake of being different from other OS's
21:47  Tsavo: are you going to complete that thought?
21:47  diamonds: geez that convo on file moving is loooong
21:47  zer0her0: bdelin88: it IS a different OS
21:47  bdelin88: haha it's not just file moving, it was just an example
21:47  diamonds: I was trying to scrollback and pickup the thread...
21:47  bdelin88: let me put it this way
21:48  Tsavo: macius in my experience and from what i've heard, Mac booting from USB is hit and miss. maybe somebody can back me up or set me straight?
21:48  zer0her0: you may want to read the HIG: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000894-TP6
21:48  zer0her0: it describes alot of the reasons they chose to do what they do
21:48  zer0her0: it's not to be different or annoy windows users
21:48  zer0her0: or linux users
21:49  bdelin88: if tons of people out there want GPS in their vehicles and ford says alright we're going to be the first to do it, then GMC copies them because they want in on it too and think it's great... well then Dodge decides to just opt out of it or give you a paper map just because they want to be 'different'
21:49  bdelin88: alright I'll take a look at that, thank you
21:49  Tsavo: macius in my experience alone, i've never gotten it to work actually
21:49  Tomis: apple also completely ignores the HIG on a consistent basis
21:50  zer0her0: when in doubt make a car analogy
21:50  zer0her0: Tomis: shhhh
21:50  zer0her0: ;)
21:50  bdelin88: zer0her0: :) 
21:50  Tomis: especially on more recent apps
21:50  zer0her0: gah the trol is onto me
21:50  Tomis: and itunes
21:50  zer0her0: iTunes is the worst
21:50  bdelin88: well let's hope they do some ignoring on the basics
21:50  Tsavo: iTunes is teh first thing that came to mind too
21:50  Tomis: i wish they'd take their own damn advice though
21:50  zer0her0: hey lets take all these usability studies we did and toss them out the window
21:50  Tomis: exactly zer0her0 
21:51  Tsavo: Why'd they change the icon? The new blue round one doesnt fit any other OS X icons except maybe Safari
21:51  zer0her0: but realistically most problems people seem to complain about usage is muscle memory issues
21:52  Tomis: because it fits the new iOS direction better Tsavo 
21:52  Tomis: it's similar to the new mac app store icon
21:52  macius: Tsavo: ugh alright ill give it a shot i guess :\, ty
21:53  bdelin88: well I need to take my MBP to the store to get it looked at because the hibernation failures are driving me up the wall as well as having the absolute worst connection problems with WiFi compared with my 4 year old dell laptop
21:53  Tsavo: Macius I can tell you that Fedora 9 does Not boot from a Sandisk Cruzer Micro 4GB
21:53  Tomis: http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/
21:54  Tsavo: I guess you're right Tomis but it looks goofy
21:54  Tsavo: the iTunes one
21:54  Tomis: yea, too bad
21:54  Tomis: you will accept the changes steve brings down to you from on high
21:54  Tomis: you will bow down before the mighty apple
21:54  bdelin88: hehe
21:55  Tomis: woa
21:55  Tsavo: I'll avoid that so long as my macbook keeps going
21:55  Tomis: i just noticed the weird placement of the window widgets on the app store window
21:55  Tomis: why are the vertically centered on the toolbar, wtf
21:55  Tsavo: Maybe that will be the Lion standard?
21:55  Tsavo: Make them smaller so they're harder to click
21:56  Tomis: no titlebar either
21:56  Tomis: guess apple hates titlebars now
21:56  bdelin88: any of you guys get a MBP within the last few months?
21:56  b3ny0-: yes
21:56  Tomis: yes bdelin88 , what's up
21:56  bdelin88: and experiencing hibernation issues?
21:56  Tomis: nope
21:57  bdelin88: my MBP failes to come out of hibernation about 90% of the time
21:57  b3ny0-: well, I have actually noticed it freezing when opening the lid again
21:57  diamonds: idd yall see the footage of the guy who changed the itunes icon getting confronted at macworld expo? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E88HEuwInno#t=00m20s
21:57  b3ny0-: it was a long time ago since it happened now
21:57  bdelin88: not standbye, hibernation
21:57  b3ny0-: but I know precicely what you mean
21:57  Tomis: in fact when i get to like 1 minute left, the system shuts down, and when i wake it up i comes out of hibernation flawlessly
21:57  bdelin88: that would be awesome, I wouldn't have lost my documents on pages if that happened
21:58  Tomis: why didn't you save 'em?
21:58  bdelin88: I was with a girl? :)
21:58  Tomis: so?
21:58  bdelin88: just got up and left it
21:58  Tomis: always save your work man
21:58  Tomis: women are the number one cause of lost productivity
21:58  b3ny0-: especially when you're with girls
21:58  b3ny0-: :P
21:58  bdelin88: yea I usually do... I just felt confident that pages would take care of me if anything happened... wow can't wait to get ms office 2011
21:58  bdelin88: haha
21:59  Tomis: doesn't it autosave anyway?
21:59  bdelin88: apparently not
21:59  Tomis: well that's crappy
21:59  bdelin88: I wish I had never purchased iWork
21:59  Tomis: even text edit.app does autosave
22:00  Tomis: i love iwork, but i only use it for light usage, i've not heavy office suite requirements
22:00  bdelin88: I really detest it, I'll admit that most of it comes from lack of experience and differences of other programs... but now I really detest it for losing my work
22:00  Tomis: weird it doesn't have autosave
22:00  macius: Tsavo: lol alright ty, pretty sure it should work if i install the os on a usb, since efi will understand an mbr partition table and the usb will be ssen as a second disk =(... recovery sucks when your cd drive is broke lool
22:01  Tsavo: That's what I'm talking about ^ Macs booting from USB is very hit or miss, emphasis on the miss
22:02  Tomis: well bdelin88 , i'd try going through the usual generic steps, reset SMC, repair disk, repair disk permissions, run the extended hardware test from the system DVD (by booting holding D)
22:02  macius: btw i might aswell ask about my optical drive, when i put a disk in prior to osx failing , it attempted to read the disk 3 tims then i beleive it timedout, dmesg didnt show anything wrong =S, any ideas?
22:02  macius: macbook pro 5,5 = the computer im using
22:02  Tomis: if the optical can't ready any known working disks, take the machine in for servicing mac-mini 
22:02  bdelin88: Tomis: I'll look into that... I am a noob to mac fixin's - pro at windows
22:03  macius: since im about 100% sure its a hardware error, does warrenty cover this?
22:03  bdelin88: Tomis: what is SMC
22:03  macius: Tomis: kk ill do that
22:03  Tomis: yes macius 
22:03  Tomis: the power management system bdelin88 
22:03  Tomis: might try also resetting PRAM
22:03  bdelin88: Tomis: thank you
22:03  Tomis: these are just generic trouble-shooting steps
22:04  spline: it's the control alt delete of osx
22:04  Tomis: when in a "wtf i don't know" situation, i just go down the list
22:04  Tomis: what is spline 
22:04  Tomis: cmd-option-esc is force quit
22:04  spline: pram flash and 
22:04  Tomis: how so?
22:04  spline: oh no I mean what you said about "it tends to fix things"
22:04  spline: like a reboot does on windows
22:04  Tomis: oh oh, gotcha
22:04  spline: when I have had odd hw  issues, you know?
22:04  spline: you zap the pram, reset the SMC
22:04  Tomis: yea right
22:05  spline: if it doesn't get fixed, something much worse is wrong
22:05  Tomis: liek a magic incantation
22:05  spline: seriously
22:05  spline: heh
22:05  Tomis: most of the time it doesn't help
22:05  Tomis: but it doesn't hurt to try it
22:05  zer0her0: "PRAM Resets and other Placebos"
22:05  Tomis: Place Boss!
22:06  zer0her0: o.O
22:16 --- MrUnagi_ is now known as MrUnagi
22:18  Cam: How do I make an installer package run a script as it is installing
22:21  Cam: Anyoneee??
22:29  exitcode1: Cam, er... you just set up a pre-flight script to fork and run in the background?
22:29  Cam: Ok.
22:30  exitcode1: Cam: must say though, I'm intrigued as to what reason you'd have for doing that, heh. might do better to ask in #macdev (but be polite, they're a cranky bunch)
22:39  AxonetBE: somebody who knows how to change the licence name for office 2011 
22:39  AxonetBE: ?
22:55  lindsaymobil22: My iMac is not powering on...help?
22:56  Tsavo: Did you try all the obvious things like making sure it's firmly plugged in and it is plugged into an outlet that works?
22:56  lindsaymobil22: Tsavo, yes, all that is fine
22:56  Tsavo: Just had to check ;)
22:56  lindsaymobil22: I power it on, it bongs, then cuts out
22:57  Tsavo: is a normal bong noise?
22:57  lindsaymobil22: Tsavo, yeah, the normal bong, then it cuts out
22:57  lindsaymobil22: Sometimes it makes it to the apple logo for OS X, but rarely not
22:58  cobra-the-joker: lindsaymobil22 , what version of imac ?
22:58  Tsavo: Can you try booting from the Install disk?
22:58  lindsaymobil22: cobra-the-joker, A G5
22:59  lindsaymobil22: Tsavo, No, it takes the disc, bongs, then cuts out and ejects it
22:59  Angostura: TRied reseting PRAM?
22:59 --- Brisk` is now known as Brisk
22:59  spline: ouch
22:59  spline: if you can't read the disk, could try and boot via an image'd usb drive
22:59  spline: that doesn't work, something is fried
23:00  Angostura: Well, let's try resetting PRAM first
23:00  Tsavo: maybe the capacitors exploded and dripped acid allover something importanat
23:00  lindsaymobil22: I cant reset the pram
23:00  Angostura: lindsaymobil22: Because?
23:01  lindsaymobil22: Angostura, i cant get my mac to boot up that far
23:01  Angostura: Let's try resetting the PMU then
23:01  Angostura: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1767?viewlocale=en_US
23:01  spline: thought the pram was 10 second unplug
23:01  spline: and hold the mac key down?
23:01  spline: if you can't get that far, that sounds like a hw issue
23:02  spline: only thing I know that can test there is an ASR cd the stores have or you can find on the net
23:02  lindsaymobil22: Can i say, this was a test! I was testing your tech skills, right now, its the logic board
23:02  spline: heh
23:02  spline: sounds like it
23:02  spline: you'd get the same response on a PC with a bios
23:03  Angostura: lindsaymobil22: if you can get to a bong, you can reset PRAM
23:03  cobra-the-joker: lol 
23:03  spline: unless someone put a locker on the board and caused the thing to short a pin or two
23:03  lindsaymobil22: Well just testing you guys out, i have seen this scenario more than once
23:03  lindsaymobil22: :)
23:03  spline: I see
23:04  spline: well most mac users know how to reset the pram/smu, but I don't think they understand what/why 
23:05  lindsaymobil22: its been a while since i reset the PRAM on a mac
23:05  Angostura: spline: Because in 10% of cases it is worth trying before saying "It's the logic board - you're screwed"
23:06  spline: yeah, I was the first line medic for a friend's father who owned a G3 clamshell that was a few years old
23:06  Angostura: lindsaymobil22: So just to be clear, you haven't actually got a problem, it it was just a pop quiz?
23:06  spline: soldered ram on the motherboard, yeah!
23:06  spline: well there is not much else you can do, that I know of. it's not like there is a generic BIOS that could be tested via a port80 or some other sophisticated tool
23:06  lindsaymobil22: Angostura, sort of
23:07  spline: or where you get "check lights" such as a dell server and other IMPI/integrated and higherend components have to see what might be going wrong
23:07  Angostura: lindsaymobil22: So that's a "yes" then. Sheesh
23:07  spline: even going target drive on the smc requires the "post" or whatever apple calls it to clear
23:08  spline: hard to learn about this stuff since it's apple internal. there used to be a guy here in #mac that did hardware work or something where he knew a bit about it
