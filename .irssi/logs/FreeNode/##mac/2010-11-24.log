00:35  seanthegeek: I was in ssh, and all of the sudden my backspace key now deletes the key in front of the curser. Help?
00:36  yazdmich: thats what backspace does in a text based environment, right?
00:37  seanthegeek: No. That's what the delete key would do on a full keyboard. I think the issue is on the remote end though

02:31  salamandyr: wow, just tried running my i7 imac in 64-bit mode, and it was slower than molasses
02:33  salamandyr: anyone have any idea why that could be?
02:36  S_SubZero: hmm.. I run my mbp with the 64-bit kernel and it seems ok
02:48  salamandyr: is it possible my RAM isn't rated for 64-bit?  or the config is set up wrong?
02:51  salamandyr: dd discover that an Apogee Duet isn't 64-bit compatible
02:53  S_SubZero: RAM isn't bit-picky in that sense
02:53  salamandyr: doesn't need ECC then
02:54  salamandyr: booted into 64 mode with Duet attached.. no sound and a crashed sound driver.. and slooooow leopard.    rebooting w/o Duet was another Slow Leopard.
02:55  S_SubZero: do you have other software running?
02:55  salamandyr: no, this is on boot, with minimums running
02:55  salamandyr: takes several secs for the menus to respond, eetc
02:56  S_SubZero: and going back to 32-bit clears all that up?
02:56  salamandyr: yup
02:57  S_SubZero: maybe it's a driver issue
02:57  salamandyr: maybe i have to actually uninstall the apogee driver 
02:58  Not_the_NSA: I just deleted all my of messages from OS X Mail (Gmail IMAP). They're not on gmail.com anymore either...is there anyway to get them back?!? (I don't even have a backup of my library...backup program wasn't set to back it up)
02:59  rustymyers: that sucks

03:00  S_SubZero: imap is server storage-based, so when you delete something, it's deleted off the server.  Check the trash as noted.
03:00  rustymyers: I did that the other month on my exchange server
03:00  rustymyers: deleted around 4k messages
03:15  rredd4: any one know how to make my netgear router not interfere with channel 4 tv?  tried different channels on the router, did not work
03:16  rredd4: when i d/l files to my mac, i get random snow on the tv
04:04  Third3ye: Hey there :) I got some issues with my Mac -- like for instance I have this Mini Displayport to HDMI and it works just fine on the television, with the exception of the fact that the desktop size overflows the TV screens, and I do mean TV screens as this can be reproduced on another television -- It might have to do with SwitchResX, as I had problems setting a higher resolution on the TV screen before I installed it
04:04  Third3ye: I have a LCD HD TV that supports up to 1080p
04:05  Third3ye: and a Mid-2010 MacBook (MacBook7.1 if that means anything to anyone...)
04:39  funyun: does anyone here use mkvtoolnix? i just downloaded it but i cannot get it to open. any ideas?
04:43  Third3ye: Run it via terminal to see if there's any crash messages? :P

05:09  EdLin: what's a program that will reset playback of internet radio from snowtape to iTunes? I deleted snowtape...
05:10 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
05:11  Kasm279: EdLin: what?
05:11  EdLin: Kasm279:  I need to get itunes to play plz files from firefox.
05:12  Kasm279: right click a pls file in findfer
05:12  Kasm279: change the opening app to iTunes
05:12  EdLin: Kasm279: it thinks it needs to still hand it off to snowtape, and never even gets to the file dialogue.
05:12  Kasm279: then click apply to all
05:12  EdLin: Kasm279: the problem is I can't download a pls file, as it gets intercepted.
05:12  Kasm279: go into firefox prefs then
05:12  EdLin: Kasm279: should I make an empty pls file?
05:13  Kasm279: go into the firefox prefs and look for some setting there
05:13  Kasm279: i know opera has one...
05:14  EdLin: Kasm279: I think I found it
05:14  EdLin: Kasm279: thanks
05:15  Third3ye: Hey, where can I find the display configuration files?
05:15  Kasm279: Third3ye: why do you need to? o.o
05:16  Third3ye: Well after using switchresx the display configuration tool has been rendered useless
05:17 +Tomis: gonna blow 'em away?
05:17 +Tomis: i doubt it would help anymore than just clicking detect displays
05:17 +Tomis: try using fsevetner.app, 3rd party
05:18  Third3ye: It pops up two configuration windows and (apparently for two screens since I have an HD, but it's disconnected from the screen, even the wire is taken out, and the window it self is blank, apart from) a resolution change popup urgint to change to the resolution "800x600"
05:19  Third3ye: and even ignoring that, and trying to change the resolution to anything else leads to a 800x600 resolution
05:19  Third3ye: or wait, it's even worse: 640 x 400 or something like that
05:19  Third3ye: So I wanna wipe the config files, or anything related to the handling of screens and resolution to reset it all to default
05:20  Third3ye: So... any ideas?
05:27  Third3ye: Tomis: Where can I find that?
05:27  Third3ye: Tomis: Spotlight comes up empty, so does locate
05:34 +Tomis: fseventer is a 3rd party program, need to download it

05:49  falcom: i know c, c++, java, and perl
05:49  falcom: but what else
05:54  Third3ye: Would reseting the SMC work?
05:57 +Tomis: what's resetting the SMC have to do with deleting some files Third3ye ?
05:59  Third3ye: Well it's not a question of deleting some files... if you scroll some up you can see my problem is that my display configuration is botched
05:59  Third3ye: I can't change to any other display but 640 x 420
05:59  Kasm279: Third3ye: no that won't help
05:59  Third3ye: The screen configuration window pops up two configuration windows for two screens, but one is blank, yet both suggests changing to 800 x 600
06:00  Third3ye: Which is a dirty LIE!!1!!1 since it only gives me 640 x 420
06:01  Third3ye: As long as I leave the settings alone my screen will remain in 1280 x 1024
06:01  Third3ye: but that won't due if I'm adjusting the settings to an HDTV, as it will reset both screens so an incredibly low resolution
06:01  ideaz_: Guys, quick question - is it really worth spending that much on apple's keyboard and might (wired) mouse?
06:01  ideaz_: your personal experiences welcome...
06:02  Third3ye: and as if that wasn't enough, when I plug my mini-displayport to hdmi wire to my television I do get 1080p, but the desktop viewport is bigger than the actual screen, even if I turn the resolution down
06:02  Third3ye: So I'm guessing it's the display configuration settings that have gone crazy
06:03  Third3ye: So what's your suggestion, Kasm279 and Tomis?
06:03  Kasm279: did you repair permissions?
06:04  Third3ye: Repair permissions? I have no idea what you mean by repair permissions -- but to clarify I can change resolutions using SwitchResX, which I've uninstalled since it's commercial...
06:05  Third3ye: which should imply that the permissions are ok, as it doesn't do anything wrong unlike the standard display config tool
06:05  Kasm279: Third3ye: boot from the system DVD, open disck utility, run repair disk and then repair permissions
06:05  Third3ye: Alright
06:10 +Tomis: if you like the look, yes ideaz_ 
06:10 +Tomis: otherwise, no
06:11  ideaz_: Tomis: I have read good reviews about their keyboard and i feel it would be worth it.
06:11  ideaz_: about mouse, I like the design of the mighty one, but its got equally bad reviews
06:14 +Tomis: their mice are always poorly designed crap
06:14 +Tomis: not poorly built mind you, poorly designed
06:14 +Tomis: the scroll nipple was one of the worst design ideas..
06:15  Tsavo: I ruined my scroll nipple by cleaning it 
06:15  Tsavo: running it really fast upside down to get the debris out
06:15  Tsavo: Bad design flaw. now it only scrolls up
06:19  zer0rez: apple mice dept A- in design F-- in usability
06:20  zer0rez: for every mouse except the original
06:20  ideaz_: yeah
06:21  ideaz_: so I think I will hold off on the mouse but go for the keyboard
06:21  ideaz_: although those keyboard usb ports again not very useful
06:21  Tsavo: The keyboard is excellent
06:21  Tsavo: No they are not
06:21  ideaz_: yeah
06:21  ideaz_: and any suggestion for laptop stand?
06:21  zer0rez: i wish they'd upgrade them to 2.0 USB
06:21  ideaz_: i hv got a macbook pro
06:22  ideaz_: yeah me too
06:22  Tsavo: The USB's on the keyboard apparently have enough juice to charge and sync an iPod shuffle but not enough to mount a flash drive
06:22  zer0rez: i use wire full apple keyboard and magic trackpad on my mac pro
06:22  ideaz_: really?
06:22  zer0rez: i just use built in kb and trackpad on macbook pro
06:22  Tsavo: I'm baffled
06:22  ideaz_: not enough to even power a usb flash drive?
06:22  zer0rez: Tsavo: um what kind of flash drive?
06:22  zer0rez: i'm fine w/ flash drives, albeit slow as hell
06:22  Tsavo: i have a sandisk cruzer
06:23  Tsavo: 4gb
06:23  zer0rez: 2GB model of same
06:23  Tsavo: maybe it's the little light on it that requires too much juice
06:23  zer0rez: and an old 512MB model, both work fine
06:24  ideaz_: apple seems to have forgotten their accessories 
06:24  ideaz_: its time for usb3.0 
06:24  Tsavo: zer0rez: i'm using the new aluminum keyboard. the old white clear plastic one could mount this flash drive
06:25  ideaz_: that was helpful. At least I am sure to buy the keyboard
06:25  zer0rez: Tsavo: weird, i use black, white and aluminum kbd's daily
06:25  ideaz_: i will stick to my microsoft wireless mouse
06:26  Tsavo: I have a MS mouse from our families first computer. still going strong
06:26  Tsavo: it has a big beefy scroll wheel with solid clicks. good for Sauerbraten
06:27  LSD`: I miss the indented scroll wheel from my first MS Explorer. It was great for weapon/inventory selection selection
06:27  ideaz_: haha true

07:32 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
07:33  Third3ye: nvm, found my answer
07:34  andrewfree_: yes.
07:34  andrewfree_: would be the answer.
07:41  Third3ye: andrewfree_: it does? Mine was "no" :S
07:42  Third3ye: Apple and OWC says 4GB is max, or "up to"
07:42  Third3ye: I guess that's a bit ambigous...
07:45  andrewfree_: oh sorry I thought you said mac book pro
07:45  Third3ye: Here's a question: I'm in the market for an SSD drive for my MacBook, but I haven't gotten in to the performance vs price aspect yet -- has SSD reached a noticable performance peak that dwarves the standard HD in macbooks?
07:49  backupq: hi guys
07:49  backupq: I'm wondering about what's the best way to backup all of my photos to an external harddrive
07:50  backupq: and have my computer backup the new pictures automatic
07:56  Third3ye: backupq: Time Machine?
07:58  backupq: well, maybe not. What i'm really looking for is probably a sync software. So I want my pictures saved in that hard drive in a folder/file format perserving their extensions so they can be used on any other linux/pc etc.. but on the other side, I want the sync software to be able to compare files on my computer and hard drive and copy ones that are are new
07:59  backupq: and it's what I do on my pc, it's just very convenient and time saving, so just looking for the same solution with my mac
08:01  andrewfree_: Third3ye: meh idk.
08:01  andrewfree_: Third3ye: I forget if osx supports that intel utility that basicly keeps the ssds in good condition and preforms tests and such
08:02  Third3ye: You mean trim?
08:03  andrewfree_: god damnit lol. I was like I think its trim but I just keep googling about to type in trim..
08:03  andrewfree_: but yes trim.
08:04  andrewfree_: Im not sure if osx uses it yet. What I could suggest, is remove optical drive, and get a small SSD and put just your home folder on it, or just your os on it and you home folder on your other one
08:04  andrewfree_: and you will get epic proformance
08:06  Third3ye: oo :P
08:06  Third3ye: Here's another question
08:07  Third3ye: What's the beef between Apple and Adobe?
08:08  Third3ye: backupq: I think you'd maybe want to setup an rsync service
08:09  Third3ye: There's an rsync client for OS X called arSync, and you can get it here -> http://arrsync.sourceforge.net/
08:09  Third3ye: Wanna know what rsync is? http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/
08:11  andrewfree_: Third3ye: have you looked at the last security update?
08:11  andrewfree_: half of that shit is for adobe products
08:12  andrewfree_: apple wont open up APIs for GPU accel (previously, I think they did now) for flash to run faster
08:12  backupq: but is there a front end gui to rsync?
08:12  andrewfree_: for a ton of reasons, they dont want it on their mobile platform so thats another one. Third3ye 
08:12  Third3ye: backupq: that's what arrsync is :)
08:12  LSD`: Adobe were taking their sweet time in enabling GPU accleration in Flash as well
08:13  backupq: ok let me check
08:13  Third3ye: Plus never releasing the SDK for the current version of Flash for mobile devices
08:13  andrewfree_: apple doesnt want an sdk for it
08:13  andrewfree_: apple doesnt want it on their devices at all
08:13  Third3ye: No, no.. i'm just dragging adobe in the mud some ^^
08:14  torchie: flash is bullshit
08:14  LSD`: andrewfree_: which is a good thing, all told
08:14  torchie: except for the part where you need it to run homestar runner
08:14  andrewfree_: indeed
08:14  Third3ye: Yeah, I've been expecting the death of flash
08:14  torchie: it's kind of hard to kill flash completely because
08:14  andrewfree_: OH
08:14  andrewfree_: one more thing
08:14  andrewfree_: photoshop uses old as fucking code from before osx 10.2 like carbon shit.
08:14  Third3ye: Baring Web3D and SVG support, not to mention the ACID3 tests
08:14  torchie: before it was used for delivering videos, it was kind of like
08:15  andrewfree_: all of the cs5 stuff does
08:15  torchie: the base of all rich internet content
08:15  torchie: or something silly like that
08:15  LSD`: Third3ye: most of the current problems with flash stem from it being used in ways it was never meant to
08:15  Third3ye: LSD`: True, but it just does to show what people think about technicians intentions
08:15  andrewfree_: basicly adobe is lazy.
08:15  Third3ye: "Oh this is a wheel you say, well now it's a frizbee"
08:15  torchie: well it's not like they have a reason to not be lazy
08:16  Third3ye: Yeah, top of the hill and all that
08:16  LSD`: Anyone know if there are any serious plans to fold some standard for vector graphics/animation into HTML5?
08:17  torchie: apple should put the fire under their asses and wreck their junk at image editing software or something
08:17  Third3ye: Ofc, LSD` 
08:17  torchie: SVG :D?
08:17  Third3ye: But, as all web standardizations it's going SLOOOOOW
08:17  Third3ye: Mozila 4 supports SVG I think
08:17  torchie: yeah HTML5's not even done yet
08:17  Third3ye: with JavaScript goodness
08:18  Third3ye: That means using the whole viewport, not to mention not sacrificing googles robots for stupid binary code, or make a workaround
08:20  Third3ye: No need for an SDK, or any of that anti-web bullcrap
08:21  Third3ye: backupq: scratch that app
08:21  Third3ye: backupq: it's old, outdated, and may wipe your stuff
08:21  torchie: what app
08:21  torchie: arrsync?
08:22  Third3ye: Yeah
08:22  torchie: cuz I use that sometimes :o
08:22  torchie: the interface is mad inefficient
08:22  Third3ye: I saw, it looked nice
08:23  backupq: Third3ye: well, it seems that it's a huge app, so what other alternative would you recommend?
08:23  Third3ye: But upon reading some posts on their sourceforge page it doesn't seem to be the best solution
08:24  Third3ye: Well rsync is definetly the best solution - you could configure it manually and install it via port :P but that might be to much, one sec..
08:24  Third3ye: or don't.. it's apparently bundled with OS X
08:25  Third3ye: http://alex.turnlav.net/yarg/
08:25  Third3ye: :P
08:26  Third3ye: Yaaarg!

08:30  backupq: http://mac.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/SyncTwoFolders-Screenshot-22338.html
08:30  backupq: this sounds good to me ;)
08:30  LSD`: It'll have an App Store and support full-screen apps, neither of which will be compulsory
08:31  Third3ye: It does, backupq ^^
08:32  torchie: go fullscreen or go home
08:35 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
08:36  Third3ye: So what about the upcoming local client of the app store?
08:37  Third3ye: oh and btw, that one feature... "Launchpad".. yeah, truely uncreative
08:37  Third3ye: Basically the same functionality as "Launchpad" from Gnome (Linux)
08:38  Third3ye: ehr.. "Unity"
08:42  andrewfree_: wtf is launch pad, either way lion looks epicly lame. I <3 the internal under the hood upgrades.

08:44  andrewfree_: mac is turning into that os that people claim it is now
08:45  S_SubZero: oh no, it will have a package man... app store.  How horrific
08:45 --- Bensawsome is now known as Guest68790
08:46 --- Guest68790 is now known as Bensawsome
08:47  LSD`: I like the idea of full screen apps, providing Apple provide some degree of resolution independence with it as well as app developers doing more with it than simply run existing UIs maximised instead of rethinking their UIs to take full advantage
08:47  torchie: first they're gonna app store then they're gonna lock the computer down and then omg omg fud fud
08:48  torchie: fullscreen is gonna be the jam
08:54  torchie: will sideloading ever come to iOS :(
08:56  S_SubZero: I installed Air Sharing for the rare moment I thought I'd want to use my iPhone as a storage device, but even that seems too clunky so I just carry a USB stick
08:59 +Tomis: they're just backporting iOS stuff to the mac andrewfree_ 
08:59 +Tomis: everyone's making a bigger deal out of it than it is
09:02  andrewfree_: Tomis: if they keep it up im just going to swtich to linux, I dont like the simplicity like that
09:02  LSD`: OS X will have to go a long way downhill because I consider going back to Linux
09:04 +Tomis: keep what up andrewfree_ 
09:05 +Tomis: adding more stuff you don't have to use?
09:05  hekin:  I was trying to upgrade my iPad to iOS 4.2, but the computer powers off during the upgrading, now the ipad is not responding, what am I going to do?
09:05 +Tomis: only thing i don't really like abut 10.7 so far is that they removed the "running" lights from the dock
09:06 +Tomis: but i'm sure there will be a defaults write to bring them back, so no biggie
09:06 +Tomis: restore it hekin 
09:06  hekin: Tomis, how?
09:06 +Tomis: in itunes
09:06  Third3ye: I waaas actually considering PinguyOS
09:06  Third3ye: http://pinguy-os.sourceforge.net/
09:07  hekin: Tomis, itunes can not recognize the plugged in iPad
09:07 +Tomis: um, ubuntu is supposed to be linux for the masses
09:07  LSD`: Tomis: except it's not, heh
09:07 +Tomis: then these guys should help them out
09:07 +Tomis: they don't need yet another fork that no one will use
09:07  LSD`: Ubuntu is still wrapped up in the political BS that's held Linux back forever. Mint is closer, but it's still not perfect
09:08  Third3ye: Mint is surpassed by Pinguy OS apparently
09:08 +Tomis: boot the ipad in recovery mode hekin 
09:08  Third3ye: My problem with Linux is it's inability to maintain stable settings so in the future they can be reverted
09:08 +Tomis: this blog post seams to cover the steps.. http://apple-ipad-tablet-help.blogspot.com/2010/02/how-to-fix-iphone-with-recovery-mode.html
09:09  hekin: Tomis, my iPad doesn't respond to no matter what I did
09:10 +Tomis: then take it to apple, and tell them to fix their broken shit, it's their fault
09:10 +Tomis: so you can't boot/reboot the ipad?
09:11  hekin: Tomis, yes
09:11  hekin: I tried every button I can find
09:12 +Tomis: you hold the sleep/wake button and the home button
09:12  Third3ye: There's a reset sequence apparently
09:12 +Tomis: to force it to reboot
09:12  hekin: how?
09:12 +Tomis: then hold the other combo to put it into recovery mode
09:13  hekin: I tried the combo, (Home + Reset) button
09:13  hekin: no reponse
09:13 +Tomis: then i'd take it to apple
09:14 +Tomis: go through their troubleshooting steps at http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3274
09:14  hekin: Tomis, thanks a lot
09:14 +Tomis: and if you can't get it to a working state, then take it into apple and demand they fix it
09:14 +Tomis: i'd be pissed
09:15 +Tomis: doesn't matter if the computer shuts off in the middle of a software update
09:15 +Tomis: you should still be able to get the device into a recoverable state

09:47  EmilioTucci: I need to check that nothing is doing bad things from my Mac Book, thanks
09:47  S_SubZero: for.. Mac?
09:47  EmilioTucci: yes, for my Mac Book
09:48 +Tomis: macs don't get spyware
09:48  S_SubZero: you can google for that sort of thing, but I dont think you'll find much. 
09:48 +Tomis: also, don't instal pirate sofware and you won't have to worry aobut it
09:49  EmilioTucci: Tomis, that is why I am asking
09:49  EmilioTucci: and there are spyware for Macs
09:49 +Tomis: no
09:49 +Tomis: why do you think the machine has spyware installed?
09:49  EmilioTucci: Ok, so what about "OSX/OpinionSpy"?
09:50  EmilioTucci: Because my Router is being attacked all the time at port 5060
09:50  EmilioTucci: and the DLS cable is unplugged...
09:50  EmilioTucci: so it is coming from within my network
09:50 +Tomis: from the LAN side?
09:50  EmilioTucci: and my Mac is the only one conencted right onw
09:50 +Tomis: what's opinionspy
09:50  EmilioTucci: that is a SpayWare for Mac Os
09:50  EmilioTucci: it's an example
09:50 +Tomis: and how did you conclude you have this
09:51  EmilioTucci: I have not conclude I have that. You said there are no spywares for Mac, and I gave you ONE EXAMPLE
09:51  EmilioTucci: anyway
09:51  S_SubZero: you asked if there was "spyware removal software".  No.  For that one, it's simply done manually. http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100603055412831
09:51  EmilioTucci: About my issue, I need to scan my Mac to see that I have nothing, is there any spyware checker for Mak, etc..?

11:34  Snicksie: i'm not sure whether i gotta ask it here or somewhere else, so if it's the wrong place: let me know ;) ; Is it possible to install plugins or extra syntax-highlighting files to gedit for mac? I already looked in the library folder and in de gedit.app, but didn't found anything yet
11:36  Angostura: Snicksie: Just having a look
11:36  ayaz: Snicksie: Have you had a look at the gedit-plugins package? 
11:36  Snicksie: not yet, ayaz, because i don't use fink or macports, it works crap here :(
11:36  Angostura: What version are you running?
11:37  Snicksie: version 2.30.2 :)
11:39  Snicksie: ah, wait, apparently i found the language files :0
11:39  Snicksie: can i just add it to the package contents and run gedit w/out problem? :p
11:40  Angostura: Snicksie: Looks like the plugins are hanging out in ...
11:40  Angostura: Contents/Resources/lib/gedit-2/plugins
11:40  Angostura: I'd try popping one in there and see if it shows up
11:42  Snicksie: just copy-paste should work, Angostura ?
11:42  Angostura: copy-paste?
11:43  Snicksie: well, copying a plugin and paste it in there :)
11:43  Angostura: If you have a plugin handy, I'd just drag it to the folder
11:43  Snicksie: i love the class browser plugin, but it's not standard implemented
11:43  Angostura: OS X doesn't have the concept of copying and pasting files
11:44 * Angostura slaps self
11:44  Angostura: Yes it does. 
11:44  Angostura: Just not cut & paste
11:45  Angostura: anyway just place a copy of the plugin into the folder, run the app, see what happens and whether the plugin can be enabled under Preferences
11:46  Snicksie: well, he sees there is a plugin named class browser
11:46  Snicksie: i can't enable it though :(
11:48  Angostura: Perhaps you could examine the source of the installed plugins using a text editor and see if there is any particular Mac magic in there - you may be able to edit the one you want to use 
11:48  Snicksie: :p
11:48  Snicksie: hm, might be because i don't have ctags?
11:49  Snicksie: could that be possible?
11:50  Angostura: I have no idea, since I don't know what a ctag is :-)
11:50  Snicksie: ^^
11:50  Snicksie: has something to do with that plugin
11:54  katom: hi, any 1password user around?
12:08  Snicksie: Angostura, apparently i'm missing a python package or so...
13:36  kateweb: why would edit smart playlist be grayed out in itunes?
13:38  Snicksie: do you have a smart playlist, kateweb ?
13:39  Snicksie: i guess only existing smart playlists can be edited
13:39  kateweb: yeah it's one i have had for a wile 
13:39  kateweb: kinda odd realy
13:40  theworkpatrol: might be greyed because it's unusable, perhaps an older version of a playlist that needs to be updated?
13:40  kateweb: heem
13:40  kateweb: i'll take a look
13:49  Angostura: kateweb: It's greyed out when you right-click on the playlist?
14:06  roxlu: hi! 
14:06  roxlu: Does someone knows where I can set which SMTP server my mac must use when using php mail() function?
14:28  topriddy: quick command to unzip a file *.zip in mac please?
14:29  Angostura: double-click on it
14:29  Angostura: no?
14:37  ayaz: topriddy: Or, the unzip command on the Temrinal.
14:37  topriddy: yeah,,,seems the zip was corrupt...thanks guys
14:38  kateweb: it was

14:56  seivan: When getting a new Macbook (air) should I charge it before using it, or whats the best practice regarding battery
14:58  Angostura: Probably best to charge it.
14:58  Angostura: The thing will probably be mostly charged anyway
14:58  theworkpatrol: You don't need to charge LI-Ion batteries when they're new.
14:58  theworkpatrol: You can just start using.
14:59  Angostura: Then a few charge, discharge cycles to get the calibration right
14:59  seivan: http://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html
14:59  seivan: Be sure to fully charge your portable when you plug it in for the first time,
14:59  seivan: But I am not sure what that means
14:59  seivan: Can I use it at the same time
14:59  seivan: or should it stay shut down, and charge for... how many hours?
15:00  Angostura: I'd be happy to have it plugged in and using it

16:22  PeaMan: kamol: are you using a LAMP stack? Such as XAMMP or MAMP?
16:22  kamol: nope, just standard mac ox installation
16:23  PeaMan: You will need to recompile php and enable mcrypt
16:23  PeaMan: Check your php.ini, you might only need to uncomment a line. Unsure though.
16:25  kamol: seems it is ok now, had to install some development version of java, and install php5-mcrypt from port itself and manually copy mcrpit.so file to proper place :)
16:25  kamol: :PeaMan tq, btw, I am very glad for Your response :)
16:25  PeaMan: I had the same issues, I just use MAMP now, much easy for the development machine.

16:29  kamol: yeah, but for production, and requirements to use standard mac os Web services - it is nice challenge :)
