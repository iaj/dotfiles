08:51  canplay: hey ppl
08:53  canplay: ok bit of a party in here?
09:11  MysteryX: I have a 16:9 monitor on my macbook - is there a way to change resolution to a 4:3 one, and have black bars appear to the left and right of the screen? I need that to play 4:3 games. Thanx
09:21  S_SubZero: my MacBook Pro offers resolutions that are off-standard.
09:21  Branes: MysteryX: Unfortunately not
09:21  Branes: Resolution change is possible, aspect ratio is not
09:21  MysteryX: thx
09:21  MysteryX: a piece of software perhaps could be written for this, no?
09:22  Branes: If Apple actually allowed people to modify their code, possibly.
09:22  S_SubZero: I don't know how it works with monitors, but my MBP has a 16x10 screen and I am offered 4:3 resolutions.  When I choose one (ie. 1600x1200) I get black borders.
09:24  MysteryX: aha, a better monitor could be what I'm looking for
09:24  S_SubZero: some monitors have their own scaling, you may want to check yours
09:26  MysteryX: thx
09:26  MysteryX: byw
10:23  iaj: can I reset my search when browsing through the finder - eg when I've accidentally typed 'a'   to make it 'b' instead?
11:09  iaj: thats a no i guess :)
11:09  eagles0513875: iaj: all you need to do is remove the a and type in b
11:09  eagles0513875: and hit enter to restart the search
11:14  iaj: enter will restart the search?
11:14  iaj: enter will rename the file imo
11:14  HackeMate: can office open odt files with some plugin?
11:20  iaj: eagles0513875: :)
11:20  Millsie: HackeMate: http://www.windowsreference.com/ms-office/how-to-open-odt-files-in-microsoft-word-20072003/
11:20  eagles0513875: HackeMate: not sure if the mac version 2011 can but i know for 2010 on win it can 
11:20  eagles0513875: iaj: did it work
11:20  HackeMate: I have the version 2008
11:20  HackeMate: Thanks Millsie 
11:21  Millsie: HackeMate: you could just save as .doc as OOo and MSOffice can open it
11:21  iaj: eagles0513875: nah. because when I search in finder (I mean the simple search when Im viewing a folder and want to quickly find a directory within that folder) enter is replacing the filename of the folder/file I'm currently on.
11:22  eagles0513875: type it in the search bar up at the top right 
11:22  eagles0513875: and then it will ask you what location this mac or in a particular folder
11:27  Qualcuno: hello
11:28  Qualcuno: I'm trying to use Facetime for Mac because I need to make a video call. I am currently connected to the internet using a 3G usb key (and the network is fast: I can use HSPA). However, Facetime refuses to make the call, saying it requires wifi... how can I solve this problem?
11:34  HackeMate: Millsie: I'm getting crazy, I don't find the link in that website to download the plugin
11:34  HackeMate: Just many information about what it is and what openoffice is
11:35  Millsie: it's probably Oracle being silly
11:36  Qualcuno: no one can help me? will we need to "jailbreak" our macs too now? :)
11:39  Angostura: Qualcuno: It's a beta, they don't want people using weird configs and then complaining about them
11:39  Qualcuno: Angostura: weird configurations..... It's just a 3g data key! lots of people use it... and it's fast, and with unlimited data....
11:40  Angostura: It's a beta. 
11:40  Angostura: But...
11:40  Qualcuno: but?
11:40  Angostura: Why not shove the 3G key into another machine and then share that Internet connection via WiFi?
11:40  Angostura: (as a workaround)
11:41  Qualcuno: 'cause right now I don't have another machine :)
11:43  Angostura: Well, unless you can hack around inside the package or make your Mac think that the 3G is really Wifi, you're screwed
11:43  Qualcuno: well, I'll work out a different solution...
11:43  Qualcuno: thanks
11:43  Qualcuno: bye!
11:58  iaj: eagles0513875: I don't mean the search bar.. I just mean the quicknavigation by entering part of a foldersname in any finder window
12:13  iaj: there must be some kind of way :P
12:14  iaj: escape -_-
12:15  iaj: which office tool do you guys use on mac.. neooffice/openoffice?
12:16  Angostura: MS Office
12:16  quiesce: None, sorry.
12:16  Angostura: But failing that OpenOffice
12:16  iaj: but failing that openoffice
12:16  Angostura: (Not too much point to NeoOffice any more)
12:16  iaj: but failing that openoffice, means?
12:16  Angostura: If I don't use MS Office I use OpenOppice
12:17  Angostura: OpenOffice, even
12:17  Angostura: \
12:18  iaj: is there any good avantage from ms office to openoffice/
12:20  Angostura: Better compatibility, a bit slicker
12:30  Psixerces: office 2011 looks great compared to the previous version
12:30  Psixerces: can finally do things I normally booted into windows for office 2007
12:45  Angostura: I'll probably get it just for Macro compatibility
12:45  Angostura: (still on v.X at the moment)
12:55  ferrico: is it posibble to customiza tcp/ip settings of my wireless connection
12:55  ferrico: by a shell script
12:55  ferrico: in debian exists the /etc/network/interfaces file
12:55  ferrico: i dont know if it is posiblle in Mac OS 10.6
12:55  ferrico: any help will be apreciated
12:59  spline: and OSX has Networking under system preferences
13:00  ferrico: exit
13:00  Angostura: wow
13:17  iaj: whats the cost factor of office2011?
13:22  Millsie: spensive
13:30  winegoddess: im doing a presentation in a couple of hours. i was able to hook my macbookpro up to the tv, but not get sound. 
13:32  winegoddess: i believe what i have is a crossover cable
13:32  winegoddess: red and white
13:32  winegoddess: single into my Mac
13:35  thresh: ohai.
13:35  thresh: video editing programs for OSX, anyone? Need to cut parts from H264/AAC files and then merge them together.
13:37  MobGod: imovie ?
13:37  quiesce: QuickTime Pro could handle that.
13:39  thresh: oh, I'd need something free
13:39  thresh: are those free?
13:40  thresh: 30$ for QTP, duh no
13:43  thresh: imovie looks okay, thanks
13:43  thresh: wonder if it supports H264 profile my camera uses :)
13:44  Angostura: Not a nasty Kodak thing, is it?
13:44  thresh: nah, the camera is GoPro HD Hero
13:48  winegoddess: okay - giving up on sounds - think i just need a straight single to single cable
13:49  winegoddess: can i edit multiple master slides in keyote at one? (all same size font for title...) ?
16:08  node808_: Im trying to get to the #macrumors channel on irc.krono.net....does anyone here use that server?
16:10  Phrogz: Anyone know of an API that would let me query the AppStore for all games, finding out title and publisher? And/or can think of a way to hack this? (My 'best' idea so far is doing packet captures to understand iTunes communication, hope it's plaintext, and then spoof my own stepping through pages of results and 'viewing' each app's info.)
16:16  zer0her0: node808_: you may wanna ask on that network
16:17  zer0her0: Phrogz: my guess they'll lock that down pretty quick
16:17  zer0her0: you can prob screen scrape the iTunes store now that it's web based
16:18  Phrogz: zer0her0: I only need access one time, so hopefully they wouldn't notice if I was going slowly. But I think I can't use the web, because I can't use Power Search to get a list of all games.
16:19  LaraX: node808_: I use it but am not there right now
16:19  LaraX: hi zer0her0
16:20  zer0her0: LaraX: hey
16:20  zer0her0: Phrogz: then yes packet cap could work, kind of a hassle to do that.
16:22  Phrogz: For sure :)
17:01 --- DoFoT9_ is now known as DoFoT9
17:05  poppiez: anyone know an application for converting mkv files to mpeg? (freeware)
17:07  Angostura: VLC?
17:08  poppiez: Angostura: can VLC convert?
17:08  matthias-: no
17:09  osxdude: yes it ca
17:09  matthias-: ffmpegX can
17:09  osxdude: n
17:09  Angostura: It can save to a file
17:09  osxdude: VLC can transcode...
17:09  zer0her0: ye
17:09  zer0her0: no
17:09  zer0her0: maybe
17:09  osxdude: yes
17:09  osxdude: ther eis a Transcoding Wizard.
17:09  zer0her0: :)
17:09  Angostura: yup, not idea but if in extremis it works
17:09  osxdude: and I've used it
17:09  matthias-: since what version ?
17:09  osxdude: indeed not ideal
17:10  osxdude: matthias-: forever
17:10  matthias-: ffmpegx ! 
17:10  zer0her0: i've had VERY hit or miss results w/ VLC transcoding wizard
17:10  zer0her0: yea i'd prob suggest ffmpeg/ffmpegx over vlc for video transcoding
17:10  Angostura: zer0her0: Yup, but if it works, it works
17:10  poppiez: ffmpegx. great. thanks guys!
17:12  matthias-: n/p

17:16  joeconyers: also my keybind still works too....
17:16  brocolli: Hi guys, I am wondering how to use 2 different spaces on a dual monitor setup in osx?

17:21  brocolli: Does anyone here use dual monitors with OSX? I wanted help using spaces
17:21  fleebailey33: 3> zer0her0 
17:21  fleebailey33: brocolli: i do
17:21  brocolli: zer0her0: yteah. I just said that was what I was gonna say before he kept spamming (as in I wanted to just state my "specs")
17:21  zer0her0: brocolli: i use dual monitors but hate spaces
17:22  brocolli: I am really beginning to hate it
17:22  matthias-: fleebailey33: that's a shitty mac ;>
17:22  brocolli: because I don't like 1 space for 2 monitors
17:22  brocolli: I was wondering if you can use different spaces on each monitor
17:22  fleebailey33: so get 4 monitors
17:22  fleebailey33: brocolli: not that i am aware of
17:22  brocolli: That wouldn't fix the problem, it would just map 1 space to 4 screens
17:22  brocolli: Ok is there any NON space solution that can do that?
17:25  brocolli: How does one do dual monitor screenshots
17:25  fleebailey33: take a screen shot?
17:25  brocolli: That does one screen
17:25  brocolli: You don't have dual monitors, do you?
17:25  fleebailey33: brocolli: select the whole area
17:26  fleebailey33: use 4 instead  of 3
17:26  fleebailey33: brocolli: your right
17:26  fleebailey33: i use 4
17:26  fleebailey33:  shift + 4
17:26  fleebailey33: select over all screens
17:26  fleebailey33: but dont listen to me
17:27  brocolli: that's what google showed too, but that's not really helpful as I was wondering if there's a keystroke
17:27  zer0her0: command shift 3 should do both screens
17:28  zer0her0: uses the naming scheme "screen shot [date] [time].png" on the desktop
17:28  fleebailey33: zer0her0: not in one pic
17:28  zer0her0: oh
17:28  fleebailey33: :)
17:29  zer0her0: photoshop, photoshop elements, pixelmator, gimp, etc is for
17:29  fleebailey33: or
17:29  fleebailey33: 4 and select all
17:29  zer0her0: ok back to work for realz now
17:29  brocolli: zer0her0: I was thinking that too, but it doesn't work
17:30  zer0her0: thinking what too/
17:30  brocolli: that command shift 3 should do it , but it doesn't. Guess you gotta select all
17:31  zer0her0: brocolli: i just did it
17:31  zer0her0: i do it all the time
17:31  zer0her0: their will be a second file called "screen shot [date] [time] (2).png"
17:31  zer0her0: that's the secondary display
17:32 * CEnTR4L is playing "Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)" by James [4:29/931kbps]
17:33  brocolli:  oh snap zer0her0 I just asw that file
17:33  brocolli: sweet deal :)
17:33  zer0her0: ;)
17:33  zer0her0: it's easy to overlook i was going to mention it previously but thought you wanted one file so i stopped
17:33  zer0her0: ok really gotta get stuff taken care of
17:33  zer0her0: bbl
17:33  brocolli: k
17:42  LaraX: fleebailey33: how was your date?
