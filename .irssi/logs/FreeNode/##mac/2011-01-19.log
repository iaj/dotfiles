02:04  MrUnagi: yup
02:04  ae86-drifter: the user account is bound to AD and apache needs to run as that user or it can't serve certain folders
02:05 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 88 seconds
02:05  iaj: MrUnagi: can you tell me how you did so, I grabbed a 64bit version of macfuse, installed macfusion, but I simply can't even hit the plus button :(
02:05  poggle: wow that is a cool nick
02:05  ae86-drifter: i got ntfs-3g on snow working
02:06  ae86-drifter: don't know which is better to use though, haven't tried macfuse at all
02:07  iaj: grrmm how :\
02:07  ae86-drifter: did u enable it in system prefs?
02:08  iaj: what do you mean by enabling?
02:08  MrUnagi: all i did was install it
02:09  ae86-drifter: yeah well with ntfs-3g after you install you can either enable or disable ntfs support in a pref pane
02:09  iaj: theres not so  much to configure in macfuse itself.. :\
02:09  ae86-drifter: in sys prefs
02:09  iaj: MrUnagi: which version?
02:09  MrUnagi: macfuse isnt the same as ntfs-3g
02:09  MrUnagi: http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/downloads/detail?name=MacFUSE-2.0.3,2.dmg
02:09  ae86-drifter: yeah, i'm not sure about macfuse sorry, have'nt used it!
02:10  iaj: MrUnagi: you installed any filesystems?
02:10  MrUnagi: just installed macfuse and macfusion
02:10  ae86-drifter: there's an alternative if u can't get that to work: http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/ntfs3g.html
02:11 --- mikeplus16 is now known as mikeplus64
02:12  MrUnagi: unless you can mount ftp or ssh as a file system, how is ntfs3g going to work
02:13  ae86-drifter: well i just used finder to browse ntfs
02:13  ae86-drifter: sshfs ?
02:13  MrUnagi: that is where the breakdown is, he mentioned macfusion, which doesnt mount ntfs
02:14  ae86-drifter: i didnt need to mount ftp or ssh as a fs
02:14  ae86-drifter: just ntfs
02:14  MrUnagi: i thought we were referring to iaj 
02:14  gucko: hello people
02:14  gucko: how can I enter binary digits in OS X Calculator?
02:14  MrUnagi: 10101010000101001?
02:15  gucko: MrUnagi: yeah!
02:15  gucko: I can't find a way to enter that!
02:15  ae86-drifter: yeah i was just referring to my past experience with ntfs-3g, i haven't used macfusion or macfuse, you can mount ssh to your local filesystem with sshfs though
02:15  gucko: there's no mode for binary :(
02:15  iaj: Ahhh now its working :)))  Seems like it was a wrong version
02:15  iaj: btw is ftp or ssh faster?
02:16  ae86-drifter: ftp
02:16  MrUnagi: i wouldnt use ftp period
02:16  iaj: no encryption I guess.
02:16  ae86-drifter: ssh is encrypted so it has more overheads
02:16  ae86-drifter: yeah
02:16  gucko:  MrUnagi do you know how?
02:16  MrUnagi: gucko: no
02:16  gucko: Guys you won't believe how happy I'm with my MBP :D
02:16  MrUnagi: i can
02:16  gucko: everything is so clean and beautiful 
02:17  ae86-drifter: MrUnagi: why not FTP? security reasons?
02:17  MrUnagi: thats what she said
02:17  gucko: there are couple things I hate about OS X actually and some times I miss ubuntu :S...will they are:
02:18  MrUnagi: basically
02:18  gucko: 1-There are some stupid things about Finder. Like it doesn't always order icons correctly. Some get above each others! Also why it doesn't show the hidden files!
02:18  MrUnagi: gucko because you didnt enable it
02:18  MrUnagi: and i have never had anything sort wrong
02:18  ae86-drifter: u can enable hidden files 
02:19  gucko: ae86-drifter: I had to do some command line stuff
02:19  gucko: or AppleScript or something
02:19  ae86-drifter: yep so did i
02:19  MrUnagi: so what is the problem
02:19  ae86-drifter: cant remember what it was though
02:19  gucko: will I don't have to do that in Ubuntu
02:19  MrUnagi: !g hidden files finder

02:19  MrUnagi: you have to understand os x caters to the dumb user
02:19  ae86-drifter: you can change the sorting as well
02:20  gucko: MrUnagi: easy man...I'm just pointing some stuff I hate
02:20  ae86-drifter: it will remember next time you goto the folder.
02:20  MrUnagi: gucko: you arent the first, it just gets annoying, it is a different os, catered to different people, but that doesnt mean it is less functional
02:20  gucko: ae86-drifter: I changed sorting, but for example. Suppose I delete some files. I doesn't rearrange the folders. T
02:21  MrUnagi: in what view
02:21  gucko: icons
02:22  gucko: but when I reopen the folder again, they are sorted.
02:22  MrUnagi: i never use icons
02:22  gucko: I don't know but I find that annoying

02:24  ae86-drifter: wtf u can put KDE on mac?
02:24  MrUnagi: no
02:24  MrUnagi: i dunno
02:24  MrUnagi: im being facetious
02:24 +ChrisAM: of course you can.
02:24  ae86-drifter: i suppose that sounds logical, i mean it's available for windows, and mac, being BSD like is alot closer to linux than windows is
02:24  MrUnagi: i just dont see the problem with finder
02:24  MrUnagi: like most new maccers
02:25  ae86-drifter: yeah finder does the job for me, i prefer gnome over KDE anyway
02:25  MrUnagi: ew
02:25  ae86-drifter: never really been a fan of KDE
02:25  MrUnagi: gnome couldnt sort by type last i remember
02:25  MrUnagi: but that was way back
02:25  MrUnagi: that is why i switched to kde
02:25  ae86-drifter: lol really?
02:25  MrUnagi: gnome is quite ugly
02:25  ae86-drifter: it does now definately
02:25  ae86-drifter: KDE reminds me of vista
02:26  gucko: 2-I hate the way windows are managed. I find it so difficult to deal with. You can't know the *active* (not minimized)windows. You have always to hit Expose to know the opened windows. Am I doing it wrong?! In Ubuntu or windows you have everything noted on the panel the bottom. So you know the active windows (maximized) and the minimized windows.
02:26  MrUnagi: i dont run gui on my kubuntu server
02:26  ae86-drifter: my gnome is sexy as hell
02:27  ae86-drifter: i have cairo-dock, widgets, compiz-fusion effects, mac style menus etc
02:27  gucko: ae86-drifter: :D
02:27  gucko: ae86-drifter: are you on a Mac?!
02:27  ae86-drifter: i have a 21inch imac here at work
02:28  ae86-drifter: but my home pcs are win 7 and the other is ubuntu 10.10
02:28  gucko: so any idea about the windows management thing I'm facing?
02:28  MrUnagi: ew windows
02:28  ae86-drifter: its for gaming
02:28  MrUnagi: ps3 is for gaming
02:28  gucko: get an Xbox!
02:28  ae86-drifter: i have a ps3 and 360, lol
02:29  gucko: ae86-drifter: wth!
02:29  ae86-drifter: i just flashed my ps3 with geohot's hacked fw so im playin d/l games on it straight from hdd
02:30  MrUnagi: does that work on the latest firmware?
02:30  ae86-drifter: downloaded and played LBP2 last night
02:30  ae86-drifter: yes, FW version 3.55!
02:30  ae86-drifter: 100% softmod
02:30  gucko: so guys how to quickly switch between opened windows? in ubuntu I have just to click on panel. Here I have to hit expose each time. That's so annoying and not productive
02:31  Colloguy: you could also right click the dock icon
02:31  ae86-drifter: i use ctrl+1,2,3,4,5 etc to change spaces
02:32  ae86-drifter: or set a mouse button or keyboard shortcut to do whatever
02:32  gucko: Colloguy: but that's not quick!
02:32  ae86-drifter: while holding cmd + tab, you can click on the app you want too
02:32  Colloguy: the expose method isn't that bad if you trigger expose using say a screen corner, instead of a keyboard shortcut
02:32  ae86-drifter: that is pretty quick
02:32  gucko: Colloguy: it's like 2 clicks to get to window
02:33  Colloguy: its one click if you assign to screen corner
02:33  Colloguy: and you'll be moving the mouse anyway
02:33  gucko: Colloguy: how to assign to screen corner
02:33  Colloguy: look at the expose control panel
02:33  ae86-drifter: MrUnagi: all u need is a usb drive fat32 then update system software then u can install games for ps3 u download but u have to sign it for the hacked fw if it isnt already
02:34  ae86-drifter: pretty awesome
02:35  gucko: Colloguy: MAAAAN I can't believe it!
02:35  gucko: how awesome is that!!!!
02:35  Colloguy: what?
02:36  Colloguy: you can do the same thing with Compiz
02:37  gucko: really?
02:37  gucko: I mean screen corners?
02:37  Colloguy: yeah
02:38  gucko: didn't know that
02:38  ae86-drifter: lol yeah click on expose & spaces in sys prefs
02:38  gucko: yeah sometimes I think, why would anybody get a Mac?!
02:38  gucko: lol
02:38  Colloguy: apt-get compizconfig-settings-manager
02:41  gucko: Colloguy: what's your way to see active windows?
02:41  Colloguy: expose
02:42  Colloguy: expose only shows the windows in the current workspace, so it's not that cluttered
02:44  gucko: so i solved one thing i hate today
02:45  Colloguy: better put it in your journal
02:45  gucko: :D
02:47  gucko: oh anybody found the solution to enter binary numbers in Calculator?
02:48  Fedayk1n: which calculator?
02:48  gucko: OS X calc
02:48  gucko: the builtin
02:49  ae86-drifter: on ur dash :P

02:49  gucko: Fedayk1n: ok then?
02:49  gucko: there;s no mode for binary
02:50  ae86-drifter: or f4 if you DONT have a macbook lol..
02:50  gucko: only 8 10 and 16 bases
02:54  gucko: Fedayk1n: so?
02:54  allenk: Does organizing files help defragmentation?
02:54  gucko: guys can i eject a volume (USB Flsh..etc) using the keyboard eject button?
02:55  allenk: Like instead of 2000 pictures scambled with all kinds of other file types, all in one folder
02:55  gucko: allenk: I don't think you need to worry about that. The OS X uses a journaling FS
02:57  gucko: clicking that eject button doesn't unmount volumes :(
03:13  luist: what app can i use to resize automatically many images at once? like 50% of the original size
03:13  Fedayk1n: luist: what you're looking to do is called batch processsing
03:13  Fedayk1n: you can do it in any # of apps
03:13  luist: Fedayk1n: like?
03:14  Fedayk1n: iphoto, aperture, photoshop, pixelmator, hell I think even preview will do it

08:10  Kasm279|Away: some*
08:10  Kasm279|Away: night
08:10  Kasm279|Away: if its not command its one of the other two modifiers
08:10  Tomis: you can't rubydiamond , have to remove some
08:11  Kasm279|Away: anyway
08:11  Kasm279|Away: night
08:11  rubydiamond: Tomis: really
08:11  rubydiamond: ?
08:11  Tomis: yes
08:11  rubydiamond: Kasm279|Away: it's not command
08:11  Tomis: after a decade of existance apple still hasn't fixed the clusterfuck that is menuitem management
08:11  rubydiamond: Tomis: how to change their positions
08:11  rubydiamond: I want to get all important ones together
08:11  Tomis: command-click and drag 'em
08:11  Necrosan: Hello there Tomis
08:12  Tomis: that won't work with 3rd party ones though, only native ones, or ones that use apple's private API to be native
08:12  rubydiamond: Tomis: command-click ?
08:12  Tomis: command is the modifier key on either side of the space bar
08:13  Tomis: the clover one
08:15  rubydiamond: Tomis: I hope there is something to move thirdparty menubar apps too
08:15  Tomis: there isn't
08:16  Tomis: tell apple to fix the issue, http://apple.com/feedback
08:16  Tomis: the current solution to that would be to launch the 3rd party ones in a different order
08:17  Tomis: i've stopped running 3rd party menu items, and try to abstain from running background processes in general
08:23  BobbyJr: actually, thats a really good point... Apple definitely need to give us some way of managing menubar items. I love the menubar, I find it insanely handy and I have a ton of stuff up there... but I find myself having to decide which ones are more important to keep just so I can make room. Not good.
08:24  Fedayk1n: uh
08:24  Fedayk1n: most applications have the option for menubar or not
08:25  Fedayk1n: why should apple need to make that yet another thing to worry about
08:25  BobbyJr: yes, and thats one thing Im thankful for. In fact I tend to simply not use apps that don't give the option
08:26  Tomis: the fact that you can't re-arrange 3rd party ones is a major fail
08:26  BobbyJr: agreed
08:42  qpt: how do i navigate to the Desktop from an Open dialog box?
08:42  qpt: stupid question, i know... sorry

08:45  Tomis: or hit cmd-D i think it is
08:45  qpt: i figured it out
08:45  qpt: it's under user/my name/desktop i guess
08:45  Tomis: or go to the desktop in the finder and drag the icon from the window's titlebar into the open dialog to jump to that older
08:45  Tomis: yup
08:46  Tomis: your home folder should be in your sidebar by default anyway, as well as the desktop being there
09:16  blueoyster: hi guys, considering making the jump to mac
09:16  blueoyster: is there really any difference between the current 15" models?
09:16  blueoyster: seems like it's 300$ for a 260Mhz speed bump...
09:19 +Berzerker: the more expensive 15" has a Core i7 vs. a Core i5
09:20 +Berzerker: I personally didn't see the need.
09:20 +Berzerker: System Information: Model: MacBook Pro • CPU: Intel Core i5 M 520 (4 Cores) @ 2.40 GHz • L2: 262.14 KB • L3: 3.15 MB • Memory: 8.00 GB • Load: 0.23 0.25 0.37 • Uptime: 6hours 58mins • Disk Space: Total: 89.68 GB; Free: 32.27 GB • Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M • OS: Mac OS X 10.6.6 (Build 10J567) • Textual: 2.0.2 (Build #8474) (Running for 6hours 57mins)
09:21  blueoyster: what's the diff between an i5 and an i7 though?
09:21  blueoyster: anything?
09:21  S_SubZero: a little faster
09:22  blueoyster: just a snade though, right? 260Mhz?
09:23  S_SubZero: just a snade.
09:23 +Berzerker: no, the i5 to i7 jump is much more than 260mhz
09:23 +Berzerker: but it wasn't worth $300 to me.
09:24  blueoyster: extra 1MB of L3 cache...
09:24 +Berzerker: you can't just look at numbers
09:24 +Berzerker: that's like saying a 3.0GHz Pentium 4 is better than a 2.4GHz Core i5
09:25  blueoyster: so what do i look at
09:25 +Berzerker: you look at comparisons on various websites
09:25 +Berzerker: ones who do actual benchmarks
09:26 +Berzerker: blueoyster: here's a good comparison
09:26 +Berzerker: http://www.barefeats.com/mbpp18.html
09:27 +Berzerker: it's a decent-ish jump, not worth $300

09:29 --- mikeplus64 is now known as Guest90977
09:29  blueoyster: that is a good comparison, thanks!
09:29  blueoyster: seems like the 2.8 kicks the crap out of the rest
09:29  S_SubZero: note the model.
09:29  S_SubZero: They are comparing *iMacs* to *MBPs*
09:29 --- TheNavyBear is now known as 16WAACA78
09:30  LSD`: The 2.8GHz iMac has a desktop chip in it, the mobile one is going to be slower
09:30 +Berzerker: S_SubZero: more noting the i5 and the i7 comparison
09:30  S_SubZero: yeah the core i5/i7s in the MBPs are dual core hyperthreaded models, the iMac uses a pure quad core
09:30 +Berzerker: it's got an i7 930 in it
09:30 +Berzerker: quad-core hyperthreaded
09:31  LSD`: More likely an i7-860
09:31 +Berzerker: it's got hyperthreading
09:31 +Berzerker: it can't be an 860
09:31 +Berzerker: wait, the 860 is hyperthreaded...
09:31 +Berzerker: nvm
09:31  LSD`: i7-860 does have HT, it's the i5-7{5,6}0 that doesn't
09:32  LSD`: ...which is what I believe the 27" model right below it has
09:32 +Berzerker: what speed is it
09:32  LSD`: The 21" models run Clarkdale i5s I believe
09:32  LSD`: i5-750 is 2.66GHz from memory
09:32 +Berzerker: I mean the iMac
09:32 +Berzerker: trying to judge if it's 750 or 760
09:32  LSD`: i5-760 is 2.80GHz
09:33  LSD`: Oh, they've refreshed them to what sound like i5-760 and i7-870
09:33 +Berzerker: the 21.5" model runs either Core i3 and i5
09:33 +Berzerker: and the 27" has a 760 and an 870
09:33 +Berzerker: yeah
09:34 +Berzerker: a 3.6Ghz Core i5?
09:34  LSD`: Clarkdale
09:34  LSD`: i5-6xx
09:34  qpt: anyone here use scribus
09:34  qpt: i just want to create a box with the same color as the background
09:34  qpt: to cover some stuff up
09:34  qpt: this is soooo annoyingly difficult!
09:34  LSD`: 3.6GHz makes it an i5-680
09:34  qpt: isn't there an eyedropper or something
09:35  Angostura: There should be if it uses the standard colour picker

16:55  soahccc: adamfield: but a bit overkill ;) And I tried such a manager but it's not my thing...
16:56  adamfield: soahccc: try clipmenu http://www.clipmenu.com/
16:56  adamfield: minimal, and mapped to shift+cmd+v
16:57  simplicity-: is USERHOST_KEY the way to go, to get ones hostname?
16:58  adamfield: the scripts it can run on pastes are worth it alone, case, crypto, surround, trim. all on paste? epic
16:58  simplicity-: sorry, wrong channel.
17:10  roger_padactor: should i get mac ram from newegg
17:10 +Tu13es: yes
17:10 +Tu13es: no
17:10 +Tu13es: maybe
17:10 +Tu13es: probably
17:11 +Tu13es: RAM is RAM, as long as it's the right type, it probably doesn't matter where you get it
17:11  Brisk: chances are it wont be "magically" better than any other RAM from the known sources, so if it's a good price, then why not?
17:11  adamfield: mac ram - go to OWC
17:11  adamfield: www.macsales.com
17:11 +Tu13es: i usually buy from newegg
17:11  roger_padactor: OWC?
17:12  adamfield: i got a processor upgrade for my old G4 from them
17:12  Brisk: otherworld computer, they're an online Mac and stuff around Macs store
17:12  Brisk: er, computing*
17:14  roger_padactor: thanks.   upgrading some work computers and the difference in price is ridiculous, 
17:15  Brisk: I've also had good experience with Crucial, just to throw out another option. http://www.crucial.com/mac/index.aspx
17:17  adamfield: ive got a quesion for the hardcore macnerds in here actually
17:17  adamfield: ive got an early 08 )pre unibody) MBP
17:17  adamfield: apple spec says it tops out at 4GB ram.
17:17  adamfield: im running 6GB just fine
17:17  adamfield: ...you think 8 would kill me?
17:18  Brisk: I don't think it would recognize 8 GB, as I recall those machines max out at 6 GB.
17:18  Brisk: There's some site that does testing for that, but I can't remember it off the top of my head.
17:20  adamfield: see, the whole 6GB max thing, that seemed to be all pre snowkitty
17:20  adamfield: 4GB ddr2 is expensive, so i dont want to just buy it and not use it
17:21  adamfield: oddly enough - if i put 8GB in it, ubuntu + PAE would recognize it all, even as a 32 bit os
17:23  Brisk: adamfield http://forums.macnn.com/69/mac-notebooks/358184/a-guide-to-macbook-ram-upgrades/
17:25  adamfield: rawr
17:25  adamfield: its time i upgrade anyways
17:25  adamfield: old macbook pro is old
17:25  adamfield: even with 6GB and a big fat SSD
17:25  MrUnagi: adamfield: mactracker
17:25  adamfield: already have it, yeah
17:26  adamfield: i was just curious if anyone bothered using 8
17:26  MrUnagi: doubt it will see it as someone said
17:26  adamfield: again - it was all pre snowkitty, since when SL came out, everybody had a unibody that supported 8GB
17:26  adamfield: really though, ive got 6GB with 3.x sitting unused
17:26  adamfield: no point in having 5.x unused ram
17:27  Brisk: It is useful if you run VMs though. :)
17:27  MrUnagi: or after effects
17:27  Brisk: Heaven knows Safari will eat through it all if you it open, though.
17:27  Brisk: leave it open*
17:29  adamfield: i do use VMs
17:29  adamfield: but, 256MB each
17:29  adamfield: 256 - win7 256 cent0s
17:41  gucko: hi guys
17:42  gucko: can I add an SSD disk instead of the mechanical hd in my MBP?
17:43  Brisk: gucko: yes.
17:43  simplicity-: Yes, gucko.
17:43  gucko: great
17:43  gucko: so it can be as quick as the new Airs
17:43  simplicity-: heh
17:43  Brisk: :)
17:43  simplicity-: Atleast quick.
17:45  Brisk: you can also replace your CD/DVD drive with a HDD, to reclaim storage space (unless you have a thousand to drop on a SSD)
17:45  adamfield: gucko: i have an SSD in my 08 mbp
17:45  adamfield: and i replaced the DVD drive with a 500GB 7200RPM drive lol
17:46  mrapple_laptop: hi - i just changed my password last night
17:46  gucko: adamfield: is it faster now?
17:46  mrapple_laptop: now whenever i try to open terminal, its stuck at 'login'
17:46  mrapple_laptop: ideas?
17:47  adamfield: mrapple_laptop: yes
17:47  mrapple_laptop: adamfield: thank god :P
17:47  adamfield: gucko: yes. its incredibly fast
17:47  adamfield: 10 seconds from power on to desktop
17:47  gucko: great!
17:47  adamfield: mrapple_laptop: lemme find the dir for you
17:48 --- svyatogor is now known as svyatogor|away
17:48  gucko: Brisk: I'm considering the SSD only after a year...will be much cheaper 
17:48  adamfield: ~/Library/Preference/com.apple.terminal.plist
17:48  mrapple_laptop: remove it?
17:48  adamfield: exit terminal. delete that file
17:48  adamfield: reboot if possible
17:48  adamfield: and that should fix terminal
