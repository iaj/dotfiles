09:16  Necrosan: uh

09:21  Necrosan: I don't know man, that sounds awfully tricky
09:21  Necrosan: Is it just a folder you're checking?
09:21  Necrosan: Or the WHOLE COMPUTER?
09:22  q_a_z_steve: Just one file coming from an SBS server.
09:22  Necrosan: Hmm.
09:22  Necrosan: I wish I could be of more assistance

09:23  q_a_z_steve: it's cool
09:23  Necrosan: Although I would surely have the best way figured out if I did...
09:23  Necrosan: Sorry, man
09:23  q_a_z_steve: have you heard of any channels I could try for IRC?
09:23  Necrosan: If I was in OSX I would try some stuff
09:23  Necrosan: Check out ##bash
09:24  Necrosan: ask how they would do it, they should be able to help you come up with something
09:24  Necrosan: Also, I don't even know of cron exists in 10.6
09:24  Necrosan: You might be stuck with Launchd
09:24  Necrosan: or whatever the hell it's called 
09:24  Necrosan: Branes would know
09:25  q_a_z_steve: I have cron set up for bz2 on the file already
09:27  q_a_z_steve: I can probably put the script together, although I'm not great at "first time's a charm" :P the main issue would be Which program can I use, without installing, and technically without going through the company SMTP, i.e. if I need to auth at all that's not optimal. Google let's you send regardless don't they?
09:28  Necrosan: theres command line stuff built in
09:28  Necrosan: if i recall correctly

09:34  cryptics_: so running a bash script through launchd with folder watch and it keeps crashing. any ideas why?
09:35  q_a_z_steve: I don't have server access atm, are we safe to assume "desktop" install would be the same?
09:35  q_a_z_steve: cryptics_ newb question perhaps, what's "folder watch"?
09:35  cryptics_: q_a_z_steve: "folder action" like in automator 
09:36  q_a_z_steve: kk, meanwhile launchd should have a console.log no?
09:37  cryptics_: yes. not helpful
09:37  q_a_z_steve: you mean it doesn't give any crash data?
09:40  cryptics_: none. just says throttling respawn
09:42  q_a_z_steve: not sure how to interpret that. Wonder if it could be turned off in order to give a more definite error...
09:43  Necrosan: check this out cryptics_ http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18277548/13%20I%20Could%20Check.MP3
09:53  cryptics_: q_a_z_steve: lingon set it to queuedirectories which causes it to run if the directory is not empty which it will never be which leads to crashing. changed it to watchdirectory but it won't run through the full loop
09:59  cryptics_: for instance i cp'd 6 files and it copied one the first time and left the others. then i tried again and it copied 3 and left the others

10:15  liquid-silence: cryptics_ what was wrong?

10:16  cryptics_: also there are some switches in the launchd plist for debug etc. helps if you read the man :)

15:33  AntORG: If I wouldn't need it, I wouldn't have noticed
15:33  AntORG: is this something that's covered by applecare? or is it like the batteries that it's expected to fail at some point

19:48  AntORG: linux?
19:48  MrUnagi: yes
19:48  AntORG: what kind of linux?
19:48  MrUnagi: ubuntu
19:49  AntORG: ubuntu should come with byobu, a screen fork
19:49  alexbobP: ubuntu does come with byobu
19:49  MrUnagi: er
19:49  MrUnagi: actually yes os x
19:49  MrUnagi: sorry
19:49  MrUnagi: i am on os x connecting to os x to copy to ubuntu lol
19:50  AntORG: lol ;P
19:50  alexbobP: also byobu's not really a fork... it's more of an addon... thing.
19:50  AntORG: osx comes with screen
19:50  AntORG: connect
19:50  alexbobP: it still uses screen but it gives you a nice menu and a pretty default config
19:50  MrUnagi: so..........screen; scp source dest; exit?
19:50  AntORG: type screen
19:50  AntORG: scp stuff
19:50  AntORG: no, no exit
19:50  AntORG: detach
19:50  AntORG: ctrl+a, d
19:51  MrUnagi: sounds fun lol
19:51  alexbobP: the beauty of screen is that the terminal you create stays put, and you can reattach
19:51  alexbobP: most notably, you can attach over ssh from different hosts and stuff

21:07  nickson75: quick question...
21:07  nickson75: anyone here own apple tv?
21:07  Tomis: no nickson75 !
21:07  Tomis: oh, i'm sure someone probably does
21:08  nickson75: is there a way to watch it without a hdmi connection?
21:08  nickson75: like on a plasma tv?
21:08  Tomis: jut get an adapter
21:09  nickson75: is there really such thing?
21:09  nickson75: Tomis are u pulling my leg?
21:09  Tomis: what's your TV have for inputs
21:09  Tomis: then google for adapters, who knows
21:09  Tomis: also check monoprice.com, newegg.com etc.
21:10  nickson75: it's got your regular audio video and then it's got some others called compponents.
21:10  Tomis: what's "regular audio video"
21:11  Tomis: find out the specific names of the inputs it has, then start lookin for adapters
21:11  nickson75: oh the red, yellow, white connections
21:12  Tomis: ah, composite
21:12  nickson75: I just glanced on that link you provided... you ain't lying
21:12  nickson75: do you think the picture quality will suck ?
21:12  nickson75: by using an adapter?
21:12  Tomis: of course
21:13  Tomis: can't do anything about it though, get a new tv or get an adapter
21:13  nickson75: i'm considering getting an hdtv if the adapters are too expensive
21:13  nickson75: hmmmm...
21:13  nickson75: good point.
21:13  Tomis: yea, i'm seeing adapters for both kinds, the cheepest seam to be around $50
21:13  nickson75: $50 is not bad actually
21:13  Tomis: which is half the cost of the appletv, seam kinda silly
21:13  nickson75: versus a $800.00 hd tv
21:13  nickson75: LOL yeah
21:14  Tomis: and you know you need a new tv anyway
21:14  nickson75: but i love my plasma tv
21:14  nickson75: LOL

Everything works fine on the windows computer in front of me. Any ideas of settings I can change in osx? I enabled smb file sharing, and joined a workgroup in WINS settings. Still no luck.

22:31  simplicity-: yeah about that.. You should have downloaded VLC when it was still in the App store
22:31 +crilly: phidah: Can you import them into iTunes and have it convert them?
22:31  Brisk: lol
22:31  phidah: crilly: Tried dragging them to itunes, didnt work
22:32  neverblue: phidah, dragging them doesn't convert them
22:32  Brisk: try HandBrake / Video Monkey to convert them into an iPad format (Handbrake is cross-platform, Video Monkey is mac only I believe)
22:32 +crilly: phidah: I can only suggest converting them with something. Perhaps VLC or Handbrake?
22:33  phidah: Ok. What format should they be in?
22:35  Brisk: phidah, Lifehacker has some Handbrake presets that should take care of it call (haven't tried them myself, but handbrake is usually good). http://lifehacker.com/5572037/handbrake-presets-for-your-new-ipad-or-iphone-4

23:01  S_SubZero: apparently I'm not hip enough to do Apple certification.  Look at the screenshots. http://training.apple.com/itpro/macinteg/mac_integration_basics_106.pdf
23:01  blackwhite__: is it indexing or something and is there a way I can turn it off?
23:02  simplicity-: I think there's some cleanup scripts running everyday, every week and every month.
23:02  simplicity-: Lol S_SubZero :P
23:02  blackwhite__: is there a way to turn them off?
23:06  neverblue: blackwhite__, you can always view what processes are running
23:06  neverblue: do you use Time Capsule ?
23:07  blackwhite__: neverblue no not on this machine
23:07  neverblue: you could always view which process, at the time it occurs, is running
23:07  neverblue: as it would appear you are using the system when it 'slows down'
23:08  blackwhite__: where do I check that
23:08  neverblue: well, there are various methods
23:08  blackwhite__: terminal?
23:08  neverblue: in both, GUI and in terminal
23:09  blackwhite__: activity monitor?
23:09  neverblue: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Monitor
23:10  blackwhite__: ok 
23:10  neverblue: http://theprimepixel.com/list-of-mac-osx-common-processes <-- supplied at the bottom of the previous URL
23:10  blackwhite__: if I can actually read it when it slows don
23:10  blackwhite__: down
23:10  blackwhite__: thnx
23:13  neverblue: you could also consult your logs
23:14  blackwhite__: yeah
23:14  neverblue: at some point the slow down will stop, right ?
23:14  blackwhite__: let me see what happens at 12
23:14  blackwhite__: yes
