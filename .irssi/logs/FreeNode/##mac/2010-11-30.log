09:10  neataroni: is there a way i can get all the drivers and stuff for windows 7 on my imac without my mac os x install disk?
09:11 +Tomis: borrow someone else's neataroni 
09:56  iaj: is there someone doing latex in here?
09:57  iaj: i got an issue :\   i tried to install via ports - now the mactex package... however I don't get that tlmgr binary on my command line :\
10:17  iaj: thats a  'no one'  i guess :)

10:46  LetsGo67: How do I install OS 7.5?
10:47  LetsGo67: Anyone, please?
10:50  S_SubZero: well, you need a Mac that supports that OS
10:51  LetsGo67: S_SubZero: PowerBook 520 with only floppies?
10:51  S_SubZero: No idea.  You'd likely gleam that data from google.
10:51  LetsGo67: Thanks anyway.
10:54 +Branes: LetsGo67: Nice machine, the PB520.
10:54  LetsGo67: Branes: thanks.  I like it too.  Are you familiar with how to install the system?
10:55 +Branes: Getting software into them can be a pain though, if you don't have a working, semi-decent intermediary Mac of amlost-similar vintage.
10:55  LetsGo67: i.e: Quadra 800?
10:56 +Branes: Or a bit newer (up to the last of the grey G3's). 
10:57  LetsGo67: Not a Blue and White G3?
10:58 +Branes: Basically, you need some way of downloading the System 7.5.3 disk images and the 7.5.5 update disk images from apple.com, and get them over to an old-school Mac with a working 800kb floppy drive *before* you try to uncompress them, and then turn them back into working floppies.
10:59  LetsGo67: Branes, parts 1-17 are downloaded... on the 520.  Any way to transfer the files to Quadra 800?
10:59 +Branes: The aforementioned floppy drive has to be an internal one (as in, shipped with it from the factory), you can't use a USB external.
10:59  LetsGo67: Do I burn the parts to floppies?
10:59  LetsGo67: Do I boot from floppy 1?
10:59 +Branes: Sure. 8-pin to 8-pin serial cable, and turn on AppleTalk in the Chooser.
11:00  LetsGo67: Hmm.  Can't I use the 520's floppy drive?
11:00 +Branes: You need to use Disk Copy to turn them back into floppy disks, then you start off disk 1.
11:01 +Branes: Sure, if you've already got the stuff on the 520, then fire up Disk Copy and get those floppies cranking out :)
11:02  LetsGo67: Okay.  So I download Disk Copy.  I get 17 floppies.  I boot from disk 1.  It will boot from floppy and say "Bienvenue" or something.  And there will be no problem?  I have plenty of 68k, and some PowerPC, but do I need any of them?
11:02 +Branes: You should get the traditional 'Welcome to Macintosh' message, and then it'll go straight to the installer.
11:03  LetsGo67: Branes, sounds good.  So it is a boot disk?  It will also say "please insert disk 2", "please install disk 3"...?
11:03 +Branes: btw, there's a couple of channels on freenode dedicated to antique / vintage Macs: #68kmla and #lowendmac
11:03  LetsGo67: Thanks.  :)
11:05  LetsGo67: I will try that out ASAP.  I'll probably come back for more questions, such as which Web browser is the best?
11:05  LetsGo67: Thanks, and TTYL!
11:05  LetsGo67: :)
11:10  fujisan: i need some help
11:13  fujisan: nobody here?
11:39  clocKwize: hi guys, i've got a USB hard drive that is NTFS, but when i plug it in, it only appears to be readonly? how can I make it writable
11:40 +Branes: Add software to OSX.
11:41 +Branes: Paragon NTFS is commercial, but fast and fully compliant. 
11:41 +Branes: (affordable, though)
11:41 +Branes: MacFUSE, with the additional ntfs-3g module, is free, but some people report problems, and it's not that fast.
11:41  clocKwize: I see
11:42  clocKwize: I only want to back up stuff.. it's not my external drive and I'm just doing it once so I don't want to pay for anything.. I might just connect it to a windows vm and share my folders to the vm from osx :/
11:44 +Tomis: make a sparsedisk image, throw the files in it, send the disk image to the PC
11:44 +Tomis: then you can be sure the resources and permissions are being preserved correctly
11:44 * Branes likes that idea
11:45 +Tomis: better idea, get a backup disk for the mac, set up time machine
11:45  clocKwize: I haven't heard of sparsedisk but I'll be sure to take this route as it sounds sensible :P
11:45  clocKwize: Tomis: I should do this...Just haven't got round to purchasing my own external drive
11:45 +Tomis: you'd create the disk image using disk utility
11:45  clocKwize: is that just a dmg?
11:46 +Tomis: .sparsedmg or something like that
11:46 +Tomis: .sparseimage?
11:46 +Tomis: something along those lines
11:46  clocKwize: ahok, sweet
11:46  clocKwize: found it 
11:47 +Tomis: yea you choose it in the popup menus when creating the disk image
11:47  clocKwize: done :D
11:49  clocKwize: blah, just been roped in to doing a dev talk :/ I *hate* public speaking with a passion.
11:50  iaj: gna I could need some help - is someone doing TeX editing in here?
11:50 +Tomis: type it all up, select all, Speech>Start Speaking
11:50 +Tomis: problem solved clocKwize 
11:50  clocKwize: haha :)
11:50  clocKwize: if only it were that simple :)
11:50  Angostura: clocKwize: Have fun and use Prezi to do the presentation
11:51  iaj: clocKwize: :-)
11:51  Angostura: Makes it a bit livelier than Powerpoint
11:51  clocKwize: I'll take a look at that
11:51  clocKwize: dunno if i'll have slides
11:51  Angostura: http://prezi.com/
11:51  clocKwize: just lots of assembly langauge pictures >.<
11:51  Angostura: Yup - that'll work 
11:51  Angostura: ;_0
11:52  clocKwize: that looks pretty cool
11:53  Angostura: It is. I suspect people will be pretty sick of it in a year. but a the moment...
11:55  clocKwize: hehe
11:55  Angostura: You could probably do something quite cool with it to drill down into bits of sourcecode
11:56  Angostura: Nice for mixing highlevel, lowlevel discussions
11:56  clocKwize: I don't have source code, just disassembled asm which nobody will understand :D
11:59  markasea: This is mac as in Mac users right?
12:00  clocKwize: yes
12:00  markasea: awesome
12:00  markasea: I have a mac hacking pirate tattoo on my arm lol
12:00  markasea: i love mac
12:00  clocKwize: heh
12:00  markasea: I have a question
12:00  markasea: have you heard of REALbasic?
12:00  markasea: now known as REAL studio
12:01  markasea: the language for basic programming
12:01  clocKwize: yes
12:01  clocKwize: heard of
12:01 +Branes: Still going strong after all these years.
12:01  markasea: I've been learning a lot about it and made some apps
12:01  clocKwize: i heard of it about 10 years ago :p
12:01  markasea: would you like to test one
12:01  markasea: lol wow
12:01  clocKwize: not really, I'm busy working 
12:02 +Branes: REALbasic is almost wenty years old.
12:02 +Branes: *twenty
12:02  markasea: I love REALbasic though
12:02  markasea: its so muchfun
12:02  markasea: I wrote a price comparer
12:03  markasea: and some flooders and spammers for facebook/yahoo messenger/icaht
12:03  markasea: etc
12:03  markasea: lol
12:03  clocKwize: why?
12:03  clocKwize: write something constructive..
12:03 +Branes: I had a fiddle with it years ago; preferred HyperTalk, then I pretty much stopped bothering with code. I'm messing with Marten these days, 100% visual programming, no code needed.
12:03  markasea: I did
12:03  markasea: a price comparer :)
12:04  clocKwize: ruby is a good language to learn
12:04  markasea: oh really
12:04  markasea: people always tell me to learn C++, xcode and everythign else
12:04  markasea: but im like
12:04  markasea: why? if realbasic is so much easier, and you can make applictions why
12:04 +Branes: A programming environment that needs long lines of text? Pfft. Sod that for a barrel o' goatse.
12:05  markasea: goatse?
12:05  clocKwize: long lines of text?
12:05 +Branes: Don't ask.
12:05  markasea: i know what it is
12:05  markasea: goat.cx
12:05  clocKwize: goatse.cx
12:05  markasea: aka goatse.cx
12:05  markasea: yeah
12:05  markasea: now its a pumpkin

12:05  clocKwize: my homepage
12:05  markasea: ?
12:06  markasea: oh i see
12:06  markasea: i like your version better then that mans anus
12:07  markasea: anyway
12:07  markasea: does anyone want to test my price comparer tool?
12:07  markasea: thast constructive =D
12:07 +Branes: http://www.andescotia.com/ <- home page for Marten. Give it a try, it's the way programming on the Mac *should* be.
12:07 +Branes: None of this typing reams of nonsensical text into an editor - draw your program, don't write it!
12:08  markasea: Branes
12:09  clocKwize: I'd rather have code I can understand in a portable format, in a well known and supported language, with a large set of tools at my disposal
12:09  markasea: do you want to try out my Price Comparer?
12:09 +Branes: Nah. I never bother to compare prices on anything anyway.
12:09  markasea: www.freaky.staticusers.net used to be my favorite site
12:09  markasea: Freaks Macintosh Archive
12:11  markasea: looks like it shut down
12:11  clocKwize: you guys seen invisible hand? it's a plugin for all popular browsers that notices when you are looking at a product, then goes away and checks for it cheaper on other sites and pops up with the results in an unobtrusive way
12:11  clocKwize: http://www.getinvisiblehand.com
12:11  clocKwize: don't even know it's there until it finds something cheaper for you :p
12:12  markasea: :( 
12:13  markasea: Anyone know a good screen recorder for mac
12:13  markasea: that saves videos
12:13  markasea: not screenshots
12:13  markasea: freeware?
12:17  markasea: anyone?
12:19  Angostura: Quicktime Player markasea 
12:19  markasea: that does it?
12:19  markasea: how?
12:19  Angostura: Look under the File menu 
12:19  Angostura: (Snow Leopard only)
12:20  markasea: And can i ask one more question
12:20  markasea: can you help me with my applescript

12:22  Angostura: Don't ask to ask, ask :-)
12:22  markasea: ok
12:22  markasea: :)
12:23  markasea: in applescript i know how to make it keystroke what ever i enter into my dialog display 
12:24  markasea: keystroke _text
12:24  markasea: and returned text etc.
12:24  markasea: i have the code
12:24  markasea: but how do i do it with numbers
12:24  markasea: like another messaage dialog and it will keystroke however many nmber of times i put in the other dialog
12:24  Angostura: Nope, can't help
12:24  markasea: _number
12:24  markasea: get it?
12:24  markasea: why
12:25  Angostura: Why can't I help?
12:25  markasea: yeah
12:25  Angostura: Because I do not know the answer
12:33  iaj: are there some experts with port?
12:33  iaj: i installed texlive yesterday.. and now want to get rid of all of it + its dependencies.. how would I do that?
13:43  iaj: another thing.. sudo port install coreutils +with_default_names  should install GNU ls correct/

15:53  zer0her0: hm don't have any epubs on this machine, does iTunes 10.1 finally let you view epubs on your mac?
15:55 +Tomis: iTunes doesn't have an ereader, no
15:55 +Tomis: there are other apps for that
15:57  zer0her0: Tomis: yea but you'd think since it would let you store your epubs in iTunes it would let you view them
15:57 +Tomis: not really
15:57  torchie: can you read your ibooks on anything besides an iOS device?
15:57 +Tomis: iBooks can read ePub, PDF, what else?
15:57  torchie: oh
15:58  torchie: well I mean the ones you get from the store
15:58 +Tomis: really, Preview.app should be the one with ePub support
16:01  zer0her0: torchie: i buy all my books from the publisher in drm-free epub
16:02  torchie: I don't buy ebooks :d
16:02  torchie: I live 100 yards away from a library lol
16:02  zer0her0: torchie: i'm done carrying my books everywhere
16:02  zer0her0: i nearly throw my back out everytime i move
16:02  zer0her0: Tomis: eh preview and itunes should support epub if you ask me
16:03  torchie: I'm not sure if I can be guaranteed the same books I find in the library in digital format
16:03 +Tomis: iTunes is a bloated monstrosity
16:03 +Tomis: last thing it needs is a built-in ereader
16:03  zer0her0: Tomis: exactly one more feature won't matter
16:03 +Tomis: a button to open the files in an ereader would be more sensible
16:03  zer0her0: torchie: i work right under a library and archives ;)
16:04  zer0her0: Tomis: they did that w/ video files originally in both iPhoto and iTunes now it's just bundle in
16:04  zer0her0: actually the smart way to do it is just use the ereader engine and make function calls to display it in itunes
16:04 +Tomis: that makes no sense zer0her0 
16:04 +Tomis: mac os x has no "ereader engine"
16:05  zer0her0: not yet
16:05  zer0her0: ;)
16:05  zer0her0: also it sort of does, all UI is screen PDF
16:06  kamol: hi guys, I am trying move .htaccess rewrite rules to httpd.conf in mac os X server, however cannot figure out, can you give some tips?
16:06 +Tomis: ah huh
16:06 +Tomis: PDF, not ePud
16:06  torchie: ePud!
16:06  zer0her0: haha
16:06  torchie: sequel to the emac
16:06 +Tomis: copy and paste kamol ?
16:06  torchie: man when I saw an emac for the first time in someone's house I got my mind blown
16:06  torchie: like WHAT IS THAT THING
16:06 +Tomis: it's a monitor, now where is the computer torchie !!
16:07  zer0her0: Tomis: i know, epub is just bundled html/css basically it's really not that big a deal
16:07  torchie: omg wheres the start menu !!
16:07  torchie: nah but it was just
16:07 +Tomis: except they they've yet to add support for it to the OS
16:07  torchie: beforehand I saw imacs and I saw powermacs and ibooks but never an emac
16:07 +Tomis: should have included it in 10.6.5
16:07 +Tomis: hell, they added support for a whole new file system to the thing
16:07  torchie: you know what else should have been included in something somewhere
16:08  torchie: docx saving in iWork >:(
16:08  zer0her0: Tomis: are you talking to me?
16:08 +Tomis: it exports to .doc doesn't it
16:08  fujisan: zer0her0: 
16:08  fujisan: Tomis: 
16:08 +Tomis: that's close enough
16:08  zer0her0: fujisan: 
16:08  torchie: no
16:08  torchie: it's not
16:08  fujisan: it didnt work :( i am unable to install 10.4 :(
16:09 +Tomis: it exports to a format that word can import
16:09  torchie: instead of just apple-Sing it and calling it a day
16:09 +Tomis: that's all that matters
16:09  zer0her0: fujisan: what system?
16:09  torchie: I'm sitting here keeping track of two separate files
16:09 +Tomis: why?
16:09  torchie: because it just haaaaas to save in pages format
16:09  fujisan: i wanted to install 10.4 on my iMac i have SL installed on it
16:09 +Tomis: that's a very silly thing to do fujisan 
16:09 +Tomis: why do you want to downgrae?
16:09  zer0her0: torchie: yea pages is teh suck if you want to go back and forth to a pc
16:09  zer0her0: fujisan: wtf? why?!
16:10  torchie: and let's face it
16:10  fujisan: Tomis:  why is it silly ;d i wanted to run tiger next to SL
16:10  fujisan: not instead
16:10  torchie: if youre editing word docs
16:10  torchie: youre going back and forth with pcs
16:10  fujisan: 10.4 is snappier
16:10  fujisan: 10.4 runs the same apps faster
16:10 +Tomis: then you'd have bought office anyway torchie 
16:10 +Tomis: so big deal
16:10  torchie: I have that too but it's balls compared to iwork
16:10 +Tomis: be happy they gave you an import/export options
16:10  kamol: Tomis: if I am changing vi /etc/apache2/sites/0003_192.168.1.15_80_webehime.jp.conf file, it will be overwritten when I restart apache.
16:11 +Tomis: just do everything in OOo, heh
16:11  fujisan: i have 10.4 installed in  vmware now 
16:11  torchie: OOo, worse than the rest
16:11  fujisan: and it is faster than SL
16:11  zer0her0: google docs ftw
16:11 +Tomis: it's also doing way less fujisan 
16:11  torchie: google docs doesn't even have hanging indent support
16:11  fujisan: Tomis:  yeah sure
16:11  torchie: and if there's no internet
16:11  torchie: dead
16:12  zer0her0: torchie: lies there is never no internet
16:12  torchie: the internet is gonna die in 2012
16:12  zer0her0: also it should be noted i don't know how to read or write
16:12  torchie: THE WHOLE INTERNET IS GOING TO DIE
16:12  zer0her0: i just open it and press on the keyboard till it looks pretty
16:12  fujisan: you guys mind if i say something in dutch?
16:12  torchie: yes
16:12  torchie: we speak finnish here
16:13  fujisan: i chat in English 2/7 sometimes i need to reset my subvocalizedroutines 
16:13  zer0her0: fujisan: go for it
16:13  zer0her0: just don't expect us to respond w/ anything but a kick
16:13  zer0her0: ;) just kidding
16:14  fujisan: torchie de geëmancipeerde vogeltjes-dans is te ingewikkeld voor de trotse pauwen 
16:14  torchie: aww he said a thing about me
16:14  fujisan: :D
16:14  zer0her0: haha
16:14  fujisan: the emancipated bird dance is too complicated for the proud peacocks << thats all i said torchie 
16:15  torchie: oh is that like the dutch quick brown foxes?
16:15  fujisan: :D
16:15  fujisan: yeah something like that
16:17  zer0her0: fujisan: nice :)
16:18  fujisan: =]
16:19  fujisan: who owns this channel btw?
16:19  torchie: I do
16:19  fujisan: ORLLY :D
16:19  torchie: I am the channelmaster
16:19 +Branes: bashusr does
16:20  fujisan: oh ok
16:20  torchie: who is this bashusr
16:20  torchie: is he the alpha male
16:20  zer0her0: torchie: are you the keymaster?
16:20  torchie: i challenge him to unarmed combat
16:21  torchie: I don't own enough keys for that :(
16:21  zer0her0: hah
16:22  zer0her0: fujisan: why do you wanna know who owns the channel?
16:22  torchie: fujisan also wishes to challenge the alpha male to unarmed combat
16:22 +Tomis: no one owns this channel
16:22 +Tomis: this channel is un-ownable
16:23 +Tomis: just like macs
16:23  torchie: lol
16:24  torchie: speaking of that,  time to check on @ceostevejobs
16:24  fujisan: Tomis:  yeah some people are still idling in my swineflu channel i have no idea why though
16:24  daddysmurf: bad news: tried to order a replacement osx cd... $130
16:25  daddysmurf: I think I'm gonna cry...
16:25 +Tomis: 130 is the same as the cost of the box set
16:25  fujisan: couldnt get a cheaper one from ebay?
16:25 +Tomis: what machine is it for?
16:25  daddysmurf: Tomis: that's what the sales guy said
16:25  daddysmurf: fujisan: haven't checked yet
16:25  daddysmurf: Tomis: macbook
16:25  daddysmurf: a1811 I think
16:25 +Tomis: who did you try to order it from?
16:26  daddysmurf: Tomis: apple
16:26  daddysmurf: 1-800-MY-APPLE
16:26 +Tomis: damn
16:26 +Tomis: that doesn't sound correct
16:26  fujisan: arent you allowed to make a backup of your install dvds?
16:26 +Tomis: of curse fujisan 
16:26  daddysmurf: Tomis: I don't have the original
16:26  fujisan: oh ok
16:26  zer0her0: daddysmurf: how old is the macbook?
16:26  daddysmurf: I got the box second-hand
16:27  zer0her0: daddysmurf: oh you called the retail line
16:27  daddysmurf: zer0her0: I think early 2009, it's a core2duo, 2.0
16:27  zer0her0: they're just trying to sell you a copy
16:27  zer0her0: 1-800-apl-care is apple care
16:27  zer0her0: they'll tell you replacement media price
16:27  fujisan: can you call apple care via the facetime app?
16:27  daddysmurf: zer0her0: don't you have to have the original for that?
16:28  zer0her0: fujisan: haha no
16:28 +Tomis: the original what daddysmurf 
16:28  zer0her0: daddysmurf: yea what original
16:28  daddysmurf: Tomis: install disk
16:28 +Tomis: you realize how little sense that would make
16:28  daddysmurf: Tomis: it's apple... you know how little sense having 1 mouse button makes to me?
16:28 +Tomis: they haven't had one mouse button for years
16:29 +Tomis: just call the apple care number
16:29  daddysmurf: kinda threw out what "makes sense" when I got this thing, and tried to adopt the apple way
16:29 +Tomis: ask 'em how much for replacement system DVDs for your model macbook
16:29  daddysmurf: Tomis: yessir... will do on the next cig break
16:30  daddysmurf: and as far as one button, I'm pretty sure the touch pad on my macbook has a single button
16:30  daddysmurf: I'm hoping it understands 2 fingers
16:30 +Tomis: two finger tap for right click
16:30 +Tomis: or you can click in the corner for right click
16:31 +Tomis: system prefs>trackpad
16:31  daddysmurf: gotta get that far :/
16:31  zer0her0: Tomis: not the model he has
16:31 +Tomis: personally i prefer tap to click in general
16:31 +Tomis: well he could upgrade then zer0her0 
16:31  zer0her0: right corner click only showed up w/ no buttan trackpad
16:31  torchie: the macbook doesn't just have the best trackpad
16:31  torchie: it has the only good one.
16:31  zer0her0: Tomis: ah there's the mac way ;)
16:31  torchie: so yeah.
16:31 +Tomis: of course zer0her0 
16:32  zer0her0: torchie: yea apple trackpads == amazing
16:32  zer0her0: magic mouse gets no love now
16:32  daddysmurf: magic mouse looked pretty cool from what I saw
16:32 +Tomis: their mice have always been bad experiments
16:32  torchie: I kinda liked magic mouse
16:33  zer0her0: torchie: agreed
16:33 +Tomis: which is odd considering they've got the best trackpads out there
16:33  zer0her0: other then their first mouse ever
16:33  zer0her0: i love the design/look of all their mice, but hate to use them
16:33  torchie: only good trackpads*
16:54  webPragmatist: can you make colloquy use growl instead
16:56 +Tomis: yes, it uses the growl framework webPragmatist 
16:56  webPragmatist: oh i guess it just styles it different
16:57 +Tomis: you cna change that in the settings
16:57  zer0her0: haha
16:57 +Tomis: in growl's per-application settings
16:58  webPragmatist: hrm
16:59  webPragmatist: Tomis: you sure?
16:59  webPragmatist: it doesn't show up in Growl applications
16:59 +Tomis: it's in mine
16:59  webPragmatist: did you have to configure it otherwise?
16:59 +Tomis: configure what
17:00  webPragmatist: Do you mean the Growl notification for when someone PMs you? If you install Growl proper (instead of relying on the Growl that's built in to Colloquy) you can customize the appearance of your notifications... but PMs will display in a window in Colloquy's interface as well. I don't think links in Growl notifications can be clickable.
17:00  webPragmatist: a
17:00  webPragmatist: h
17:01  webPragmatist: meh i'll eff with this later
17:09  webPragmatist: Tomis: looks like you use the nightly for growl
17:10 +Tomis: Growl 1.2.1
17:10  webPragmatist: no i mean colloquy nightly
17:10 +Tomis: nope
17:10  webPragmatist: then it has something to do with detection of 64bit growl
17:10 +Tomis: i dunno what to tel lyou
17:10  webPragmatist: i dunno... i'm just saying i downloaded the nightly of colloquy and it worked 
17:11 +Tomis: it just works for me
17:11  webPragmatist: just relaying
17:11 +Tomis: colloquy Version 2.3 (4617)
17:12  webPragmatist: Tomis: hrmm... like i said maybe something to do with 64bit growl
17:13  webPragmatist: There's a ticket out there it seems it had problems with detecting growl so maybe yours was enabled already before the newer growl
17:15  webPragmatist: http://leenux.org.uk/2009/09/02/colloquy-on-snow-leopard-growl-issues/
17:40  demism: For a macbook air what would you guys recommend once done using it? leave it plugged and shutdown, unplug and sleep, etc...
17:46  MrUnagi: Nmsg
18:17  Quatroking: Hi
18:17  S_SubZero: howdy
18:17  Quatroking: I'm just about to open up my iMac G3 and expand the RAM, anything I should be prepared for?
18:17  claude2: dust
18:18  Quatroking: I'm asking this because the iMac G3 series have a CRT built-in, and if I remember right, these babies can hold quite the amount of kilovolts even when unplugged
18:18  S_SubZero: as long as you got the right RAM and the right tools you should be good to go.
18:19  Quatroking: Got me a few phillips screwdrivers and some PC100 which should fit in just fine according to Wikipedia
18:19  Quatroking: is the CRT really that much of a danger or not?
18:19  S_SubZero: Is the RAM not accessed through a panel?  I didnt think the iMac required opening up to replace RAM
18:19  Quatroking: not sure
18:20  S_SubZero: maybe you should make sure.  This falls under the "right tools" (documentation) category.
18:20  jeremyw: Quatroking: You can release the stored power by just turning it on while unplugged.  Do it a few times and you shouldn't brush up against anything htat might give you a jolt.
18:20  Quatroking: do note this is a G3, not a simple tiny new-age mac
18:20  claude2: the ram slot should be protected from the back of the crt i think
18:21  S_SubZero: Quatroking: you sound like you're doubting me.
18:21  claude2: i upgraded the ram in one years ago
18:22  Quatroking: S_SubZero, I have yet to find any panel on my G3 :/
18:22  S_SubZero: it may not be a "new-age mac" but it's still a mac. http://www.faqintosh.com/risorse/en/guides/hw/imac/imacg3dvram/
18:22  Quatroking: unless its really camoufalged well
18:22  Quatroking: camouflaged*
18:22  Quatroking: oh, wow, derp
18:22  Quatroking: sorry for doubting you :P
18:25  Quatroking: ow wow, this thing even has an external VGA port
18:25  Quatroking: I didn't know that!
18:25  zer0her0: Quatroking: look up degaussing
18:25  zer0her0: if you want to be really super careful
18:26  zer0her0: but yes in theory a CRT can carry alot of juice, i've worked on many and never had a problem
18:27 --- PeaMan is now known as PeaMan_
18:27  Quatroking: Now, wikipedia says that it should support up to 384MB RAM
18:28  Quatroking: even though Apple says 128MB
18:28  Quatroking: will 192MB work fine?
18:29  zer0her0: wait what are you working on? sorry just read what's on screen havne't scrolled back
18:30  Quatroking: upgrading the RAM
18:30  zer0her0: oh you shouldn't come anywhere near the guass coil
18:30  zer0her0: you'll be fine
18:30  Quatroking: I managed to buy myself a iMac G3 a few weeks ago for 40 bucks (ebay wahay) and the 64MB thats installed right now is just, meh
18:30  Quatroking: ah, okay
18:32  Quatroking: off we go then!
18:33  zer0her0: Quatroking: best of luck
18:37  S_SubZero: My friend came across one of those not long ago.  Being computer illiterate she's like "MAKE THIS DO NORMAL (ie. modern) STUFF!"  .... yeah, about that
18:38  S_SubZero: it ain't gonna do youtube.
18:38  Quatroking: okay, this probably sounds silly, but I can't find the RAM bay at all
18:39  Quatroking: the pics over at faqintosh seem to use a different version of the G3 than I own
18:39  Quatroking: which seems likely considering mine is an original Bondi Blue
18:39  Quatroking: you know, the release model
18:39  Quatroking: Revision A
18:40  S_SubZero: maybe try googling for it.
18:44  Quatroking: yeah, looks like I'll have to dissasemble it
18:44  Quatroking: ugh
18:44  ImQ009: hello
18:45  ImQ009: My iMac (Early 2006, 17") Doesn't read some DVD's

18:45  ImQ009: it just spins for about minute then ejects
18:46  ImQ009: Could somone help me please?

20:39  zer0her0: 60 to 150 USD
20:40  rubydiamond: so it's like $180 in India
20:40  rubydiamond: :(
20:41  zer0her0: yea
20:41  zer0her0: sure why not
20:43  rubydiamond: zer0her0: you mean $180 is fine
20:45  zer0her0: rubydiamond: i mean translating currency is very different from translating price of an item in a country
20:46  S_SubZero: is buying things really so complicated?
20:46  rubydiamond: zer0her0: it's like $360 for 4GB ram
20:46  rubydiamond: it's more
20:46  rubydiamond: it's way more than US
20:46  rubydiamond: 4GB Ram (2GB + 2GB )
20:46  rubydiamond: I mean
20:47  zer0her0: S_SubZero: of course it is

20:56  S_SubZero: I assume it has some bridged capability.
21:01  vxla: zer0her0: i wonder if that memory works in a MBP
21:01  zer0her0: haha
21:02  daemoen: hey guys
21:02  vxla: looks like an 8GB upgrade would be around $140
21:03  zer0her0: sup
21:03  daemoen: so, ive done some googling, and found out about onyx,  is there any other set of tools people commonly recommend to keep their macs running pristine ?
21:03  zer0her0: vxla: the guy was asking about india's pricing
21:03  daemoen: im used to using things like ccleaner, defraggler, etc on windows
21:03  daemoen: what are the equivs for mac =D
21:03  zer0her0: daemoen: yea i just use mine, no tools needed
21:03  vxla: zer0her0: yea i was looking on amazon just now.
21:04  vxla: i really need to upgrade to 8GB
21:05  zer0her0: yea my macbook pro could use an upgrade, sadly i doubt my mac pro will get pushed to  16GB anytime soon.
21:07  vxla: are 8GB modules avialable for MBPs? I didn't think they were yet.

22:43  solar_sea: Hi. I'm forced into using a mac at my work place. For god's sake, is there a way to get home and & keys working like all other platforms in the last 20 years ? Anything, hint, payed application, external hardware, etc ?
22:51  acer_: I started using Onix application and my Mac frozed, now I booted from my OS DVD and it doesn't recognize my main HDD.
22:51  Amaterasu-chan: solar_sea: get a logitec keyboard maybe
22:52  Amaterasu-chan: acer_: maybe hardware failure?
22:52  acer_: What can I do? Did I loose everything on it?
22:52  Amaterasu-chan: im not sure really, im not that good at that stuff =/
22:52  acer_: ok, maybe someone could help me on that please?
22:53  solar_sea: Amaterasu-chan, I'm using an external, usb, pc one, since the build in one in the macbook I have to use does not even have those keys
22:54  Amaterasu-chan: why do you need those keys anyways?
22:54  solar_sea: Good question. I'm a programmer, I mainly edit text files and I'm used with those for years, it's a habbit
22:55  Amaterasu-chan: you can use like shift+cmd+h or something for home key
22:55  Amaterasu-chan: or maybe it was fn+left arrow?
22:55  solar_sea: ctrl+arrows works in SOME apps, but sadly not all
22:55  solar_sea: and I'm unable to find a global settings option about those
22:56  solar_sea: I manager to get it *fixed* in the Terminal application but I'm struggling with all others
22:57  Amaterasu-chan: cant you maybe just add it as a application shortcut under keyboard in system prefs..
22:57  solar_sea: But even not working is better than the default behavior which is ofter a case of heavy frustration, i'm in the middle of a several thousand lines of code and I need to get the start of the row, I press "Home" and I get at the top of the document, having lost my previous position.
22:58  Amaterasu-chan: maybe you can write some code to fix it =P hehe 
22:58  Amaterasu-chan: or try fn+arrow keys
22:58  solar_sea: In the end I might just do that :D
22:58  solar_sea: fn = cmd ?
22:58  Amaterasu-chan: no
22:58  solar_sea: ops, there was a dedicated fn button on the mac itself, I see
22:58  Amaterasu-chan: you had a macbook right? should be a fn key on the keyboard
22:59  Amaterasu-chan: =)
22:59  Amaterasu-chan: or look under keyboard in system prefs, you can add shortcuts there
22:59  Amaterasu-chan: and just invent one for it yourself
22:59  solar_sea: thanks, I'll try it tomorrow in the office
22:59  Amaterasu-chan: you can pic the apps etc you want the shortcut to be for there I think
23:00  Amaterasu-chan: pick
23:00  Amaterasu-chan: cmd+up might also work
23:00  Amaterasu-chan: try some combination...

23:25  downhill_: hi there, I have a simple question on behalf of a less-tech-savy friend. What's the easiet way to control an OS X machine over the Internet from a Windows client? Anything that can handle Nat (no port forwarding)?
23:25  atmosx: it seems that I have a problem ... 
23:25  atmosx: a hard one
23:25  atmosx: with Time machine
23:25  atmosx: "The operation couldn’t be completed. (OSStatus error 2.)"
23:25  atmosx: downhill_: logmein and teamviewer
23:26  diffract|: what kind of control?
23:26  atmosx: remote
23:26  downhill_: mouse and kb, so not SSH. I should have mentioned that.
23:26  downhill_: I was thinking of VNC, but that means forwarding ports.
23:26  diffract|: i ain't have experience with that
23:27  atmosx: ...
23:27  atmosx: logmein takes 5 minutes to setup
23:27  downhill_: huh teamview looks cool
23:27  downhill_: hmmm works through NAT? :P

23:28  downhill_: nah, does logmein work through NAT.
23:28  downhill_: already read the teamview stuff. I'm sorry this is so dysfunctional :P
23:29  Pawnee: As he recommended it ... I guess so.
23:29  downhill_: i was hoping it was just gonna be a "go click this box" sort of deal.
23:29  luy: does anybody knows about powerbook g4 keyboards? I have to replace mine, and I have some doubts...
23:32  atmosx: downhill_: yeah logmein works through nat

23:32  downhill_: thanks atmosx :)
23:32  atmosx: Lusule: yes, search for an rtf2txt script
23:33  Lusule: anyone?  is there one in particular that's known to be reliable?
23:33  Lusule: *any one
23:34  atmosx: Lusule: no idea
23:34  Lusule: i tend to be immediately suspicious of any website with 'wares' in the URL :D  guilty until proven innocent....
23:37  S_SubZero: I'm not big on housewares either
23:38  S_SubZero: (wares=ok, ware<z>=bad)

23:40  atmosx: ichat has screen sharing
23:41  atmosx: and it's quite decent actually
