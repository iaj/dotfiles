00:01  ZGirl: Hello - does anyone know if it's possible to add another .local address that routes to my computer? I'm currently using one that i can set in system preferences, but would like to add another (and more if possible) to support multiple local websites. Thanks!

01:01  sig: hey guys, I installed this productivity tool bar in safari and I don't konw where to get rid of it from. I don't see it in applications.
01:01  sig: anyone know where to look?
01:02  sig: found it
01:02  sig: hah
01:14  augur: anyone know of any good apps for file/website tagging?
01:17  cryptics_: tagging?
01:19  augur: like, adding tags to a file
01:19  augur: not ID3
01:21  cryptics_: not that i know. don't really see the point seeing that spotlight can do content search and a good naming convention often doesn't require tags
01:21  koro: augur: finder can tag files, can't it?
01:22  augur: koro: not in a way that's sensible.
01:24  koro: oh it has a max of 7 labels possible
01:24  koro: lol
01:25  augur: it also doesnt have a convenient way to browse tags
01:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
01:27  koro: what do you mean?
01:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
01:27  koro: it's pretty easy to browse tags if they're only 7
01:27  augur: well, yes, but not if there's a thousand :p
01:28  augur: i mean, cryptics suggests using file naming conventions
01:28  cryptics_: he doesn't mean labels
01:28  augur: but that doesnt let me look at the list of tags in use
01:28  koro: yeah, he didn't offer a solution to your problem
01:28  augur: i have to know what the tags are in order to search for them
01:28  koro: that's common practice in irc
01:28  koro: or anywhere for the matter
01:28  augur: :P
01:28  cryptics_: i said i don't know to start off
01:28  cryptics_: what else do you want me to say?
01:28  augur: nothing!
01:28  augur: im just sayin.
01:28  cryptics_: :)
01:29  augur: i suppose i could just build the damn thing
01:29  augur: meh
01:29  augur: fine
01:29  koro: augur: i've always wanted to have a good file tagging system in place
01:29  koro: but beware, such things are dangerous
01:29  augur: why so
01:29  koro: i mean, if you really rely on the tags, you can create a mess
01:29  augur: what do you mean
01:29  koro: you can have two things; an app can store the tags in some kind of separate database
01:30  augur: well thats my intention
01:30  koro: or it can store the tags in a per-file basis like mac os does with labels and icons and other data
01:30  augur: no, im going to store a database. thatll allow you to tag non-files too
01:30  cryptics_: my impression is a tagging system like you use in iphoto
01:31  koro: the later is dangerous because it's too easy to lose that kind of data (it depends on the mac os filesystem, and even without going to other filesystems it's easy to create trouble)
01:32  koro: so, the other option, the tags of the files being stored in some kind of separate database, is the only decent one; but in that case you would have to have the app running and monitoring file modifications all the time to update the database (like spotlight, or something)
01:32  temhawk: even OS X's native tag-like system, Spotlight comments, can easily vanish, for example when you compress a file..
01:32  koro: i mean, the problem is that this solution would depend on the _location_ of the files, it wouldn't be actually tied to the files themselves
01:33  koro: yeah, or if you use command line tools
01:33  cryptics_: yeah you could just have a db with the name of file minus the path and tag that
01:33  cryptics_: it wouldn't rely on path
01:33  koro: i think if you move or copy a file with cp or mv, you screw everything
01:33  koro: all the resource fork stuff
01:33  koro: cryptics_: typically there are plenty of files with the same name in a computer...
01:34  cryptics_: koro: but if you follow mac logic and i am assuming it's just files he created which should be in home, i don't really see what the problem is
01:34  cryptics_: is he going to tag everying in core services?
01:35  temhawk: the database could also mark specific blocks of data on the disk with tags in a database
01:35  koro: well i have in my home dir plenty of files with the same names (in different folders)
01:35  cryptics_: hrm
01:35 * cryptics_ mutters something about naming convention
01:35  JeffJassky_: Hey, guys. Having an issue with my macbook pro display - http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffjassky my screen is "washed out" seeming and my gradients are all messed up.
01:36  koro: dude, sometimes you have a folder with, say, a project of something, and you create a copy of it, and then change the key files, but some other files remain the same
01:36  koro: that's just an example
01:36  JeffJassky_: I've confirmed my contrast is disabled in universal access.
01:36  koro: code is another
01:37  koro: in any case, i don't think there's any reasonable solution that doesn't involve a database that's regularly updated
01:39  S_SubZero: JeffJassky_: There's no real "push the fix contrast button" option obviously. Screen issues are "take it to the shop" issues.
01:39  temhawk: koro: if the database kept track of files directly by their location on the disk instead of in the filesystem, it wouldn't have to track changes to their filesystem location.
01:39  koro: no i never suggested keeping track of the filesystem, that would be insane
01:40  JeffJassky_: S_SubZero: Right. I'm wondering if anyone's seen this issue and might know what point of failure I may have. I've replaced the main video cable with no avail. The top case is removed right now and I'm trying to locate the issue. Just hoping someone could maybe shed some light.
01:40  koro: i mean a database keeping track of the file location (path(
01:40  temhawk: that's what i meant by filesystem location -> the path
01:41  koro: uh
01:41  koro: then what do you mean by location "on the disk"?
01:42  koro: oh. I get it.
01:42  temhawk: because the data doesn't move on the disk if you put it in another folder, the database can be offline, and if you move a tagged file to a different folder and then start the database system again, it would still know that file exists and have its tags
01:42  koro: Something that wouldn't change when i just move the file, yeah.
01:43  koro: yes but then if the database is offline and you delete the file (or copy/delete instead of moving) or replace it by something else...
01:43  temhawk: i don't know if that's actually possible though, there may be some technical barrier to doing that
01:44  koro: the question is, what do you want to tag, a file or a space in the disk. I think you want to tag the file. And what is the file, and when does it stop being that file and becomes a different file. Philosophical questions that are confusing at times :P
01:44  temhawk: yeah, deletion of the file, even editing probably, would be a problem
01:44  temhawk: heh yeah
01:44  koro: Does a file stop being that file if i move it? What if i copy it and then delete the original? What if i edit it? And if i edit it and then move it? whut.
01:45  temhawk: let's take this to #philosophy xD
01:45  koro: i'm done ;)
01:45  augur: the file of theseus
01:47  koro: hehe
01:48  temhawk: tagging should be a feature of the OS :/
01:48  koro: augur: anyway, did you try nifty box and tagit?
01:48  augur: no
01:48  koro: those are free so maybe you can try 
01:49  koro: first hit in google...
01:49  koro: temhawk: agreed.
01:49  augur: ill look at them
01:50  koro: actually, this sounds pretty interesting https://code.google.com/p/openmeta/wiki/OpenMetaApplications
01:51  koro: there's a list of apps that use the openmeta tagging standard
01:51  temhawk: sadly OpenMeta isn't cross-platform
01:52  Branes:  /clear
01:52  augur: niftybox might do what i want :o
01:52  cryptics_: heh
01:52  koro: temhawk: yeah, that's gonna be a problem with tagging...
01:53  koro: again, if the file tags are not stored on a per-file basis, it's hard to make this independent of the OS
01:53  koro: meh, even if they are...
01:53  temhawk: yup
01:54  augur: its a same that this app doesnt import delicious exports
01:54  temhawk: http://gal.patheticcockroach.com/wallpapers/choose_your_poison
01:55  augur: also why the hell arent there key bindings :|
01:56  koro: implying that linux is not poison?
01:56  augur: OS/2 kthxbai
01:57  temhawk: koro: heh
01:58  temhawk: Linux feels less poisonous to me than Mac and Windows... but I guess it depends on the biochemical response..
02:05  augur: good thing you're in ##mac and not ##linux, ey?
02:07  temhawk: augur: why? :)

02:46  temhawk: if you want to be technical, yes. but you could make money in the time you spend writing an app that has been done before, so indirectly time is money
02:47  augur: that assumes i need terribly much money
02:47  augur: and that the value of the money is greater than the value of having a tag app that does what i want
02:47  augur: and that i can modify
02:47  augur: etc
02:47  augur: its not.
02:47  sig: lol
02:48  sig: anyone?
02:48  temhawk: augur: no it doesn't assume that you need terribly much money. Punakea costs $25. if you don't have that kind of money on you, it means you're actually rather poor or are afraid to spend
02:48  augur: well i do, but i mean, you're assuming that i need the however much money i wouldnt be making by writing the software
02:49  augur: or rather, that i need the n - 25 dollars that i would be loosing by not buying punake
02:49  augur: a
02:49  temhawk: augur: but if you would enjoy making this app, and feel like you could acquire useful knowledge, it's a different story of course :)
02:49  augur: not only that, but having an app that does what i want is.
02:49  augur: and that i can modify.

02:50  augur: (i wouldnt)
02:50  temhawk: true dat, but I think an app that has been developed on for years is going to be more mature than anything you can come up with quickly
02:50  augur: thats fine
02:50  augur: im not looking for more mature

09:29  temhawk: hey, does anyone have clue why my iMac would just turn black (the screen, not the case, lol) for absolutely no apparent reason? (I was simply staring at a webpage when it happened.)
09:35  ayaz: temhawk: So, I am guessing, if you move your mouse or press any keys, the display comes back up.
09:36  temhawk: ayaz: no, that would be sleep :p
09:36  temhawk: ayaz: i can't do anything. no keyboard button/shortcut or mouse movement/click has any effect. the computer just silently continues to be blank..
09:37  ayaz: temhawk: Is it still on? Does the computer turn itself off as well?
09:41  temhawk: ayaz: it made absolutely no noise when it happened. just went blank (but still light being emitted), I wasn't even doing anything, just lookin at a web page, like i said. in the Console there seems to be nothing, just a 	"kernel	 npvhash=4095" line followed by a "	Firewall [62] 	krb5kdc is listening from 0.0.0.0:88 proto=6", even though the time stamp on the former is later than than the time stamp of the latter, which looks like was the last log messa
09:41  temhawk: me-wise) before i hard-resetted my Mac
09:43  ayaz: temhawk: Does that happen often?
09:45  temhawk: ayaz: i think this is the first time this has happened to me. however, a week ago, I had a similar experience in which I just got a bunch of vertical lines on the screen, it was also quite random. this was on ANOTHER Mac, though.
09:47  ayaz: temhawk: That could hint at bad memory or any other piece of hardware going bad. 
09:47  ayaz: temhawk: For example, I've a 2-year old MacBook whose battery seems to be going down. Around 30% drainage, the laptop would make a click sound and shut off in a split second. 
09:48  temhawk: o.O
09:49  temhawk: this iMac has not been used much at all
09:50  Branes: What GPU is in the iMac that went black on you?
09:51  Branes: It could be just the video-drivers that have crashed, but just as likely it could be a thermal fault with the GPU itself.
09:53  temhawk: Branes: it's an ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro, in both iMacs, so that would be an argument in favor of your theory
09:53  Branes: Download and apply the latest Mac OS X Update Combo, and also the Snow Leopard Graphics Update installer and apply that as well. Once done, use Disk Utility to repair permissions.
09:53  temhawk: they're both iMac8,1's
09:54  Branes: mm, like I said, could be either a soft or hard fault. The current drivers are less than stellar.
09:54  Branes: If you're paranoid, dig out your original DVDs and run an overnight hardware test.
09:54  temhawk: i will do that
09:55  Branes: Might also be worth putting something like iStat in to check your GPU temps.

10:09  Branes: OSX Finder loses the plot like that quite often, a quirk its exhibited since I started using OSX back with 10.3.9
10:10  Branes: Finder is quite brain-dead in several areas.
10:12  cryptics_: Branes: how do i reset the keychain password of another administrator without the OS dvd?
10:17  temhawk: Branes: a software like TotalFinder doesn't actually replace the Finder, right?
10:20  temhawk: (forgive me for just blatantly assuming that you know about such software)
10:46  Branes: temhawk: no, it doesn't
10:46  temhawk: ok, thanks
10:46  Branes: cryptics_: I don't believe you can.
10:47  Branes: Unless you have the tool saved from the DVD separately, I think you're out of luck
10:47  cryptics_: Branes: it's mothers account and i set up all the passwords for her so no biggie was trying to avoid resetting the modem that's all

12:01  mylisto: Anyone good with diagnosing ipods?
12:03  zubin71: hi everyone, im a new mac user. i was just watching a video online and its completely buffered. In ubuntu i would expect the video to be present in /tmp; where do I look for buffered videos in a mac?
12:04  zubin71: thanks in advance!
12:04  LSD`: Why would it be in /tmp on Ubuntu?
12:05  zubin71: buffered files go there
12:05  zubin71: LSD`: any idea where temporary files reside in a mac? i cant find the video in /tmp
12:07  LSD`: web browsers don't download cached files to /tmp on Linux either... In any case, if you're running safari you can bring up the Activity window (Window -> Activity or Option+Command+A) and, while the video is buffering, scroll through the Activity window and when you find the flv or whatever, double click it and saf will prompt you to download it
12:12  zubin71: LSD`: i see
12:12  zubin71: thanks
12:45  w00: hey guys, does anyone know how to cancel the white bit quicktime adds at the bottom of a video when it is played with an .idx file?

13:07  Ivis: LSD` dunno
13:07  LSD`: The original was a Classic app, meaning it doesn't run on Intel. I'm just wondering if they ported the version on Stem
13:08  Ivis: I don't know this game :D
13:09  LSD`: It was directed more at Angostura who presumably has Steam for OS X handy :P

14:24  g4bittin: Hi, somone know if there is exists Mac Usergroups in Sweden?
14:25  xelister: what is a jabber client, supporting off-the-record encryption (like pidgin does) readily available on mac?
14:25  g4bittin: Adium ?
14:25  xelister: its free ? open source?
14:26  g4bittin: yes
14:26  g4bittin: http://adium.im/
14:26  g4bittin: builds on libpurple as Pidgin does also
14:26  xelister: cool
14:26  xelister: what about sound support? and video
14:27  g4bittin: iam not sure
15:43  necktie: hi. can anyone help me with installing kmenc15 on a mac? http://kmenc15.sourceforge.net/
15:47  TheNavyBear: It requires at least 1.0pre7 MEncoder to work. It obviously needs KDE and Qt libs.
15:49  necktie: TheNavyBear: can i get those on a mac? if so, how?
15:49  necktie: well i already have mencoder
15:49  necktie: just need the others
15:58  shuaib: Has anyone tried compiling their own custom xnu kernel on snow leopard? This guide seems dated to me: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/build/build.html
15:59  shuaib: Or may be some of the initial required packages are failing to compile for me becase I am not using gcc3.3 as suggested? But the guide is meant to be for os x 10.4, and I am on 10.6.6, so thought may be latest gcc would work
16:03  TheNavyBear: necktie: the best route would be to find a package service (Fink/MacPorts/Homebrew) that has the app in there repository and use it, the app needs over 200 libs
16:12  necktie: TheNavyBear: i have macports. but it's not there. how can i check with fink and homebrew?
16:13  TheNavyBear: not sure, I do not use those
16:16  necktie: TheNavyBear: if i install the 200 libs, it will work?
16:16  incluye: Time Machine has been indexing my backup for eight and a half hours.
16:16  incluye: Is that normal?
16:16  TheNavyBear: if you go find each and every one, and the libs that those libs require
16:18  necktie: TheNavyBear: so basically, it's hopeless? i just searched fink and they don't have it either :'(
16:20  TheNavyBear: install Linux and then install it
16:20  necktie: alright
