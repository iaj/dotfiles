01:27  jeremyw: Not sure if it's DRM free or not, but I expect themt o be.
01:27  zer0rez: jeremyw: where?
01:27  jeremyw: zer0rez: Depends on the book I think.
01:27  zer0rez: LordDragon: that's why apple sells drm free aac, and amazon drm free mp3

01:35  locojay: hi i just installed an ssd on a mac pro / copied drive with carbon copy cloner. the strange thing is that boot time is still 40seconds but apps do start allot faster. no really improvement on hdd boot. any idea
01:36  locojay: after login screen all is super fast just the boot time. my mac book air is @ 8s !!
01:36  zer0rez: locojay: i'd reinstall personally
01:38  yazdmich: boot time varies
01:39  locojay: reinstall would take me 3 days :)
01:39  yazdmich: why?
01:40  locojay: allot of python , c++ libs ....
01:40  yazdmich: oh
01:40  yazdmich: well is a super quick boot needed?
01:41  yazdmich: i mean like, 40 seconds is pretty quick
01:41  locojay: not a must 
01:41  locojay: is there a tool to test drive speeds

So I'm gonna replace that, but I can't reformat it without the internal dvd drive, and I can't get a homebre netboot server working as an alternative.  But since I've already got the dvd drive out, I feel like tinkering with it, but have no idea where to start.

19:47  EdLin: LaraX: the EPIC 4g has nice hardware specs and a keyboard, but Samsung kind of makes it underperform by using the wrong filesystem in NAND.
19:48  EdLin: LaraX: the HTC EVO is a very nice phone. Only thing is you'd no longer have superamoled and a keyboard, but otherwise the stock is better and HTC supports their devices better.

20:01 +LaraX: I'm only familiar woth getting ops from bots other than chanserv but I'm assuming it's similar
20:01 +Berzerker: LaraX: /cs op ##mac
20:01 +LaraX: I thought so, thanks
20:02 +LaraX: [23] 02:01:41 PM -ChanServ- You are not authorized to perform this operation.
20:02 +Berzerker: you don't have ops
20:02 +Berzerker: you only have +V
20:02 +LaraX: yeah
20:02  EdLin: I have ops on ##mac-social, the dead mac channel. ;-)
20:04  EdLin: I'm IRCOp on glitch.fm, though people behave there so I don't have a chance to exercise my godlike powers there.
20:04  ErrantEgo: heh
20:04  ErrantEgo: im pretty much the same way on WorldIRC
20:04  EdLin: what's worldirc?
20:04  ErrantEgo: its so damn small, i only get to /kill a couple people in a channel they are on from time to time
20:05  ErrantEgo: at one time, it was a decent network
20:05  EdLin: yeah, there's one guy me and the other IRCOp have to kill from time to time. ;-)
20:05  ErrantEgo: its lost most of its users though for some reason
20:05  EdLin: too bad...
20:05  ErrantEgo: right now theres a total of 190 users on the entire network
20:06  EdLin: wow, that's smaller than glitch.fm
20:06  ErrantEgo: 2:05 PM: *** There are 3 users and 187 invisible on 4 servers
20:06  ErrantEgo: 2:05 PM: *** There are 6 operator(s) online
20:06  ErrantEgo: 2:05 PM: *** There are 1 unknown connection(s)
20:06  ErrantEgo: 2:05 PM: *** 31 channels have been formed.
20:06  ErrantEgo: 2:05 PM: *** I have 73 clients and 3 servers
20:07  ErrantEgo: :(
20:07  EdLin: hmm, we have actually a smaller number, but few of them are lurkers.
20:07  EdLin: it's fairly active when there's an internet radio show going on.
20:07  ErrantEgo: the network has about 97-98% ham radio operators
20:08  EdLin: ErrantEgo: ham isn't kosher.
20:08  ErrantEgo: but there are a few others from new zeland that have a couple channels there
20:08  EdLin: ErrantEgo: and kosher isn't kosher in New Zealand. ;-)
20:08  ErrantEgo: EdLin: meh
20:08  dimm: what file manager is more powerful for work with web hosting via ftp ?
20:09  EdLin: ErrantEgo: why did New Zealand make kosher meat illegal? I didn't know they had a lot of antisemitism there.
20:09  EdLin: !g ftp os x

20:13 * EdLin is listening to John Lee Hooker - I'm Bad Like Jesse James, from the album Live at Cafe Au-Go-Go [5:31 mins] [256 kbps AAC] [10.87 MB] [played 1 times]
20:20 +LaraX: EdLin: I go to that channel sometimes, including the other day. don't know if you ever see that scrollback from when you're gone
20:21  EdLin: LaraX: I usually do, but you're gone when I'm really there. :-(
20:21 +LaraX: I mostly just go to say hi to you and stuff but you're never there
20:21  vxla: what's the "+" in front of LaraX's name mean again?
20:21 +LaraX: and to see if anything has changed
20:21  EdLin: when I'm here, I'm there too.
20:21  EdLin: vxla: voice
20:21 +LaraX: what he said^
20:21  vxla: yea I can't remember what half this crap is sorry
20:22 +LaraX: it's ok
20:22 * LaraX sings since she has a voice now
20:22  vxla: still never really understood the voice thing
20:23  EdLin: LaraX: http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/22/nexaria-bc2-router-supports-iphone-tethering-for-some-reason-vi/
20:23  EdLin: LaraX: it's ugly, but it's perfect for you. ;-)
20:23  zer0rez: you can set a channel to moderated and it'll keep people from posting unless they have voice or higher
20:24  vxla: zer0rez: how did lara get voiced? did she piss someone off?
20:24 +LaraX: vxla: it can mean different things. often times on freenode (including this channel) it means the person is an op, but is only voiced atm, in a moderated channel (+m) only voiced (+v) people can type
20:24  zer0rez: i'm not sure, it would be the opposite
20:24  vxla: and LaraX, did you ever get your laptop?
20:24  zer0rez: i.d. voice is sometimes used to show regular users in case a channel is moderated suddenly
20:25 +LaraX: piss who off? no... I got voice because I was one of the people crilly trusted, if he gave it to me. that's what he said anyway
20:25  zer0rez: we used to use it on other networks to keep out spam bots, it would autovoice everyong but only after x amount of seconds or minutes
20:25  vxla: ah, gotcha
20:25 +LaraX: zer0rez: are you zer0her0?
20:25  vxla: I've only ever been in moderated channels that were invite-only
20:25  vxla: guess that's how we kept out bots
20:25 * zer0rez looks around
20:26  zer0rez: possssibblyyyy
20:26  zer0rez: bots aren't bad on here
20:26  vxla: not like efnet ;)
20:26 * LaraX thinks it is
20:27  zer0rez: or any irc network that doesn't have services
20:27 +LaraX: vxla: sometimes people just voice someone if they like them or whatever. people do it for all kinds of reasons
20:27 +LaraX: I used to manually voice and op people a lot
20:27 +LaraX: or add them to bots
20:27 +LaraX: on efnet though, no chanserv
20:28  EdLin: LaraX: what's a nice kid like you doing in a nasty place like EFNet? ;-)
20:28  LordDragon: yeah +v is not really used as its designed for. its mostly just a sign that the ops favor you, which is easy for most girls to get if they flirt with the right op ;)
20:28 +LaraX: EdLin: only because I didn't know any better at the time
20:28  vxla: LordDragon: exactly.
20:29  EdLin: on glitch.fm all of the girls have voice. ;-)
20:29  LordDragon: some ppl have nothing better to do than suck up to ops :P
20:29 +LaraX: LordDragon: um... I don't even talk to him
20:30  LordDragon: hey aL3x :)
20:30 +LaraX: I suppose the giys who got it flirted with him too
20:30  aL3x: hey LordDragon
20:30 +LaraX: guys*
20:30  EdLin: LaraX: who knows, this is a Mac channel, after all. ;->
20:30  LordDragon: aL3x, where in the world are you today?
20:30 * EdLin runs for cover
20:30 * vxla is hungry
20:30  diamonds: LordDragon: 1. flirt with op 2. get voiced 3. ??? 4. profit (?)
20:31  aL3x: LordDragon: phoenix, looking up recipes for thanksgiving
20:31  LordDragon: aL3x, oh cool. you gonna cook?
20:31  aL3x: LordDragon: this will be my first thanksgiving with family in over 10 years, and the absolute first i have cooked
20:31  vxla: good luck Altercation 
20:31  vxla: whoops
20:31  vxla: good luck aL3x 
20:31 * diamonds doesn't understand how/why voice is used in non moderated channels
20:31  aL3x: thanks vxla :)
20:31  LordDragon: aL3x, wow nice. with your little bro?
20:32  vxla: i cooked 3 years ago. 27 pound turkey. that took a while.
20:32  vxla: last year I spent thanksgiving in Leipzig. this year I'm jealous of last year.
20:32  aL3x: yeah, my little brother...i dunno if i mentioned it but he looks dead up like our mom...so it's like she lives thrugh him or somehting, i dunno
20:32  aL3x: vxla: lol@ jealous of last year
20:32  vxla: alas, puerto rico for xmas this year.
20:33  LordDragon: aL3x, what do you mean "looks dead up" ? ive never heard of that expression
20:33  aL3x: LordDragon: "dead up" is slang for "identical"
20:33  aL3x: LordDragon: might be a southernism...sometimesi use them and dont realise
20:33  LordDragon: aL3x, ohhh i see
20:34  aL3x: LordDragon: you got plans for thanksgiving
20:35  LordDragon: aL3x, yeah. most of my family is coming here to my house. should be interesting
20:35  LordDragon: hey Velociraptors :)
20:35 * EdLin is listening to John Lee Hooker - One Bourbon, One Scotch One Beer (1966 New York), from the album Live at Cafe Au-Go-Go [4:26 mins] [256 kbps AAC] [8.8 MB] [played 0 times]
20:35  aL3x: LordDragon: cool. i think its gonna be 4of us, me and my bf and my little bro and his gf
20:36  LordDragon: aL3x, thats cool. i think here there will be like 10-15 ppl
20:36  Velociraptors: g'morning :)
20:36  aL3x: i would like that many...i like people alot...
20:37  aL3x: or i like alot pf people rather
20:38  aL3x: LordDragon: i'm gonna make the google turkey...lol http://www.google.com/landing/thanksgiving/#turkey
20:40  LordDragon: aL3x, LOL. you mean a turkey that spys on your personal info and sells it to other companies? :P
20:40  aL3x: i dont live in the real world; my personal info is worthless
20:41  LordDragon: aL3x, i was just joking :P
20:41  aL3x: i know
20:41  aL3x: so was i
20:42  aL3x: LordDragon: i was actually beginning to think i was losing my comedic touch...cause i spend so much time in text only...but the other night, there was a huge party, and apparently i am still funny :)
20:42  LordDragon: aL3x, my drivers license is expiring soon. and they are demanding i go in to the DMV to get a new photo and eye exam. grrrr. i hate the DMV
20:43  aL3x: LordDragon: yeah, dmv...bleh
20:43  LordDragon: aL3x, wow your super social lately. glad to hear it
20:43  aL3x: LordDragon: i have always been social...i'm just mentally ill
20:43  LordDragon: aL3x, well you often tell me you dont like to be around ppl
20:44 * yazdmich np:  I'm on a Mac ft. Pakwit (Clean) by:  Beau-J & Furia
20:44  aL3x: LordDragon: sometimes i dont...i am not consistent
20:46  aL3x: i'm an extreme extrovert with social anxiety disorder; it's the universe's sense of humor at work :D
20:47  yazdmich: lol
20:48  LordDragon: aL3x, lolz
20:48  yazdmich: so youre an aspie?
20:48  yazdmich: you're*
20:48  aL3x: no
20:48  yazdmich: like, you have aspergers syndrome
20:48  yazdmich: oh
20:48  b3ny0-: I do
20:48  b3ny0-: and I hate the word "aspie"
20:49  b3ny0-: :P
20:49  yazdmich: why?
20:49  aL3x: aspie sounds better than asperger...i think
20:49  b3ny0-: well its a diagnose not a fashion statement
20:49  yazdmich: i know
20:49  aL3x: if i had it, i would totally wanna be caled an aspie
20:49  yazdmich: i have it
20:49  yazdmich: i love being called an aspie
20:49  yazdmich: make me fell like i belong
20:50  LordDragon: hmm, aspie sounds insulting. like calling a black child a "niglet"
20:50  yazdmich: it sorta gets you into a social group for the non-social
20:50  aL3x: yazdmich: how do you know you have it, i mean, like, how does it affect you? (i know very ittle about it)
20:50  LordDragon: the word sounds cute, but its meant to be mean, etc
20:50  yazdmich: no
20:51  yazdmich: aspie is an affectionate term within the aspergers world
20:51  yazdmich: i was diagnosed with aspergers just before i started grade 5
20:51  yazdmich: it all made sense
20:51  aL3x: i htink dawkins is an aspie
20:52  zer0rez: LordDragon: the only problem w/ that analogy is N is always a bad word, while aspergers is the name for the condition.
20:52  b3ny0-: perhaps we should start calling people with ADD "addies", and psychopaths "psychies"
20:52  b3ny0-: ;)
20:52  aL3x: i watched his film last night, The Root of All Evil?, and he was getting pwned by religious people, but not cause he wasnt right, but because he was so tenaciaouly trying to push his point
20:52 * Velociraptors are psychopaths and approve. 
20:52  yazdmich: why i dont have many friends, why im soooo smart with computers, but not so much with other stuff
20:52  LordDragon: lol
20:53  TheNumb: yazdmich: g33k
20:53  yazdmich: yess
20:53  yazdmich: well no
20:53  TheNumb: So, yes or no?
20:53  LordDragon: Velociraptors, yeah but your eyes cant see me if i dont move right :P
20:53  yazdmich: a geek is a wannabe nerd who is dorky, a nerd is a very smart person who fits into socity
20:54  LordDragon: you got that backwards
20:54  yazdmich: no
20:54  yazdmich: i got it correct
20:54  aL3x: yazdmich: context...where do you live
20:54  yazdmich: i am a nerd
20:54  zer0rez: LordDragon: you're thinking of t-rexes
20:54  Velociraptors: LordDragon: that's the big one :)
20:54  yazdmich: canada
20:54  aL3x: yazdmich: ok, LordDragon and i are in the us... and i see them as the opposite...so this might be a cultural word meaning discrepancy
20:54  LordDragon: nerds are socially awkward ppl who are very smart but dont fit in. geeks are smart, but also fit in to their social group
20:55  yazdmich: no
20:55  TheNumb: I'm from europe. Am I a Eurofag?
20:55  aL3x: dictionary time then
20:55  LordDragon: in fact geeks are very trendy these days
20:55  yazdmich: no
20:55  aL3x: yazdmich: dictionary
20:55  yazdmich: nerds are very trendy
20:55  b3ny0-: I am so scando
20:55  LordDragon: lol
20:55  LordDragon: aL3x, i dont know if yazdmich is trolling us or if hes just mistaken
20:55  Velociraptors: you both are
20:56  yazdmich: i use urban dictionary, it even has a freenode channel: ##urbandictionary
20:56  aL3x: nerd: an intelligent but single-minded expert in a particular technical field or profession
20:56  yazdmich: yes
20:56  aL3x: geek eccentric: a person with an unusual or odd personality
20:56  yazdmich: i am no troll
20:56  yazdmich: b3ny0-, try joining #wrongplanet
20:56  aL3x: LordDragon and yazdmich THERE is no univerally accepted term for either nerd or geek... soum
20:57  yazdmich: full of people with aspregers and autism
20:57  aL3x: anyways...why did we get on this nerd vs geek tangent
20:57  b3ny0-: I'll join #planetawesome instead
20:57  aL3x: to me, a geek is a nerd with style
20:57  aL3x: that is how I define geek
20:57  Velociraptors: what aL3x said, roughly - at least not as they're commonly used, which is in whatever way any of dozens of groups use them
20:57  LordDragon: aL3x, i agree
20:58  aL3x: nerd is wearing hte button up shirt and no style watching star trek...the geek is wearing sloppy clothes, cool tshorts. smokijg pit and watching star trek
20:59  LordDragon: geeks are technical minded but like things which arent really mainstream. at least thats how it used to be. these days geeks are IN, so its not really being different anymore, its being like everyone else :P
20:59  yazdmich: i dont watch star trek, i dont smoke anything and i get all the girls without even trying, i call myself a nerd
20:59  yazdmich: and i registered #planetawesome in my name
21:00  aL3x: yazdmich: no one gets ALL the girls
21:00  b3ny0-: good, I never went there, it is a silly place
21:00  LordDragon: aL3x, true. but lots of self centered insecure men like to PRETEND they can get whatever girl they want. it makes them feel better about themseleves ;)
21:00  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  how about those Macs eh?
21:01  aL3x: LordDragon: yeah, if they only knew it exposes them, they might stop making such claims
21:01  elb0w: i expose my self constantly
21:01  b3ny0-: I've had my first case of success with the "hard to get"-technique
21:01  elb0w: ;)
21:01  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i want a new mac pro :( but cant afford it.
21:02  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  any particular one?
21:02  Velociraptors: or just... newshiny?
21:02  aL3x: b3ny0-: hard to get usually means they dont really like you, but finally gave up or got drunk
21:02  Velociraptors: (cos tbh, new+shiny is enough for me :)
21:03  elb0w: how do you guys get girls wearing all black and sitting in starbucks all day?
21:03  LordDragon: Velociraptors, i was thinking of upgrading fromw hat i have now. i currently have a 4 core. so i was thinking a new 8core. i mainly want one with efi64, unlike my current 2007 mac pro
21:03  elb0w: haha 
21:03  b3ny0-: carefully executed
21:03  b3ny0-: I managed to get her to fall for me
21:03  b3ny0-: :)
21:03  elb0w: did you trip her?
21:03  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  go for 12 cores. You know you want it. 
21:04  LordDragon: Velociraptors, hahaha. you are a BAD INFLUENCE on me :P you make me want to empty my bank account lol
21:04  Velociraptors: well - yes
21:05  Velociraptors: wait. That came out too easily. 
21:05  aL3x: elb0w: iam the girl wearing all black and sitting in starbucks
21:05  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  I'd quite like a newie, but I'd also like to know what's causing the slowdowns in some situations on this Pro (the original octocore)
21:06 * aL3x is in starbucks right now in fact
21:06  vxla: aL3x: get me a re-fill on my chai please
21:06 * Velociraptors haven't been in a starbucks yet. 
21:06  LordDragon: Velociraptors, what sort of slow downs?
21:06  aL3x: vxla: um, i'm not the help :P
21:07  vxla: oh I figured that!
21:07  vxla: at least if you were on a computer at one of the 8 sb's that I have within 3 blocks of me here, you'd be getting yelled at by customers who are in a rush
21:07  Velociraptors: LordDragon:  running 25-30 desktop apps at once slows it down horrendously in some spots. It doesn't appear to have any resources entirely saturated, but swapping apps and opening files, especially, gives huge delays
21:07  vxla: lol
21:08  aL3x: vxla: where do you live? with taht kinda starbuck ration, la, ny or the bay is my guess
21:08  aL3x: ratio*
21:08  vxla: chicago
21:10  LordDragon: Velociraptors, wow i thought *I* was bad running 10-15 apps at once
21:10  LordDragon: 30 geez. that salot
21:10  Velociraptors: haha
21:10  Velociraptors: +++ convenience. 
21:11  Velociraptors: I'd like to find a way to measure memory bandwidth being used - to see if *that* is being saturated with so much going on in the machine
21:11  LordDragon: Velociraptors, maybe its disk swapping? i been thinking about replacing my boot drive with an SSD
21:12  Velociraptors: my boot disk is audible - and there's no HD noise, or disk use showing up in Activity Monitor
21:12  Velociraptors: and the swapfile sits on 64MB even when this is happening, too. 
21:13  Velociraptors: usually with 1-3GB free. 
21:13  vxla: define "sits on"
21:13  elb0w: aL3x, lol
21:13  Velociraptors: stays 64MB
21:13  vxla: there's nothing wrong with that.
21:13  Velociraptors: aye
21:14  vxla: the scheduler may have swapped out a process that is sleeping
21:14  Velociraptors: that's the minimal swapfile size - and swap used when this happens is ~8-16MB, so swap isn't the issue
21:18  LordDragon: ADT aL3x 
21:18  aL3x: LordDragon: i know right
21:18  aL3x: :)
21:19  gucko: guys is amazon an apple authorized retailer?
21:20  aL3x: amazon sells apple
21:20  aL3x: dunno if thats idendticla to being authorised or not
21:22  CPng|N: Unless they have some amazing deal, which is rare with apple hardware, I don't see the point
21:24 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
21:26  yazdmich: wow
21:27  yazdmich: about to upgrade to iOS 4.2, should i continue or is it not worth my time?
21:28  aL3x: only you can decide that :)
21:28  aL3x: i am all about upgrading...
21:28  yazdmich: iPod touch 2nd gen, will i get changeable homescreen backgrounds?
21:29  aL3x: yazdmich: not sure, i know the 8 gig 2nd gen, but with 3rd gen firmware has homescreen wallpaper
21:29  aL3x: not firmware, but baseband, or something
21:29  yazdmich: its the 8 gig 2nd gen
21:29  aL3x: yazdmich: yeah,but there are 2 versions of it...
21:29  yazdmich: ?
21:30  yazdmich: what do you mean?
21:30  aL3x: yazdmich: when the 3rd gen came out, the 8 gig 2nd gen got a different baeband or bottloader or something
21:30  yazdmich: i got it before the 3rd gen came out
21:31  aL3x: then you have the non sc model, or sm, or ssomehting...one sec i will help you find out
21:31  yazdmich: ok
21:32  aL3x: yazdmich: everything i am reading is saying no
21:32  aL3x: no homescreen wallpaper
21:33  LordDragon: aL3x, yeah no wallpaper
21:33  LordDragon: not on the 2nd gen
21:33  LordDragon: its too slow to handle it
21:33  aL3x: yazdmich: and here is straight from apple confirming it http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4205
21:33  yazdmich: wth
21:33  aL3x: yazdmich: jailbreak it
21:33  aL3x: i have had walppaer since the ipod touch 1st gen
21:33  yazdmich: too slow for a picture?
21:34  aL3x: yazdmich: jailbreak
21:34  yazdmich: thats crazy
21:34  aL3x: yazdmich: jailbreak
21:34  yazdmich: its under staples warranty
21:34  aL3x: then forget jailbreak, and really break it, and get it replaced
21:34  aL3x: :D
21:34  LordDragon: yeah u could jailbreak it and get wallpaper, but youd also make it insecure. so there are pros and cons
21:34  aL3x: jailbreak is just a software update...it's like installing an app...it doesnt void warranties
21:35  aL3x: LordDragon: :P
21:35  LordDragon: aL3x, sssshhh :P
21:35  yazdmich: it does
21:35  aL3x: LordDragon: insecure...PUH-LEASE ....lol
21:35  yazdmich: a jailbreak involves patching and installing a modded version of iOS
21:35  aL3x: yazdmich: so
21:35  aL3x: yazdmich: if things go wrong, you just restore
21:36  yazdmich: it voids the warranty
21:36  aL3x: yazdmich: how would they know
21:36  LordDragon: actually, jailbreaking DOES void the warranty. some say apple will never know if you reflash it with official OS before taking it in for service. but there are actualy logs left behind on the device that apple can see
21:36  aL3x: LordDragon: show me the proof of this
21:36  aL3x: LordDragon: the proof about the logs...i already know it voids the warranty
21:37  yazdmich: im waiting for my staples warranty to expire
21:37  LordDragon: aL3x, it happened to me. i jailbroke my iphone 3g. and years later, i found this tool that lets you explore the filesystem of iphones. and i saw this file called "jailbreak.log" even though i had done a complete restore a year ago
21:37  aL3x: LordDragon: then you can use that app and DELETE it
21:37  aL3x: :)
21:37  yazdmich: then i will jailbreak
21:38  aL3x: yazdmich: you are insane
21:38  LordDragon: aL3x, i did. but my point is even complete restore doesnt wipe out records that u jailbroke
21:38  aL3x: yazdmich: i wouldhnt have the patience to wait
21:38  aL3x: brb need to smoke

21:46 --- Channel ##mac was synced in 85 seconds
21:46  yazdmich: why cant itunes do that when it syncs my ipod?
21:46  yazdmich: really
21:47  Angostura: It does
21:47  yazdmich: it does not
21:47  Angostura: It does
21:47  vxla: uh yeah
21:47  vxla: it does
21:47  yazdmich: uh no
21:47  yazdmich: it doesn't
21:47  Angostura: Yours doesn't
21:47  Angostura: for some reason
21:47  Angostura: The rest of the world's does
21:47  Angostura: So how is your configured?
21:48  yazdmich: like the rest of the world
21:48  Angostura: PEBAK, then?
21:48  vxla: i found a good site that may help
21:48  yazdmich: and one reason i have not gone to linux, no iTunes
21:48  yazdmich: oh no you didn't!

21:49  yazdmich: i am no PEBKAK
21:49  yazdmich: PEBKAC
21:49  yazdmich: *
21:50  Angostura: So, exactly what are you claiming iTunes doesn't do?
21:51  aL3x: guess i am out...later all, including LordDragon bye
21:53  PeaMan: is there any way to install GCC on mac without xcode?
21:53  PeaMan: When I download xcode it wants me to register as a developer and pay a $99 fee
21:54  yazdmich: i didn't have to do that when i got xcode
21:55  Angostura: PeaMan: Registering as a Dev is free
21:56  Angostura: Well, the basic registration
21:56  PeaMan: Ah so it is. I had to scroll to the bottom.
21:56  Angostura: Sneaky huh ? :-)
21:56  yazdmich: yeah
21:57  PeaMan: A little. I had an iPhone developer license late 2008, and remember getting xcode online before I bought the license. I seen "mac developer license" and thought they started charging.
21:59  yazdmich: i wonder if any apple employees go here

22:03  anr78: Can one upgrade SSD and DDR on the new MacBook Air all by oneself?
22:03  yazdmich: ddr is a type of RAM
22:03  yazdmich: and no
22:03  anr78: yazdmich: I know (about ddr) :)
22:03  yazdmich: only an apple tech can put ssd modules in your air
22:04  anr78: yazdmich: ok. not the same as the mbp then :/
22:04  jen_: Hi Frogor, another day, another dollar!
22:05  yazdmich: mbp?
22:06  anr78: MacBook Pro
22:06  yazdmich: oh
22:07  PeaMan: Forgive me if I'm having a dumb day (or apple are confusing me), but when you go to http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html to download it asks to select either iOS Dev. or Mac Dev. I got a free account so I assume Mac Dev. When I click download I get access denied. So I assume Mac Dev. means for users who paid the $99 fee. I am confused :/
22:07  yazdmich: good thing i emailed myself a screenshot of my serial number incase my ipod update screws up
22:08  yazdmich: does your client accept DCC send?
22:08  yazdmich: ?
22:08  PeaMan: It'll be slow.
22:08  PeaMan: I'm going to dig out the disk. It'll be easier.
22:08  yazdmich: i can send you the file via dcc
22:09  yazdmich: ok
22:09  PeaMan: DCC will be slow for me, but thanks anyway.
22:09  yazdmich: why would dcc be slow for you?
22:10  yazdmich: cable?
22:10  yazdmich: or dsl
22:10  PeaMan: I've got a slow connection. Ironically I live in the center of the UK's second largest city ... and I can only get 5mb internet.
22:11  PeaMan: Download speeds are around 75kbps
22:11  PeaMan: afk 10 mins

22:51  yazdmich: iOS 4.2 officialy SUCKS
22:52  yazdmich: nothing new
22:52  yazdmich: i cant have find my ipod because its not supported
22:52  vxla: i thought one of the changes was being able to modify sounds for text alerts
22:52  yazdmich: its an ipod touc
22:52  yazdmich: touch*
22:52  vxla: ah
22:52  yazdmich: no sms
22:52  Angostura: not a bit snappier?
22:52  yazdmich: nope
22:53  yazdmich: lemme see RAM usage
22:53  yazdmich: an extra 16 MB is being used
22:54  yazdmich: no
22:54  yazdmich: well still
22:54  yazdmich: iOS uses more of my storage space
22:54  yazdmich: than 4.1 did
22:54  vxla: so why not roll back?
22:54  yazdmich: iOS 4.2*
22:54  yazdmich: i wont waste more of my time
22:55  yazdmich: i would rather jailbreak
22:55  yazdmich: but im not doing that yet
22:55  vxla: so then why bitch about it here?
22:55  yazdmich: to tell others that were thinking about upgrading
22:57  S_SubZero: 4.2 has been fine for me so far
22:58  yazdmich: well i bet you have multitasking
22:59  S_SubZero: apparently I do, to some extent
23:00  yazdmich: how can a jailbroken iDevice handle multitasking even if apple says the same device, an ipod touch 2nd gen cant handle it?
23:00  yazdmich: does the patching proccess also overclock the cpu?
23:00  S_SubZero: maybe there's "does it well"  "does it fairly well"   "kinda does it"  "wouldn't recommend it" and Apple only focuses on the "does it well" stuff.
23:01  yazdmich: well "does it fairly well" is ok with most people
23:02  yazdmich: i handle long division "fairly" well
23:02  Angostura: yazdmich: Apparently not - 4.2 works 'fairly well' for you
23:02  Velociraptors: yazdmich: more than likely Apple have a set of pre-defined measures of how well a device works, in total, across many usage scenarios. If it doesn't satisfactorily fulfil all of those, it gets no multitasking. That doesn't mean there aren't folk who'll find those disadvantages to be no problem (or whose use of the device may not even come across them)
23:02  Velociraptors: and if it works well for you, hurrah!
23:03  yazdmich: iOS 4.2 wroks well for me
23:03  yazdmich: works*
23:04  yazdmich: if it had multitasking, or atleast a changeable background on my device, i would be exctatic
23:04  yazdmich: if it had multitasking, or atleast a changeable background on my device, i would be exstatic
23:05  yazdmich: i still dont see how a graphic is more complex for the home screen than black
23:06  yazdmich: really
23:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Tomis]
23:10  Velociraptors: yazdmich: there was mention of that on a site where a fellow jailbroke an older iOS device to give it a picture homescreen. There was mention of the dropshadows and different text rendering in order to show text well against an arbitrary background - and on that device it made a noticeable difference in speed and memory use. 
23:10  Angostura: I was going to say - homepage pix could be a bit memory hungry
