00:00  Tomis: the utilities folder is something to be removed from most people's machines
00:00  Tomis: it's just taking up extra space
00:00  Tomis: just like that safari game
00:00  Tomis: i don't need that
00:00  bassliner: lol
00:00  crilly: hah
00:00  Tomis: now where's my internet exploiter
00:00  crilly: I'm loving Google Chrom
00:00  crilly: Chrome*
00:01  Tomis: is v.7 out?
00:01  crilly: errr i'm on 6 i think
00:01  crilly: so 7 might be beta or something
00:01  Tomis: i love how they're iterating the version numbers like mad
00:01  Tomis: maybe they're trying to play catch-up to IE version numbers
00:01  Tomis: and then they'll slow down once they get there
00:02  CPng|N: yup
00:02  CPng|N: nothing new there
00:02  crilly: lol
00:02  CPng|N: lame, yes. new, no
00:02  crilly: I think they're just developing stuff into it really quickly
00:02  CPng|N: cardboard, no. delicious: questionable
00:03  Tomis: ok so where the crap is the "check for update" feature in chrome
00:03  Tomis: it's not in any of the menus
00:03  CPng|N: it autoupdates
00:03  CPng|N: naturally you have checked prefs
00:04  crilly: I think it's completely hidden
00:04  Tomis: there's nothing in the prefs for it either
00:04  crilly: All behind the scenes, as it should be.
00:04  Tomis: horrible
00:04  crilly: There really is no need to manually check for an update if the software can do it its self.
00:04  Tomis: i hardly ever use it, i just want to start it and check for an update
00:04  crilly: it will check its self
00:04  crilly: which is a good job, because it seems you are too retarded to release it can do that its self Tomis and thus, it needs to do things for you
00:05  bassliner: software should be maintained in repositories that offer cryptographically signed packages. period.
00:05  crilly: because you're not a programmer
00:05  crilly: so you're a retard.
00:05  bassliner: then i'm a retard too, since i'm just a sysadmin?
00:05  bassliner: damn.
00:06  bassliner: what can i do?
00:07  crilly: Ah so FaceTime uses SIP+RTP.
00:07  crilly: I never bothered looking into how it worked previously.
00:07  crilly: bassliner: leave the channel.
00:07  Tomis: who
00:07  Tomis: 's server does it talk to to establish the connection though crilly 
00:08  crilly: Tomis: it would have to be Apple's or someone's server.
00:08  Tomis: i haven't looked into it
00:08  Tomis: perhaps the wikipedia will know
00:08  crilly: I'm reading now.
00:09  crilly: Nothing on there on how that works, but SIP is used to initiate the connection, but there has to be something in the middle for the IP address to be shared
00:09  crilly: the only thing I can think of is the phones use the GSM network to share their IPs, then connect directly?
00:10  crilly: but then I don't know of any GSM features that allow a set of phones to communicate "in the background, on the quiet" like that.
00:11  crilly: Only other way is both parties connect to a server and say "I'm mobile number abc and my ip is def. i want the ip for mobile number tyu"
00:11  crilly: the other device does the same thing, they find each other and connect.
00:12 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v Berzerker]
00:13  crilly: Tomis: STUN server
00:18  bassliner: Tomis: an update button is available from the about chrome window.
00:19  Tomis: yea, except that it's dimmed out and says "update server not available (error: 10)"
00:19  crilly: Tomis: It uses ICE to determine if STUN or TURN needs to be sued for the connection through NAT.
00:20  crilly: Tomis: working for me: http://cl.ly/292f5f5da6532fbf9a98
00:20  bassliner: Tomis: hmm. works here. maybe try to find out what error 10 is; are you behind a proxy?
00:21  Tomis: no, nore do i really care bassliner 
00:21  Tomis: it's just chrome
00:21  Tomis: at some point i'll give up and go download the latest version which i still won't use
00:22  bassliner: Tomis: i'm still mostly using firefox too, tbh.
00:22  Tomis: safari all the way for me
00:22  fleebailey33: safari ftw
00:23  Tomis: i try out all the browsers periodically, never find anything that beats safari for me
00:23  bassliner: lacks extensions and doesn't fit some of my needs, apart from that really a damn good browser.
00:23  crilly: Tomis: http://youshottheinvisibleswordsman.co.uk/2010/06/25/iphone4-facetime-and-open-standards/
00:23  fleebailey33: crilly: you pay for cloudapp?
00:23  fleebailey33: im giving it a month trial premium
00:23  crilly: Tomis: Brilliant explanation. I think there is a SIP proxy hosted by Apple you register too
00:23  crilly: fleebailey33: I use the free one mate. I don't need the feature CloudApp provides.
00:23  Tomis: safari 5 has extensions bassliner 
00:24  bassliner: Tomis: oh
00:24  Tomis: though it's still rather limited comapred to what firefox's extension system can do
00:24  Tomis: apple followed chrome's model on extensions from what i understand
00:26  Sebboh: jeffmr, you mentioned 10.5, and that .x updates are free.  What about the 10.3-->10.5 upgrade?  Is that free?  How?
00:26  jeffmr: don't think so
00:30  Tomis: 10.x.y updates are free for 10.x users Sebboh 
00:30  Tomis: 10.x to 10.z is always paid
00:31  Sebboh: ahh, ok
00:34  Tomis: yea, jsut ignore the 10 basically
00:34  Tomis: it means nothing
00:34  CPng|N: the real question is, is 10.3 -> 10.5 1 update or 2?
00:34  Tomis: you'd buy 10.5 CPng|N 
00:34  Tomis: done
00:34  CPng|N: well that's good
00:34  Tomis: but at this point, good luck finding 10.5
00:35  CPng|N: the internet has none?
00:35  Tomis: it's rapidly getting low supplies
00:35  CPng|N: lol
00:35  CPng|N: of downloads
00:36  Tomis: it's not sold in a downloadable form
00:36  Sebboh: I can't/wouldn't pirate for this project.  It's going into a business.  I'll just make them buy it.
00:37  Tomis: are they still using PPC macs?
00:37  Sebboh: Unless pirating is risk free. :P  ..Aren't there keys, or some such?
00:37  Tomis: no, it's a mac, there is no OS key
00:38  Sebboh: Tomis, this machine is used.  PPC g4.  Oh, it's a Mac, so you paid for the OS.  Loal.
00:38  Tomis: eww
00:38  Tomis: what speed g4?
00:39  Sebboh: Don't worry, I'll get the oldest version that supports java 1.5.  OR run linux on it.  We shall see.
00:40  Sebboh: All I really need is more or less POSIX style user accounts and Sun java 1.5.
00:40  Tomis: 10.5 needs a 867MHz or better
00:40  Sebboh: :)
00:40  Tomis: but 1GHz+ and 2GB+ is best
00:40  Tomis: if it's got less than 1GB i wouldn't bother
00:40  bassliner: Sebboh: will probably be a hard time configuring linux to your needs on such a machine but maybe it's worth it. keep in mind it will cost nerves and time.
00:41  Tomis: you can still get ppc ubuntu
00:41  Tomis: it's kept fairly up to date the last time i checked, though it's "community supported", not official
00:42  bassliner: i'd probably use debian or bsd on such a machine.
00:42  Sebboh: I know more about linux than I do OSX, bassliner, but thanks.  (I can't find ppc sun java 6 debs for ubuntu, but sun seems to have java6 ppc bins, so...)
00:42  Sebboh: s/debs/official packages/
00:43  bassliner: Sebboh: well me too, i'm mostly new to osx. i love the simplicity so far but i sometimes get to the limits of configurability.
00:43  Sebboh: Sometimes? :/  Searchlight is neat though, ctrl+space terminal <enter> :)
00:43  Sebboh: er, command+space.. heh.
00:43  bassliner: s/sometimes/often/
00:44  Sebboh: I may or may not need more ram. http://twitpic.com/2zlnpk <--screen
00:44  Tomis: spotlight Sebboh 
00:44  Tomis: ouch
00:44  Tomis: 512MB
00:44  Tomis: too little
00:45  bassliner: the last computer i bought has an ARM processor and 128mb ram. i'm surprised how fast this little bastid is.
00:45  bassliner: and it was CHEAP.
00:45  nomulous: Hey #mac, how do I pipe the output of find to open? find x | open doesn't work.
00:46  bassliner: nomulous: try find $DIR -name "*foo*" -exec open "{}" \;
00:46  [M]ax: >
00:46  bassliner: nomulous: keep in mind find uses _directories_, not files.
00:46  bassliner: err
00:46  bassliner: open, not find.
00:46  bassliner: nomulous: keep in mind open uses _directories_, not files.
00:47  nomulous: I thought it was possible with awk and I seem to remember using it to do exactly that, but it seems not to be what I remember it was
00:47  nomulous: bassliner: Open can open files just fine...
00:48  nomulous: But thanks, I'll try it
00:48  bassliner: nomulous: well the stuff in /Applications/ you can use open for from a terminal is directories. i'm just saying that because trying to use open to use the file contents of such a directory will very likely fail.
00:49  bassliner: nomulous: but probably you can use it for files with a specified default application or something, not sure.
00:49  LaraX: is there a way to make iTunes louder when it's already on the loudest but you can hardly hear something? I raised everything in the equalizer too
00:50  Tomis: that's it LaraX 
00:50  LaraX: :(
00:50  Tomis: oh, get info on the track
00:50  Tomis: options
00:50  Tomis: there's a volume adjuster there too
00:50  LaraX: it's for yesterday's keynote
00:50  LaraX: ok I'll look
00:51  bassliner: LaraX: fortunately, itunes is not using some nasty 400% fader that will not tell you when you get to the point of clipping.
00:51  bassliner: LaraX: (which vlc does)
00:51  crilly: anyone here really good with networking?
00:51  crilly: Tomis: only part of this FaceTime I don't get now is the discovery of each other, and getting through the NAT to find each other too.
00:52  Tomis: i just assume it's talking to some common server and negotiating from there
00:52  nomulous: bassliner: Thanks, that works perfectly. Any idea how to do it in the general case though? Using a standard pipe? Was I right about awk?
00:52  LaraX: Tomis: that might've helped a tiny bit but not really
00:53  Tomis: i think it has a compressor built in too LaraX 
00:53  Tomis: so if it's maxed to the point of clipping it's not going to go any further
00:53  bassliner: nomulous: open would have to support stuff from stdin, which it probably does not. you could easily write a wrapper script for that likely
00:53  spline: LaraX: raise the system volune 
00:53  spline: LaraX: or you have to adjust the sound loudness (cmd+i on it)
00:53  crilly: Tomis: It is, to a point.
00:53  spline: rest would require something like SRS iWOW 
00:53  spline: or adjusting the actual volume itself via iVolume 
00:54  Cam: Hey sexies.
00:54  spline: App/Util/Audio Unit* I think can raise the DB
00:54  LaraX: spline: I did, everything is on the loudest, Winamp's volume is fine but I can hardly hear this podcast in iTunes
00:54  crilly: Tomis: I think a SIP proxy will be needed for fining each other's details, but STUN/TURN and ICE are used for NAT traversal
00:54  spline: ah
00:54  Cam: Hi nico94 
00:54  spline: not sure under windows.. been a bit since I've had it on a desktop
00:54  crilly: nico94: Why are you querying everyone? what do you want?
00:54  Tomis: anyone know what the crap the deal is with the nico94 dude?
00:54  LaraX: bassliner: clipping means it can't get any loder than that?
00:55  bassliner: nomulous: for foo in $(find . -name "*sh"); do open "$foo"; done
00:55  Tomis: is it a bot or wtf?
00:55  Cam: Why is nico messaging me?
00:55  Cam: >.<
00:55  nomulous: bassliner: Thanks again.
00:55  Tomis: it keeps PMing me with inane nonsense like "hi"
00:55  LaraX: that's why all of you should be +g too :)
00:55  Cam: Tomis; I know..
00:55  LaraX: [21] 06:52:51 PM * nico94 ~nico94@p54A60676.dip0.t-ipconnect.de :is messaging you, and you have umode +g.
00:55  bassliner: LaraX: clipping is when the amplitude of a waveform gets to 100% and you try to push it to some even higher level. it's also known as distortion, which is anything but what you want when listening to music.
00:55  Cam: Tomis; 18:55 <   nico94> Not much.... Working on a big badass system... You??
00:55  FriedBob: I feel left out now.
00:56 * LaraX PMs FriedBob
00:56  Tomis: you responded to it?
00:56  bassliner: LaraX: the solution is to crank your amplifier (or buy a bigger amplifier)
00:56  Tomis: never do that!
00:56  Cam: Tomis; lolol
00:56  Cam: I can /ignore easily.
00:56  FriedBob: LaraX: You are welcome to anytime, BTW
00:56  LaraX: :p
00:57  FriedBob: Spoke too soon, just got the spammy PM
00:57  LaraX: louder* I meant
00:57 * Cam spams FriedBob's PM
00:57  crilly: Tomis: uPNP solves the NAT issue. I think a SIP proxy is used for identifying each device.
00:57  Cam: rawr :3
00:57  Cam: Tomis; he is sending me something :3
00:58  FriedBob: Hmmm.
00:58  LaraX: bassliner: I don't know if I have an amplifier, this is a PC laptop (Sony Vaio)
00:58  LaraX: maybe I should just use headphones to watch this then
00:58  bassliner: LaraX: you could try VLC, it will let you use values higher than 100% (but as just said, it will distort at some point without notifying you)
00:59  LaraX: do podcasts play in Winamp?
00:59  Cam: Tomis; he is making a webbie.
00:59  FriedBob: are they not just an audio file or an audio stream?
00:59  bassliner: LaraX: rss support for winamp is very very weak.
01:00  LaraX: FriedBob: I downloaded it
01:00  crilly: No with Podcasts you download the entire udio file
01:00  Tomis: tell 'em to post in the room and stop PMing people at random Cam

01:24  torchie: that's like so many less
01:24  Tu13es: no
01:24  crilly: ok, 13" then. i'm sure the 13" will be just as portable.
01:24  Tomis: or just a 13" macbook pro
01:25  crilly: I have a 13" MBP. It's a bit heavy in the rucksack on the motorbike
01:25  Tomis: they should really sell an iPad case with a keyboard in it
01:26  Tu13es: if i had to get a MBA, it'd be an 11", if for no other reason than the price
01:27  Tomis: lol
01:27  Tomis: or get any other 11" netbook for like $50
01:27  crilly: the price is indeed rather nice
01:27  crilly: I got my 13" MBP for the same price :P
01:28  torchie: well a 13" macbook pro is p much just a macbook air 13" with optical right
01:28  Tomis: lol torchie 
01:28  crilly: and an none-flash hdd
01:28  crilly: and more ports
01:28  crilly: and upgradable ram
01:29  torchie: isn't it just firewire and microphone
01:29  crilly: to 8GB
01:29  Tomis: and a usable ammount of storage, and CPU, and memory
01:29  torchie: oh
01:29  torchie: shit
01:29  torchie: that stuff
01:29  Tomis: the air is an iPod mac bascially
01:29  crilly: watch your language
01:29  torchie: yeah 8 gb ram p important
01:29  Tomis: it's completely uselss
01:29  torchie: but you know what's really good
01:29  torchie: 16 gb ram
01:29  crilly: maybe if you're still using ddr2 yeah
01:29  torchie: I dunno how useless can it really be
01:30  crilly: 4-8GB of DDR3 is pretty nice.
01:30  torchie: but 16gb of ddr3 would be nicer!
01:30  torchie: until you hibernate
01:30  Tomis: i hope they bring that auto-hibernate feature to all macs
01:30  Tomis: that would be nice
01:31  Tomis: better yet, let me just hibernate the thing on demand
01:31  Tomis: just hold shift and Sleep changes to Hibernate or whatever
01:31  torchie: I just want
01:32  torchie: to never see the beachball 
01:32  torchie: ever again
01:32  Tomis: loads of ram is a good first step torchie 
01:32  torchie: like 32gb loads :D
01:32  torchie: I mean 32gb would be nice but you know what's really nice
01:32  torchie: 64 gb
01:33  Tu13es: 64gb isn't bad but 128gb is pretty good
01:33  torchie: yeah 128gb is decent
01:33  torchie: but 256gb would be righteous
01:33  Tu13es: true, 256gb would be good, but 512gb would be a bit better
01:34  torchie: sure we could definitely do 512gb
01:34  torchie: but we could also do 1 TB
01:34  crilly: Actually you're both wrong - having the Starship Enterprise's main computer inclosed in a MBA 11" pwns.
01:34  crilly: kthx
01:34 * crilly goes to bed
01:34  Tu13es: sure, but part of me says, if you're gonna do 1 TB, might as well do 2 TB
01:34  torchie: why not!
01:34  torchie: then again if we do 2 TB why not go the whole nine yards and get 4 TB

02:18  KeeperOfTheSoul: when adding a file to iTunes, is there anyway to move rather than copy?
02:21  Tomis: no KeeperOfTheSoul 
02:22  Tomis: you'd have to turn off copy to library
02:22  Tomis: then select the added files and choose "consolidate files"
02:22  Tomis: but even then, it may do a copy, not a move
02:23  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah
02:24  KeeperOfTheSoul: also wish when I dropped an mp4 in to the podcast window it wouldn't add it as a movie :(
02:25  KeeperOfTheSoul: something like 6 or 7 clicks to change a movie to podcast
02:26  Tomis: get info, options, media type: podcast
02:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: Tomis: yup, which is 6 clicks, should be able to just drag it to podcasts, or add it directly to podcasts
02:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: 7 clicks if I don't have the movie window open at the time

05:50  Brian2898: what do you think of mb air
05:51  Branes: It's a fashion accessory, not a computer
05:51  Marvolo: same as the Dell Adamo
05:52  Marvolo: Except the Dell has a halfway interesting design, whereas the MB is solid aluminum colored and textured
05:52  Branes: Pretty much. Its only saving grace over netbooks is that's got a real processor (if you can call anything from Intel 'real' :))
05:53  Branes: I was hoping they were releasing a hybrid, an iPad in an Air shell.
05:54  Marvolo: I was fearing that actually. Reading about Lion, I was expecting to see more of an iPad interface
05:54  Branes: Lion will be the last OSX.
05:54  Marvolo: I saw the screenshots and saw that we could have multiple apps actually open at the same time, rather than just backgrounding

13:47  stix: Is it possible to install Ubuntu on my Intel-bases MB-Pro? All I find on google is about installing a virtual ubuntu - I am not interested in that.
13:55  CEnTR4L: Does anybody knows why wouldn't 10.6 NTFS native write on external HDD won't work? I have used the Terminal, added the UUID to the file, rebooted but still its read-only...
14:17 --- FITTEDRITT is now known as storkop
14:44  Branes: stix: A virtual Ubuntu is strongly recommended. Attempting to run it directly on Apple hardware (outside of a virtual machine) can lead to catastrophic CPU failure.
14:45  stix: CPU failure? It's just an Intel CPU, like I have in my other Ubuntu PC
14:45  Branes: stix: Do mot fall for the common assumption that Intel CPU = 100% standard; Apple's hardware is slightly but annoyingly custom, specifically the power management chip.
14:46  stix: hmm interesting. But is it possible to boot it on the ubuntu installation dvd and install it like on a normal PC?
14:46  _KaszpiR_: cpu failure lol wtf ever said that shit
14:47  Branes: Instead of using a normal, off-the-shelf SMbus controller, Apple built their own (the SMC) which forces the host OS to micromanage all subsystems' power requirements. Whilst this helps give OSX and their laptops the ability to get nine hours on a charge, it means only OSX and Windows (with Boot Camp) can control the chip properly.
14:47  Branes: Any other OS leaves the CPU in a permanently over-volted state,.
14:47  Marvolo: which leads to electron migration (bad)
14:48  _KaszpiR_: jesus
14:48  Branes: _KaszpiR_: It is something any good certified Apple technician will tell you; it is a known issue, but not one Apple see as a fault, and will not be rectified.
14:48  _KaszpiR_: apple really can fuck up everything
14:48  stix: that's just great
14:48  _KaszpiR_: anyway depends on overvoltage
14:48  _KaszpiR_: most cpuc can hande quite high overvoltage, but actually it should be controlled by bios etc
14:49  _KaszpiR_: and not from os level
14:50  stix: but hasn't something like this been integrated in the linux kernel then?
14:50  Branes: No, because the linux devive coders believe what Apple's hardware tells them. It lies.
14:50 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
14:51  stix: hmm okay
14:51  Branes: And being a proprietry chip, Apple refuse to release the specifications to the linux teams, and further muddy the waters by deliverately splitting the SMC code into three locations, making it extremely difficult to reverse engineer.
14:52  stix: okay, I think I'll drop this idea :)
14:52  Marvolo: virtualbox is a good way to go if you can get the guest additions installed correctly
14:53  Branes: OSX is a very good host-OS for virtualisation, even VMware have gone on record saying that. And for *nixes, Oracle Virtualbox is the most efficient, with less than 2% resource loading. Go full screen, and you'd hardly know you were running virtually.
14:53  Marvolo: That's how I've been doing my Visual Basic homework all semester
14:54  Marvolo: (and the only reason I ever run windows)
14:54  Marvolo: But i'm one of the few in the class that can say they have paused Windows
14:54  stix: yes virtualbox is great. But I need a linux with a physical NIC
14:55  Branes: stix: You can reroute a secondary onboard or bus NIC (such as a USB-to-ethernet adaptor) directly to the OS inside the virtual machine
14:56  stix: hmm that might be an idea then
14:56 --- Bensawsome is now known as Guest40862
14:57  stix: thank you for updating me guys :)
14:57  Branes: If you're wanting an unique wifi connection, a USB dongle would be the go; you can set up the VM so that the dongle is not seen by the host OS but controlled exclusively by the virtual'd OS.
14:58  stix: yes that is what I want then.
14:58  Branes: I know a couple of sharkers who do just that :)
14:59  stix: sharker?
14:59  Branes: wireshark-user, wifi sniffer, wtc. As a last bit of info, yes you can dual/triple boot Ubuntu on Apple's hardware, and provided you do *not* put the CPU under load, you should avoid any CPU problems.
15:01  stix: oh okay. I think I will go with the virtualbox and usb-wifi-controller
15:01  Branes: What normally happens, the SMbus looks after Vcore and as the CPU's delta-T (optimal operating temp) approaches zero, Vcore is reduced to equalise potential and reduce electron noise. Apple's SMC relies on the host OS to tell it to do that, a normal SMbus can do it by itself.
15:02  stix: okay, I see
15:03  Branes: You just have to keep an eye on the physical temperature of the machine itself; Apple's laptops are a thermodynamic disaster internally.
15:03  ksmith: hey guys. Has anyone used Wubi in a dual-booot setup to get ubuntu up and running?
15:03  Marvolo: You don't have to tell that to my thighs
15:03  ksmith: So that you have OSX, Win7 and Ubuntu to play with?
15:03  Branes: ksmith: Don't bother.
15:04  Branes: ksmith: Unless you like the idea of replacing a logicboard in your laptop every six months, run your Ubuntu inside a VM.
15:04  ksmith: Branes: What's going to happen?
15:04  Branes: CPU failure.
15:05  stix: ksmith, it's too bad you didn't join 20 min. earlier :) Branes has just explained it all to me
15:05  Branes: No Ubuntu (no linux distro, for that matter) can do the power-management stuff Apple's custom hardware requires, and your CPU is left over-volted. End result: death of CPU by "overclocker's cancer".
15:06  ksmith: Can't I just undervolt it then?
15:06  ksmith: that's what I do on OSX anyways.
15:06  Branes: No, because Apple don't provide access to voltage control.
15:06  Branes: Not through the BIOS emulation layer, anyway.
15:06  ksmith: ah, ok.
15:07  Branes: OSX can do it, because that's how they designed it - the host OS *must* micromanage the power, instead of leaving all that stuff to a semi-smart SMbus chip.
15:08  ksmith: ok, you got me convinced
15:08  ksmith: hmm
15:08  Branes: The newer the CPU, the faster it can die. If you've an original Core2Duo, go hard, they're indestructible.
15:08  ksmith: but what's happening when I'm running windows?
15:08  ksmith: 2,1 MacBook
15:09  Branes: If you've got the Boot Camp driver pack installed, then the SMC is being controlled by Apple software.
15:09  ksmith: I have
15:10  ksmith: and there's nothing like it for any linux distribution, ok.
15:10  Branes: Apple have done a good job of hiding what the SMC actually is (very very brain-dead).
15:11  ksmith: I think I can live without running linux.
15:12  Branes: It annoys the crap out of me because I'm one of the techs that have to swap out the logicboard, and that's one job I *really* loathe :)
15:12  ksmith: I just thought it'd be fun to play around with it a little.
15:12  ksmith: I feel your pain. I have torn apart the macbooks of my brother and mine and reassembled them.
15:12  Branes: Use a VM. Virtualbox 3 is the best for a *nix. Go full screen, and the resource load is around 2% ... you wouldn't know it's virtual.
15:13  richardcavell: I know when I'm virtualising
15:13  richardcavell: on a second-gen MacBook
15:13  richardcavell: everything slows down
15:13  richardcavell: host and guest
15:13  ksmith: hmm, when I use parallels for windows it's like I'm using a brick instead of a computer.
15:14  ksmith: booting takes like ... 10 minutes.
15:14 @Tu13es: need moar RAM
15:14  Branes: Not enough memory, or a fragmented "drive" would slow it down.
15:14  ksmith: hmm, 2GB.
15:14 --- Tu13es sets modes [##mac -o Tu13es]
15:14  Tu13es: yeah, I wouldn't virtualize with less than 4gb
15:15  ksmith: well, 3GB is the maximum for a 2.1 MacBook
15:15  Tu13es: 3GB, then
15:15  Branes: Going back to OSX 10.4 would also be a big help :)
15:15  ksmith: why's that?
15:15  Branes: Smaller memory footprint.
15:15  ksmith: just curious. is there any way to reduce memory footprint on SL?
15:16  Branes: Killing off Dashboard, Spaces and Spotlight make a *big* difference.
15:16  ksmith: hmm, I don't use dashboard and spaces
15:16  ksmith: but is there a viable alternative to spotlight?
15:17  Branes: Just because you're not using them doesn't mean they're not running.
15:17  ksmith: nah, I mean I'm gonna kill them right now. :)
15:17  Branes: Nothing that would work the same way, as a lot of Apple's programs depend on Spotlight. Mail, AddressBook, iChat, iCal, Safari, Finder ...
15:17  ksmith: hmm
15:18  ksmith: ah, is the window showing and switching thing also dashboard?
15:18  ksmith: the active corners
15:18  Branes: That's Exposé, and is controlled by Dock.
15:18  ksmith: ah, ok. I always confuse the two.
15:19  ksmith: so I just do "defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES" and it's gone for good?
15:19  FriedBob: Mornin'
15:19  ksmith: hi bob
15:20  Branes: That'll stop Dashboard from being summoned at boot/login, yes.
15:20  ksmith: nice :)
15:20  Branes: Nailing Spaces and Spotlight are harder.
15:20  ksmith: goodbye dashboard
15:20  ksmith: well, one step at a time.
15:20  ksmith: I'll keep spotlight.
15:20  ksmith: I really love it.
15:21  ksmith: but I don't use spaces at all.
15:21  ksmith: I don't know where the difference between switching spaces and windows should be
15:25  ksmith: hmmm
15:26  bassliner: "blablub wants permission to access information stored in your keychain to access $ip"
15:26  bassliner: interesting. would be meaningful to say WHAT exactly it tries to access
15:26  bassliner: i mean there's a good chance one has a proxy that also acts as a fileserver or something
15:26  ksmith: and the animation is a little rough on my macbook, too ... but anyway, I can't find any resources on how to disable it permanently.

15:43  ksmith: is it that much of a memory hog?
15:43  koro: dashboard? yea
15:44  FriedBob: I probably should kill it on this system... only 512mb ram
15:44  ksmith: it's like I put in 1GB of extra ram.
15:45  ksmith: seriously, parallels is kind of usable now.
15:45  FriedBob: I don't have to worry about parallels. Won't run on PPC macs.
15:46  ksmith: well, I need to edit a excel file every once in a while.

15:54  diffract|: i never had problems with my older macbook which had 2 GB
15:55  diffract|: i used vmware fusion and windows xp
15:55  ksmith: I'm using parallels with Win7
15:55  diffract|: :o
15:55  diffract|: why windows 7? you just need to run excel
15:55  diffract|: just use windows xp
15:55  FriedBob: ksmith: There are minor differences in the scripting syntax between OO.o and MS Office. OO.o can convert 99% of the time though
15:56  diffract|: also, vmware fusion is ahead of parallels as far as i know
15:56  FriedBob: Bootcamping it is also an option
15:56  diffract|: yes OO.o can convert; it's not guarnteeed that it's accurate
15:57  ksmith: because I won't buy myself a new windows if I already have windows 7 installed via bootcamp.
15:57  ksmith: a new old windows that is.
15:57  diffract|: do you really buy windows?
15:57  diffract|: who does that?
15:58  ksmith: is fusion able to boot from a hdd partition?
15:58  ksmith: I'm not going to discuss my opinion on pirating software.
15:58  diffract|: fusion stores creates a file for each virtual machine.. if you choose to put that file on another partition, sure

16:01  zer0her0: ah nice, how are you liking it so far?
16:01  zer0her0: and find me some food as well
16:01  FriedBob: It's rough on my feet and knees, but I like it.
16:02  FriedBob: Going from a desk job to being on your feet 5,10 or 12 hours a day kinda sucks.
16:02  diffract|: ksmith: suit yourself man.. win7 is too much for your ram, and there is no accurate way of converting an excel file with mac tools.. the best solution is to install a lightweight windows (xp) so that you can run excel on it.. if you find another solution, i'd be impressed
16:03  FriedBob: I guess there is also Office for Mac...
16:03  ksmith: I'm trying OO right now. the excel sheet I have to edit ain't no currency calculations or rocket science.
16:03  ksmith: won't work in this case, bob.
16:04  ksmith: I tried.
16:04  zer0her0: FriedBob: yea i hear ya, it sucks even if you don't go from a desk job ;)
16:04  FriedBob: zer0her0: On the plus side, it should help a lot with this weight I have been trying to lose
16:04  diffract|: ms office for mac is crippled
16:04  diffract|: it couldn't open a few word files that happen to contain formulas
16:05  ksmith: and it's crashing frequently ... at least the last time I was using it.
16:05  FriedBob: I run Win and Mac on different hardware, so it's not an issue for me.
16:05  zer0her0: FriedBob: right on, who needs a gym :)
16:06  OneFix_Work: So, anyone know how to force a Mac to renew its IP sooner than once an hour?
16:06  FriedBob: zer0her0: I still plan on joining one. Need to do some weight lifting to really reach my goals. The job will just provide the cardio.
16:06  FriedBob: OneFix_Work: Nope, I use perm leases on my LAN, so never need to renew.
16:07  zer0her0: haha, just lay down on some of the boards and start doing reps w/ 2x4s w/ paint buckets on the ends ;)
16:07  zer0her0: though you're only there for what 2 weeks?
16:08  FriedBob: 3 weeks in Building Materials, then 3 weeks in a different department, then 3 weeks in Receiving, then 3 weeks in Hardware, then hopefully I become an assistant department manager somewhere

16:09  zer0her0: FriedBob: that's cool though.
16:09  FriedBob: Don't press alt-J ?
16:09  ksmith: shintaku: it renders nicely in adium
16:10  FriedBob: zer0her0: Yeah, it's their MT program for rapid career training. Have to take a lot of tests and read a lot of policy and stuff too
16:10  shintaku: the problem is that i have some macros mapped to Alt+J that don't work because they see Alt+∆
16:10  zer0her0: FriedBob: cool, well glad you like it so far.

17:53  FriedBob: Unless you count phpmysql
17:53  elb0w: what is peoples obsession with phpmysql
17:53  elb0w: lol
17:54  FriedBob: I'm not obsessed. It's just the only non-windows specific mysql GUI I have used.
17:54  FriedBob: It's OK, but it's rather slow. especially the one that is used by Plesk
17:57  ayaz: elb0w: There's SequelPro.
18:05  elb0w: im gonna make it a project to port heidisql to as3 so its platform independent

18:32  richardcavell: Has anyone here got Internet Sharing working well?  I'm trying to get Windows 7 to share the Internet from my Mac and it just won't work
18:33  spline: dhcp the IP on the windows side
18:33  spline: usually the problem
18:33  spline: tail system.log to see the problems on the mac side/try to ping each bxo
18:35  richardcavell: Well the Windows 7 machine is 'Obtain an IP address automatically' for IPv4.  I unchecked IPv6.
18:38  spline: yeah it issues them via dhcpd when I've used internet sharing
18:39  spline: its a common thing where you're sharing <something> but I've shared over the years between a cross-over/wifi -- had the various issues 
18:40  richardcavell: I'm connected to Internet via Airport and my wired Ethernet cable is connected to a Windows 7 machine.  How do I ping the Ethernet cable rather than the Airport?
18:43  Seven: I have a Macbook , and the touchpad sometimes froze or responde slowly , the keyboard works all the time , im new at mac this my first one does anyone know what this can be ? ( i reistalled the OS but problem is sill here )
18:45  S_SubZero: if things are freezing or otherwise not working as you expect, take it back where you bought it and show them.
18:46  richardcavell: ok damn it I give up on this
18:46  _kafka: could anyone name few important differences betwen pc and mac for a photographer using photoshop?
18:46  diffract|: nothing much really
18:47  _kafka: just the stigma of stability ?
18:47  diffract|: the operating system helps manage your files and photoshop works about the same
18:47  richardcavell: don't they still use a different default gamma?
18:48  CEnTR4L: Does anybody knows why wouldn't 10.6 NTFS native write on external HDD won't work? I have used the Terminal, added the UUID to the file, rebooted but still its read-only...
18:48  diffract|: CEnTR4L: you have to install macfuse and ntfs-3g
18:48  spline: OSX used to standardize on 2.2 now 1.8 in 10.6
18:48  spline: I thought
18:48  diffract|: native mac doesn't do it
18:48  Tu13es: OS X only has read-only NTFS drivers
18:48  spline: im not into that part of OSX though but I heard something about it from a friend that does video work
18:49  spline: CEnTR4L: might also want to check ntfs3g that loads via MacFUSE
18:55  CEnTR4L: spline, diffractl, these software never helped but gave headache instead.
18:56  CEnTR4L: Are these the only ones?
18:56  CEnTR4L: I hate Apple for not enabling the native NTFS write on their 10.6.
19:02  diffract|: CEnTR4L: i've been using them and they've been working flawlessly..
19:03  CEnTR4L: on 64-bit?
19:03  diffract|: so i didn't have to look for other choices
19:03  diffract|: CEnTR4L: yes
19:03  CEnTR4L: Stupid question, are these freeware softwares or paid?
19:03  diffract|: free
19:04  diffract|: ntfs-3g has a paid version
19:04  CEnTR4L: Hmmm.
19:04  diffract|: but i never needed it
19:04  diffract|: probably more options
19:05  CEnTR4L: I'm confused since on the web some say NTFS-3G & MacFuse come together and some say they're separate...
19:05  diffract|: i've always installed them seperately.. macfuse first then ntfs-3g
19:05  diffract|: macfuse is developed by google
19:06  diffract|: ntfs-3g is by some other developers, so they're not very related
19:06  Branes: It's also a reverse-engineered effort, so there can (often) be stability, speed and compatibility issues.
19:07  CEnTR4L: Are they dependent on each other when it comes to NTFS writing or related? I've read your answer but again on the web some confuse you more.
19:08  diffract|: macfuse does not enable read/write on ntfs partitions
19:08  diffract|: it only allows file system drivers to run in user-space
19:08  diffract|: because support for file systems is normally done at kernel level
19:08  Branes: ntfs-3g is a FUSE module.
19:09  diffract|: yes
19:09  diffract|: so ntfs-3g does not have to mess with your kernel
19:09  Branes: You add MacFUSE to OSX first, this gives it the ability to use other file-systems.
19:09  diffract|: which can be dangerous if it's not stable
19:10  Branes: I wonder if that gdisk FUSE module still works ...
19:11  CEnTR4L: Branes, what is your opinion on the topic, I need to write on an NTFS so bad, using 10.6. I prefer freeware.
19:13  CEnTR4L: I have stumbled upon this forum thread, it has to way to write on a NTFS drive, I have used the first one before and it worked just great, it just won't work again for some reason... http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=785376
19:15  elb0w: Any rumors to a new iPad release date?
19:16  CEnTR4L: Knowing Apple, there's no way to find out.
19:16  elb0w: Damn I want to buy one but I feel like a new one will be released by xmas
19:17  Branes: CEnTR4L: I wanted stability, and I've been burned by the "you get what you pay for" approach too many times. I bought Paragon NTFS and have not regretted it.
19:17  Branes: "Free software is only free if your personal time is without value." :)
19:18  CEnTR4L: I think I would need one too, the company that I work in offers us unlimited technical books on the web from Safari Books, Books 24/7 & SoftSkills, its incredibly tempting!
19:18  CEnTR4L: I understand Branes.
19:19  Branes: If I want to use files on a Nuke This File System, I want them to be nuked *properly* :)
19:19  CEnTR4L: lol.
19:20  the_rogue_smiler: My mac PC's screen won't work.
19:20  Branes: The Paragon product is worth it -- it uses licenced Microsoft code, has full ACL and ADS support, full security permissions support, the works.
19:21  CEnTR4L: Good to hear, what does ACL & ADS stands for here?
19:21  Branes: And if you're wanting to share the NTFS drive with a Windows 7 environment, then Paragon NTFS 8 is what you really should use.
19:21  Branes: Access Control Lists, Alternate Data Streams.
19:21  CEnTR4L: I see.
19:22  the_rogue_smiler: Which mac pc is the best? (laptops)
19:22  CEnTR4L: Why would I want to share an NTFS drive on a Win 7, isn't native already or they have dumbed it?
19:22  CEnTR4L: Mac PC? you mean not Apple Mac?
19:23  CEnTR4L: This is AWESOME! the other way to write on an NTFS drive worked, its on the same thread post that I have shared earlier.
19:23  the_rogue_smiler: No, I meant mac pc
19:23  KaOSoFt: It's just $20.
19:23  KaOSoFt: I guess everything's cheap these days.
19:23  CEnTR4L: Apparently you didn't read the topic.
19:23  KaOSoFt: ;_;
19:23  CEnTR4L: Yeah.
19:25  CEnTR4L: Being Steve Jobs' Boss: http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_44/b4201096309840.htm
19:25  Branes: CEnTR4L: I mean, if you plan on using that NTFS volume with both OSX and a Windows 7 environment, then you should really be using the Paragon product because of the changes Windows 7 added to NTFS not being fully supported by ntfs-3g or Apple's barely-functional-and-known-to-be-buggy NTFS code.
19:26 * CPng|N agrees
19:26  CEnTR4L: Uha.
19:26  Branes: Apple turned it off for a reason.
19:26  CPng|N: blame microsoft
19:27  Branes: It's code that they didn't write, and they've tested it and found it to be un-trustworthy.
19:28  CEnTR4L: Branes, have you ever sent your CV to Apple, locally or in the US?
19:28  CEnTR4L: I bet you didn't.
19:29  CPng|N: CV?
19:29  CEnTR4L: Curriculum Vitae.
19:38  Branes: Why would I want to work for them? They're a horrid company to work for.
19:39  CPng|N: oh you work at a 3rd party repair shop? I always htought you did work for Apple
19:40  Branes: I'm an Apple-trained and certified technician, have been since 1981. I'm content to observe, kick them in the nuts when they deserve it, speak my mind, and fix their screwups :)
19:40  Branes: Last thing I want is to be another yes-toad.
19:41  Branes: Welcome back, Captain Carrot.
19:55  HackeMate: hello
19:55  HackeMate: what client can i use for ares network?
19:55  HackeMate: i tried Poisoned but i dont like it (because i wasnt able to make it work with ares network)
20:13  S_SubZero: Ares reminds me of DC++ which I miss.  It was like sticking my hands in a pirahna tank.  What could go wrong with sitting on a network full of not_a_virus.exe and mp3's hosted by the feds?

23:34  kithpom: hi all. Is there a way via keyboard shortcut to change the arrangement of files in finder? Like by modified date for example.
23:35  sr0z: whats wrong with your mouse?
23:36  kithpom: sr0z: my mouse is just fine and dandy, thank you. how about my question?
23:38  sr0z: hold on my mouse just stopped working, brb.
23:39  kithpom: is that supposed to be a joke or something?
23:40 * CPng|N shrugs
23:42 --- Felix is now known as FELIX
23:43 --- netdaemon is now known as NETDAEMON
23:43  kithpom: I find using the keyboard for most tasks is quicker and more efficient if you know the shortcuts. I also find certain things are just not possible on a mac without a mouse.
23:44  CPng|N: yep
23:44  CPng|N: unfortunately
23:44  CPng|N: that's one thing they should add to 10.7. But I wouldn't hold my breath
23:45 --- memenode is now known as MEMENODE
23:58  kithpom: CPng|N: I would think they should have shortcuts for like everything. Another one is connecting to a network share. There doesn't appear to be a way to click the connect button with the keyboard.
23:59  kithpom: I suppose one reason for less shortcuts is less clutter in the menu. less features for more advanced users.
23:59  CPng|N: Mac OS has always been a mouse oriented OS though
