12:26  knaaa: hi .. i use a darwin iso, to boot up mac os x 10 snow leopard in vmware, i use a dmg file, but the iso image is not recognized, can somebody tell me how to convert the .dmg file properly?
12:58  Guest13774: is there way i can transfer songs to ipod without itunes ?
13:02  DarkStar1: Guest13774: Ey?? Are you trying to get out of "jail" without the jailor's keys? :)
13:03  Guest13774: huh
13:03  Guest13774: you make it sound like i am trying to do something illegal
13:06  DarkStar1: Guest13774: Not at all I'm just trying to put your problem into perspective. It is possible to get out of jail without the jailor's keys.. but it'll be hard and you're not likely to come out unscathed

14:23  Marvolo: I didn't know that was possible until you asked just now. I just stumbled across this: http://ciaranwal.sh/2007/12/10/tab-switching-in-terminal
14:24  Marvolo: That doesn't actually answer your question though does it.

15:42  omicron23: hi there. How can I change the keyboard layout on os x? I have attached a standard pc usb keyboard to my mac, and I am not able to use keys like ALTGR+9 to create "]" .
15:42  omicron23: It is a german keyboard.
15:42  omicron23: And this keyboard does not have the mac layout.
15:45  crilly: In the System Preferences
15:47  omicron23: crilly: where exactly? I can find settings to choose between several languages and the corresponding layouts. However I cannot see how I can tell OS X that I am using a Keyboard that has no Mac Layout (no command button etc.)
15:48  Psy: Keyboard
15:49  Psy: omicron23: Language & Text if you're on Snow Leopard
15:49  Psy: and then Input Sources
15:49  Psy: but I doubt you'll find the layout you want
15:49  Branes: OSX will try to identify what sort of keyboard you have at boot time; if you use a Windows style keyboard (of any layout) the Windows key usually becomes the Command key.
15:49  Psy: they're only mac version of each layouts
15:50  Branes: Once it identifies the type, you are asked for a suitable language layout
15:52  omicron23: well yes. The windows key became the command key. So it seems as if OS X always thinks it deals with mac layouts... It would be really nice if there were a way to tell os x to treat the connected keyboard not as a mac one, but a general pc one.. 
15:53  Branes: You need to boot the machine with the foreign keyboard connected.
15:53  Psy: I doubt he will be able to have alt gr + 9 inputing ] though
15:55  Psy: omicron23: there's no PC layout for Mac, you'd have to build it yourself or get used to the Mac layout

16:28  Branes: Don't be an ass. That's not possible, the lowest an original iMac can run is 8.0
16:29  crilly: waffle: Mac OS and OS X will only install on hardware within their "range". That is, if you try and install OS 7 on hardware it considers too new, it won't work.
16:45  waffle: is my macs hardwhere too new for mac os 7.5.1
