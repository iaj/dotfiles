00:15  Alexookah: hello can i ask...  how i could test if my hardware is capable running hackintosh snow leoparD?
00:18  [Kevin]: hackintosh isn't supported in here
00:35  dimm: can i use my imac for test webserver (apache+php+mysql), or better choise is install virtual machine (linux guest) and test webserver on it ?
00:37  CrypticSquared: you can use your mac if you want
00:38  CrypticSquared: some people hate using the bundled apache etc. you could use xampp or the likes or even install your own setup via macports/homebrew
00:38  CrypticSquared: no need for a VM
00:41  Fedayk1n: yeah a lot of people just install MAMP locally and test there
00:41  Fedayk1n: or in a bare bones VM

04:46  Tomis: try movign the asian characters to the end and see what happens
04:48  temhawk: lol that changes it
04:49  Tomis: maybe they just like the way asian text looks in that other font for some reason
04:52  temhawk: i can't think of any other reason, so I will agree with you
04:56  EoN: what's the slimmest, slickest most low profile/thin, unobtrusive cover available for the iPad?
04:57  Fedaykin_: eon a sticker
04:57  Fedaykin_: its probably the utf conversion
04:58  Fedaykin_: double byte text and ascii characters,  vs utf8 standard font, then dbe text
04:58  Fedaykin_: its likely as simple as that
05:00  EoN: lol
05:04  EoN: so many of the covers i've seen are just horrible bulky ugly disgusting pieces of sh*t
05:05  EoN: trying to find a nice one
05:05  CPng|N: a good cover is the one they ship with it
05:06  EoN: mine was a gift. but most reviews tell me the default cover is a terribly cheap sack of crap
05:06  EoN: and from the photos, it looks hideous
05:06  CPng|N: not a fan of metal huh
05:07  Fedaykin_: it ships with a cover?
05:07  CPng|N: a case
05:08  CPng|N: metal on back, glass on front. protects the circuitry pretty damn well
05:08  Fedaykin_: oh right right
05:08  Fedaykin_: http://www.zagg.com/invisibleshield/apple-ipad-cases-screen-protectors-covers-skins-shields.php
05:08  Fedaykin_: thats the smallest most unobtrusive

05:14  EoN: yeah i agree generally. i dont have a cover on my iphone. but ipad will potentially be knocking around in a bag

05:17  EoN: sexy -> http://droconcepts.com/ipad/shield-carbon-fiber-ipad-case.html
05:19  EoN: CPng|N is right though. these POS's will become outdated soon enough. may as well enjoy the slickness in the mean time. a perfectly unscratched ipad in 2 years will be useless
05:19  CPng|N: exactly
05:19  Fedayk1n: pretty much
05:20  Fedayk1n: the only reason I'd get a case is to protect it from things breaking the screen
05:20  EoN: yeah
05:20  CPng|N: maybe just a clear semi-flexible sticker placed on it carefully  so that you barely see it or notice the thickness. once the sticker gets gross, replace it or just take it off cuz as you said, after a few years you won't give a crap
05:21  CPng|N: the screens are supposedly very safe from scratches, and a glare reducer won't save it fgrom a 4 foot drop onto concrete
05:21  Fedayk1n: 's why I like teh dodocase
05:21  Fedayk1n: that and it looks like a moleskine
05:22  CPng|N: the one thing that's nice with an ipad is if you get a case like the apple one, where you can prop it up at 30 or 60 degrees, or cover it to carry it (especially if you slip it into your backpack or something a lot)
05:22  Fedayk1n: eggsactly

16:25  LzrdKing: just rewire the light directly to a power source, and it'll never blink again
16:25  navs: so are we talking krav maga and tactaleneck?
16:25  MrUnagi: LzrdKing: the light means something silly
16:26  LzrdKing: oh
16:26  LzrdKing: so that fixing is important
16:26  navs: lol
16:26  Necrosan: I heard that Gucci Mane knows Krav Maga
16:26  MrUnagi: basically lol
16:38  MobGod: dumb ? how do I do a ctrl alt delete on a mac

16:38  Tomis: it has the shortcut listed there
16:40  MobGod: not that one sorry 
16:40  MobGod: my brother installed orb and I want it gone 
16:40  Tomis: since when does control-alt-delete uninstal programs?
16:41  navs: but the process is still running somewhere? You want Activity Monitor
16:41  Tomis: just quit the app in question, then drag it to the trash
16:42  MobGod: Tomis I can't quit it 
16:42  MobGod: that's the problem 
16:42  Tomis: activity monitor
16:45  MobGod: where is that 
16:45  Tomis: spotlight it
16:45  Necrosan: yeah, spotlight it.

16:46  MariachiAC: What irc client do people here recommend for the mac?
16:46  Tomis: colloquy is the only usable free IRC client IMO
16:46  simplicity-: Linkinus. It's not free tho.
16:47  MariachiAC: I liked linkinus, but it does not have good voiceover support currently.

16:49  MariachiAC: I'll look into those clients. for now i'll use mac-irssi
16:49  Tomis: then drag it out of the dock MobGod 
16:52  MobGod: its up top Tomis 
16:52  Tomis: it's in the menubar?
16:53  Tomis: then you haven't killed it, it still has a process running
16:53  Tomis: or it's using a native menuextra
16:53  Tomis: try command-click and dragging it out of the menubar
16:55  MobGod: nope
16:55  MobGod: its like stuck or something 
16:55  MobGod: its next to the WiFi icon 
16:56  Tomis: if you can't cmd-drag it, then it's a running process
16:56  Tomis: which means you can kill it from activity monitor
16:56  MobGod: I did 
16:56  MobGod: errfr 
17:01  MobGod: Tomis look http://db.tt/wu7YtzP
17:03  Tomis: i see a few 3rd party background apps there MobGod 
17:04  Tomis: Cab***, netsession****, FPV**** possibly, Audiogalaxy, LMI*** i don't recognize either but it could be some crappy printer driver for all i know
17:09  MobGod: I just want to kill orb 
17:18  MrUnagi: whoa mobile hotspot included on verizon iphone
17:18  MrUnagi: thats kinda huge
17:20  Tomis: what's that mean
17:21  MrUnagi: it means you dont have to pay extra for mobile hotspot
17:21  simplicity-: Not just tethering? An actual hotspot?
17:21  MrUnagi: only mentioned hotspot
17:22  simplicity-: That is pretty cool, and battery draining :P
17:22  MrUnagi: plug it in
17:24  MrUnagi: now i have a decision to make

17:34  MrUnagi: no
17:35  MrUnagi: maybe....if i knew the question
17:36  darkdev: I just installed original SL with EasyEFI, but when I loading system (with -v flag) I have: ATY_init: map IO memory failed. What can I do?? I tried to use old NatitX, but it isn't working
17:37  Tomis: what mac is it on darkdev 
17:37  Tomis: if you're trying to dual-boot with linux, i'd advise just putting linux in a VM, avoid all the hassle
17:37  darkdev: I have a Hackintosh - Pentium IV, ATI x1300 Pro 256 mb
17:38  Tomis: ah, well then, bugger off until you've bought a mac
17:38  Tomis: mac os x requires a mac
17:38  Tomis: have a nice day
17:38  MrUnagi: lmao
17:38  darkdev: Sorry, but I have Leopard and it's work
17:38  Tomis: no
17:38  darkdev: Why SL doesn't?
17:39  simplicity-: Because it's hackintosh.
17:39  MrUnagi: bye bye darkdev 
17:39  simplicity-: Now understand that hackintosh is not allowed in here.
17:39  Tomis: because it needs a mac
17:39  MrUnagi: because you are cheap
17:39  Tomis: http://store.apple.com buy a mac, and come back
17:39  darkdev: Sorry)

17:39  Tomis: oh well
17:39  Tomis: try linux if you're tired of windows
17:39  MrUnagi: get a job
17:40  darkdev: I'm tired of linux too...
17:40  Tomis: sell the PC, invest the money in some shares of Apple
17:40  MrUnagi: darkdev: get a job
17:40  Tomis: wait a year, and you'll be able to afford mac!
17:40  MrUnagi: Tomis: you think it will go up that much?
17:40  Tomis: apple is their own economy
17:41  Tomis: they'll be bailing out the US government soon enough
17:41  MrUnagi: lol
17:41  Tomis: maybe offer a loan or two to microsoft
17:41  darkdev: Thanq!)) I'll get job and buy it))

17:50  MrUnagi: hmmm
17:50  rayfinkle: facebook sucks
17:50  MrUnagi: what is its purpose?
17:50  rayfinkle: (trollin time)
17:50  Tomis: to boost people's egos
17:50  Tomis: like all "social networks"
17:51  rayfinkle: adult friend finder?
17:51  MrUnagi: what are social networks
17:51 * Tomis smacks MrUnagi with a wikipedia
17:51  MrUnagi: strangely i know everything
17:51  MrUnagi: even false information makes sense now
17:51  MrUnagi: how odd
17:53  CyberdogX: think i'll sell my clamshell 466
17:53  g4bittin: CyberdogX: if its near Sweden, and the price is right i might want it = )
17:53  CyberdogX: it's in the US
17:53  navs: I hate adult friend finder. I mistakenly signed up and messed up my profile so now I get updates on all single men in my area
17:53  g4bittin: ah
17:53  CyberdogX: ha!
17:54  CyberdogX: keep an eye on the competition
17:55  CyberdogX: how much would shipping to sveden be ya?
17:57  simplicity-: How much would you want for it?
17:57  g4bittin: dunno, to much i guess
18:00  CyberdogX: it's a Graphite 466 SE, 576mb ram, N wireless, two yo-yo's, hockey puck usb mouse. in stellar shape too.
18:01  CyberdogX: what do you think it's worth?
18:01  Tomis: n-wireless?
18:01  fujisan: navs are you sure you didnt mistake heterosexual with homosexual or bisexual?
18:01  simplicity-: $5
18:01  CyberdogX: usb external
18:01  Tomis: via usb dongle?
18:01  CyberdogX: works great
18:02  CyberdogX: keep going higher simpicity
18:02  simplicity-: $20!
18:02  CyberdogX: higher
18:02  simplicity-: no can do, i'm a poor bastard.
18:02  CyberdogX: until it starts to hurt
18:03  simplicity-: Everything hurts.
18:03  CyberdogX: everybody hurts
18:04  CyberdogX: sometimes
18:05  MobGod: Tomis u on Twitter
18:06  MrUnagi: so......if everyone switched to mac, how long before we would see viruses and malware
18:06  Tomis: never MrUnagi 
18:07  Tomis: by the time that happens, iOS will be the dominant OS
18:07  MrUnagi: i dont want to think about that
18:07  Tomis: the mac is just a legacy system for pro users
18:08  MrUnagi: as long as they will still have os x, then thats ok
18:08  fujisan: MrUnagi: you wouldnt see those
18:08  fujisan: ignorance is bliss :D
18:08  MrUnagi: see what
18:08  fujisan: no virus scanner no market for virus scanners or companies to keep up with virus definitions Et Cetera
18:08  S_SubZero: what prompted this conversation
18:09  fujisan: you need paranoia in a certain extend to be or remain secure i reckon
18:10  MrUnagi: i cant understand why people put up with malware
18:11  S_SubZero: (a)they dont understand it, (b)they don't care, (c)they don't actually put up with it
18:11  MrUnagi: all of the above
18:12  Tomis: well now that the mac app store is here
18:12  Tomis: the likelyhood of that problem is much lower
18:12  MrUnagi: i dont have that yet =)
18:12  Tomis: app vets the apps beforehand
18:12  torchie: app
18:12  torchie: app corp
18:12  S_SubZero: The "does the things I need to do" value is high enough that the "might get malware" value isn't considered.
18:12  S_SubZero: \
18:12  Tomis: no more telling someone to google for an app
18:12  Tomis: and finding they went and downloaded somethign else
18:12  S_SubZero: also, cost.
18:12  CyberdogX: don't forget stupid
18:12  CyberdogX: you can't count out stupid
18:12  Tomis: what cost
18:13  Tomis: you find the app, you purchase it
18:13  S_SubZero: No I mean
18:13  S_SubZero: $999.00
18:13  S_SubZero: 6 or 12 month special financing options
18:13  S_SubZero: that cost.
18:13  torchie: wat
18:14  Tomis: huh?
18:14  torchie: what would be great is a distribution channel not under apple's control
18:14  S_SubZero: like my friend.  Lower income, big family, kids in school, etc.
18:14  torchie: but apple just calls that "safari"
18:14  CyberdogX: buying a macbook?
18:14  S_SubZero: She can't buy Macs for the family.  She can't buy $999 devices for the kids.
18:15  S_SubZero: so "malware" is ok, because malware is cheap.
18:15  Tomis: gross
18:15  Tomis: those kids don't need computers anyway
18:15  S_SubZero: She uses a P3 for crying out loud.  It's depressing
18:15  Tomis: if they do, they can go get a job
18:15  torchie: hey man P3 rocks hard
18:15  MobGod: Tomis u on Twitter
18:15  Tomis: teach 'em the value of money
18:15  Tomis: no MobGod 
18:15  torchie: run em hard
18:15  torchie: teach em how to shave with a straight razor
18:15  Tomis: i'm self-absorbed enough as it is
18:15  torchie: have em do manual labor in a factory
18:16  Tomis: hell yes torchie 
18:16  Tomis: have 'em make that macbook in china with their own hands
18:16  S_SubZero: Her family has interesting issues, such as: Hầu hết các gia đình không thể nói được tiếng Anh
18:16  torchie: throw em off a cliff to some wolves 
18:16  torchie: only take em back if they kill
18:16  Tomis: what S_SubZero ?
18:16  S_SubZero: Tomis: exactly.  You can't read it, employers can't read it.  It's all they speak.
18:17  Tomis: what language is that
18:17  S_SubZero: Vietnamese
18:17  Tomis: aren't they an american colony now? didn't we win that war?
18:17  Tomis: why aren't they all speaking english
18:18  torchie: english is the html5 of human languages
18:18  S_SubZero: the lower income "fresh off boat" crowd is an interesting demographic.  A lot of the "well just do this" mentality that us white capitalists apply to our lives, don't work for them
18:18  torchie: maybe vietnam is still running
18:18  webPragmatist: i have a question… i end up having to run /usr/sbin/sendmail to submit emails and just have it sit there in the terminal
18:18  torchie: NETSCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPE
18:18  webPragmatist: can i run this as a daemon somehow?
18:18  torchie: S_SubZero: maybe they should just
18:18  torchie: do that

19:36  tf87: is there a system kind of like exchange AutoDiscover.xml or thunderbird config-v1.1.xml ?

21:25  MrUnagi: thats ok
21:25  MrUnagi: i still love you
21:25  CPng|N: well didn't it just come out a couple months ago? but like I said, it's your fault if you jumped and bout an ipad 1 and the flaky verizon hotspot puck instead of waiting a few more months for iPad 2 
21:25 +zer0her0: just saw your real vzw ipad response
21:25 +zer0her0: awe, i still love you
21:25 +zer0her0: :)
21:25 * MrUnagi hugs zer0her0 
21:25 * zer0her0 hugs back
21:25 +zer0her0: CPng|N: huh
21:25 * MrUnagi hugs harder
21:26  CPng|N: zer0her0:  eh
21:26  User901: so does anyone have any ideas as to how i can get my termainl app working again?
21:26 * zer0her0 feels ribs snap
21:27  CPng|N: remove that command from launchctl?
21:27  CPng|N: what did you add?
21:27  MrUnagi: User901: how did you break it
21:27  CPng|N: maybe nuke/rename your . files in ~
21:27  CPng|N: ie: .bashrc .bash_profile
21:28  User901: i don't have access to anything anymore is there another way to stop processes in the launchctl
21:28  User901: i have already removed my . files 
21:28  CPng|N: weird
21:28  User901: and i have tried other shells
21:28  CPng|N: man that's F'd
21:28  User901: can seem to get it working
21:28  CPng|N: your normal Terminal still runs bash?
21:29  CPng|N: log in as another user and test it.  Naturally you have an admin tyupe account that you've never mucked iwth... ;)
21:29  CPng|N: if not, now's the time to make one!
21:29  User901: goot idea
21:29  User901: i'll try the root account
21:42 --- hubbard.freenode.net sets modes [##mac +v ChrisAM]
21:52  MrUnagi: how can i put commands in a bash script to run in an ssh session
21:52  MrUnagi: for instance in the script ssh user@host.net; echo hello.......where hello is displayed after the ssh
21:54  CPng|N: uhmm
21:55  CPng|N: Not sure but I'm thinking it's -c ?
21:55  CPng|N: nope, not for ssh. that's for bash I think. hmm
21:55  CPng|N: you can create an automated script which ssh's in and runs things
21:56  CPng|N: using "expect" which you may have to install on mac. I forget
21:56  CPng|N: nope, seems to be there
21:57 +crilly: -c is correct for the client
21:57  CPng|N: problem with that method is that you still have to enter your passord every time, or save it directly into the text file. but you already ahve to do that for ssh anyway
21:57 +crilly: hmmm
21:57 --- ChanServ sets modes [##mac +v LaraCloud]
21:57  CPng|N: according to `man ssh`, -c is "-c cipher_spec"
21:58 +crilly: Yeah I was just looking at that my self.
21:58  CPng|N: actually it says just put the command at the end
21:58  CPng|N: so maybe try putting "echo hello blahblhablah" in quotes
22:00 +crilly: hmm that would indeed be odd
22:00 +crilly: On Linux I think it's -e
22:00 +crilly: er
22:00 +crilly: -c
22:07  CPng|N: hmm.  I did "ssh user@mysite.com ls -laFtr"  and it worked just fine (did a long dir listing sorted by time)
22:07  CPng|N: I even did this just fine:  ls -laFtr; echo hi dude.  did a dir listing and printed "hi dude"
22:08  CPng|N: I think MrUnagi just needs to remove that ; after the site name
22:08  MrUnagi: cool
22:08 +crilly: Good find CPng|N 
22:09  CPng|N: I miss working with ssh and using it to forward ports. Makes you feel special when the rest of the company has no idea how you did it
22:13  CPng|N: 1Password++
22:14  simplicity-: ?
22:15  MrUnagi: does crontab use vi by default?
22:27  CPng|N: I think it uses your EDITOR env variable. or something similar
22:28  CPng|N: "-e      Edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables."
22:28 * CPng|N thinks MrUnagi needs to use "man" more
22:30  MrUnagi: i do if i know what i am manning
22:30  MrUnagi: oh
22:30  MrUnagi: yea
22:30  MrUnagi: sorry thought we were talking about the other question
22:31 --- snoopy is now known as Guest39961
22:31  MrUnagi: hmmm still confused
22:32  MrUnagi: what are those environment tables
22:32  MrUnagi: ill googl
22:32  MrUnagi: e
22:34  CPng|N: environment variables
22:34  CPng|N: run "set"
22:34  CPng|N: change it with something like "setenv EDITOR /path/to/lame/editor"
22:48  MrUnagi: omg 3 times in 2 minutes someone comes up to the desk and takes my phone off the cable
22:54  snufft: hey guys

23:51  Fedayk1n: MrUnagi: if you cat the whole log,  unless part of your process is log pruning you'll create drop lines for the same IPs over and over
23:52  Fedayk1n: plus,  you should verify that sudoers log differently than password for root
23:54  MrUnagi: Fedayk1n: the only string i am looking for pertains to unsuccessfull root log in attempts, which i will never do
