01:23 --- ihateyou is now known as lewellyn
01:24  Pawnee: You really need two desktops or two monitors to be emulated? Or do you just wanna use split screen for two programs?
01:44  Vaevictus: hey guys... is password reset still recovery disc and easy?
01:44  Cam: Yes.
01:44  Vaevictus: awesome
01:44  Vaevictus: someone told me 10.4 'increased security' ... but knowing the unix bits made me think otherwise.  thanks for the info
01:45  Vaevictus: can you recover with a wrong version?  like 10.4 disc on 10.5 or visaversa?
01:45 +Branes: nuh-uh.
01:46 +Branes: OS versions have to match
01:49  koro: oh boy. itunes is such a genius.
01:49  koro: Who would have guessed that "sync movies" meant "please delete all my songs without prompt and then sync my movies"

03:07 @ChrisAM: not me
03:08  Prynce: ....
03:08 @ChrisAM: only issue I'm having is gpgmail not working.
03:08  Prynce: I have another issue of my main monitor desktop background defaulting to the original background too
03:09  Prynce: and it won't let me change it
03:09 +Branes: Prynce: Reboot from your OSX Install DVD, launch Disk Utility, and from the first-aid tab do a repair-disk followed by repair-permission.s
03:09 +Branes: Prynce: And do it *now*. The longer you try to run your OSX in its damaged state, the worse the damage will become.
03:10  Prynce: branes alright, doing so
03:38  beterraba: i can't open .jar files on my mac x. could somebody help me?
03:38  mEck0: exit

03:47  Prynce: Branes, u around
03:48  Prynce: So I want to say thank you for the tip
03:48  Prynce: it appeared to be broken worse then I realized
03:48  Prynce: but the repair disk fixed it
03:49  Prynce: And after I rebooted I rename the partition back to its original name
03:50 * Prynce forces a time machine backup
03:52 +Branes: Prynce: Good to hear
03:52  Prynce: tnx, I'll have to check the other computer
03:54 * Prynce ponders
04:02  proprietarysucks: does anyone know why system_profiler might fail for root but work for users
04:02  alexlea: not i
04:03  Marctraider: hi
04:03  alexlea: hi
04:03  proprietarysucks: it just fails with Assertion failed: (KERN_SUCCESS == kr), function -[SPDisplaysDevice initI2C:], file /SourceCache/SPDisplaysReporter/SPDisplaysReporter-116/SPDisplaysDevice.m, line 72.
04:03  proprietarysucks: and then Abort trap
04:04  Prynce: tried repair disk?
04:04  proprietarysucks: however with a user it just works fine
04:04  Marctraider: is it known that the standard color scheme of mac is a little yellowish on my macbook pro ?
04:04  Prynce: from install disk
04:04  Prynce: looks at proprietarysucks 
04:04  alexlea: my macbook is yellow cmpared to my bf's pc
04:05  alexlea: his looks more blue
04:05  Marctraider: ok
04:05  Prynce: Marctraider, don't think so BUT I do know from 10.5. to 10.6 they change the ummmmm dang it I cant think of the word
04:05  Marctraider: I calibrated my monitor (with the expert settings) and moved the white balance slider just a little to the right. it seems better now. 
04:05  Prynce: err
04:05  Marctraider: Not too blue not too yellow
04:05  proprietarysucks: apparently it's a known issue with updating to 10.5.6
04:06  proprietarysucks: god what a piece of shit
04:06  Marctraider: lol
04:06  proprietarysucks: this os sucks so bad
04:06  Marctraider: 10.6.5 you mean?
04:06  Prynce: proprietarysucks, I didnt come hear to listen to you whine....
04:06  proprietarysucks: constant experience of 'man this will be easy' followed by 'they did it HOW? what?? WHY!'
04:06  Prynce: I came her to help ppl find fixes and get fixes
04:06  proprietarysucks: and to sing crappy songs
04:07  Marctraider: O.o
04:07  proprietarysucks: anyways I'm outtie cheers
04:07  Marctraider: lol
04:07  Prynce: good riddens
04:07  Marctraider: Weird.
04:07  Prynce: totlly
04:07  Marctraider: I didnt have problems with updating to 10.6.5 although there werent much fixes that I needed.
04:07  Marctraider: anyway
04:07 @ChrisAM: something tells me that proprietarysucks isn't using Apple hardware.
04:08  Marctraider: mhh...
04:08  Marctraider: now why do you think something like that ;p
04:08  Marctraider: does that mean hackintosh?
04:08  Prynce: ah thats the word, they changed the gamma settings in 10.6 from 10.5, but there is a way to set it back
04:08 @ChrisAM: yeah
04:08  Prynce: ChrisAM, ROTFLOL
04:08  Prynce: 100 points goes to ChrisAM 
04:09  Prynce: My MAC just worksssss!!!!
04:09  Marctraider: mine 2 :]
04:09  Prynce: unless I screw it up
04:09  Marctraider: No probs anymore
04:09  Prynce: :D
04:09  Marctraider: Everything works fine.
04:09  Marctraider: NTFS and all..
04:09  Prynce: Well I just had to do a repair disk after my 10.6.5 upgrade
04:09  Marctraider: Although Firefox crashes from time to time but thats because i run the beta 7 64bit
04:10  Marctraider: prynce: how come?
04:10 +Branes: Marctraider: If you've done a proper calibration of your laptop's internal screen, yes, you will have a slightly yellowish tinge -- this is necessary to counteract the LCD panel's 18-bit limitation.
04:10  Prynce: my main volume as fooobared lots of issues.... may have been foobarred before the upgrade
04:10 * Prynce suspects
04:10  Marctraider: branes: well the yellowish thingy was actually there with the most standard profile. and now i just calibrated it myself and it removed the yellow part a little
04:11  Prynce: but repair disk from install disk worked like a charm and fixed it
04:11  Marctraider: And i like it more like this ;)
04:11  Prynce: heh
04:11  Marctraider: prynce: yeh good riddens
04:11 +Branes: Marctraider: Just so you are aware, no laptop screen is capable of true-colour display
04:11  Marctraider: branes: the blue standard aqua theme was a little yellowish as well. its no how it should be.
04:11  Marctraider: branes: I am aware ;)
04:12  Marctraider: Thats why the artists and designers mostly use CRT's. right?
04:12  Prynce: Branes, what about LCD or LED TV's?
04:12 +Branes: Marctraider: CRT, or quality flatscreen LCD, yes.
04:12  Marctraider: yup
04:12  Prynce: Branes, does that include IMACS?
04:12 * Prynce ponders
04:13 +Branes: Prynce: Depends on the price. And there's no such thing as an LED flatsreen (well, apart from the monster stadium screens, that is)
04:13  Marctraider: prynce: i think they are even more expensive than that. I mean, a loose screen might cost you quite alot :p
04:13  Prynce: Branes, I'm talking the NEW LED Tv's    those are flatscreen
04:13 +Branes: Prynce: The current-shipping iMacs all use 24-bit, true-colour LCDs. it's partly why they cost so much.
04:13  Prynce: ah I c
04:13  Prynce: nice
04:13 +Branes: Prynce: Nevertheless, they are not LED.
04:13  Marctraider: branes? and the macbook pro's dont?
04:13 +Branes: They are LCD, but with LED backlighting.
04:14  Marctraider: because they are 'pro' i assumed they are true colour as well :p
04:14  Prynce: Branes, hmm they dont use crt's, well some still use some
04:14 +Branes: Marctraider: No, they don't, because a true 24-bit LCD screen consumes three times as much power as an 18-bit.
04:14  Marctraider: ohh ic
04:14  Prynce: lol
04:15  Prynce: this is all interesting to know
04:15  Marctraider: then my mac is lieing to me :p 32-bit colour (well minus the 8-bit alpha channel that is)
04:15  Prynce: haha
04:15  Marctraider: 24 :)
04:15  Marctraider: That was a joke :p
04:15 * Prynce hopes his IMAC is snappier while playing WoW!!!!
04:15  Prynce: :P
04:16  Prynce: sorry had to say it
04:16  Marctraider: omg O.o
04:16  Prynce: >.>
04:16  Marctraider: World of Warcraft 'o'
04:16  Marctraider: -.-
04:16  Prynce: Cataclysm is coming soon
04:16 +Branes: Marctraider: The graphics chip can display 24-bit, the built-in LCD cannot.
04:16  Prynce: changed quite a bit since vanilla
04:16  Marctraider: I know, but i've seen all my friends go addicting to the game
04:16  Prynce: Marctraider, meh some ppl have issues
04:16  Marctraider: yeh
04:17  Marctraider: with the game :p
04:17  Marctraider: lol

04:17  Marctraider: then you must be an exception
04:17  Prynce: but not all ppl can manage themselves
04:17  Prynce: mst can
04:17  Marctraider: I know :p
04:18  Prynce: Marctraider, just gotta keep your priorities straight
04:18  Marctraider: Yeh
04:18  Marctraider: This dude i know has been playing WOW for like years... since the beginning. And like 12 hours a day
04:18  Marctraider: or more.
04:18  Prynce: we have a motto in my guild "Real Life Comes First!"
04:19  Marctraider: I will never be seduced by such games. Never Ever.
04:19  Prynce: Marctraider, yeah thats too much, I know years ago I went through a period of time where I got lost in WoW! like a few months while I was unemployed at the time
04:19  Marctraider: I've tried WoW once, because a friend kept wining about it for me to try, and after one hour, i'd had it.
04:19  Prynce: Marctraider, meh.....the fun comes at maxlevel
04:20  Marctraider: I'm more of the CS:Source and Garry mod from time to time (like 2 hours a week) :)
04:20  Marctraider: no not even at max level. Not for me.
04:20  Prynce: lol
04:20  Marctraider: Some people just don't have what it takes to play those games.
04:20 * Prynce should buy civ5
04:20  Prynce: for his mac
04:21  Marctraider: I like watching Startrek and all, and I've tried that Startrek MMORPG for 1 hour... it was horrible.
04:21  Marctraider: the graphics, the movement, AWEFUL
04:21  Prynce: Marctraider, I used to play UT4, but I cant getthe MAC version...
04:21  Marctraider: The only part which was ok was flying a ship
04:21  Marctraider: oh
04:21  Prynce: Marctraider, you should try it again in about 6 months to a year
04:21  Marctraider: why?
04:21  Marctraider: The phaser battles were horrible too :/
04:22  Prynce: Marctraider, its not anything close to what it was when it launched
04:22  Marctraider: ok :p
04:22  Prynce: and in abotu 6 months they'll have fleet bases aka guild housing :)
04:22  Marctraider: but those games are really not for me, and I wont spent a cent to it :p
04:22  Marctraider: lol
04:22  Prynce: Marctraider, to be honest I have a sub for STO but I dont play it much...lol
04:23  Prynce: I should just buy the lifetime and get it over with
04:23  Marctraider: lol yeh

05:28  derp: Bingo
05:28  derp: But it can be in english, as long the predominant language is french
05:28  derp: like a BIG FONT
05:28  derp: for french
05:28  derp: a slightly smaller for english
05:29  richardcavell: right
05:29  richardcavell: Is there anyone in Quebec who doesn't speak English?
05:29  derp: Well, english speakers are a minority in Québec
05:30  derp: They're in Montréal, eastern québec, in small communities across québec
05:30  derp: but that law doesn't affect indian reservations
05:30  derp: so they are free to choose wich language
05:30  richardcavell: When you say English speakers are a minority, I'm sure there are plenty who speak both
05:31  derp: Bino
05:31  derp: bingo
05:31  derp: plenty
05:31  derp: but as you move north of Québec, you'll see people with broken english
05:31  derp: :P
05:32  derp: But that same law has been challenged many times in court
05:32  derp: some parts went up to the canadian supreme court
05:33  derp: Espically the education part
05:33  richardcavell: right
05:33  richardcavell: Well what would be taught in schools?
05:33  derp: some french parents wanted their children to go to public english school
05:33  richardcavell: Do they teach English and French at public schools?
05:33  derp: yes
05:33  derp: they do
05:33  richardcavell: at all of them?
05:33  derp: all of them.
05:34  derp: If it's a french school, the english is a second language
05:34  derp: if it's a english school, french is second language
05:34  derp: the law requires that if both parents were under french public school, said children must be enrolled in french school
05:34 --- FELIX is now known as Felix
05:34  derp: that was the original law
05:35  derp: they fought so if one parent is english they can choose wich school
05:35  derp: Altough they later found a loophole to allow french children in english schools
05:36  richardcavell: So what percentage of schools teach maths in French?  how many teach in English?
05:36  derp: that's a really good question
05:36  derp: if it's a french school
05:36  derp: math is in french
05:37  derp: Altough private schools aren't covered
05:37  derp: they can have a english intensitive math
05:38  derp: Parents found out that if they send ONE child to a english PRIVATE school for one year makes its little brothers & sisters eligible for english school
05:39  derp: It's quite fucked up
05:39  derp: I gotta go
05:39  derp: ni ni <3

08:55  musicanna: I know chmod was used for permissions at one point, but I don't know if it's the current favorable command to do that with
08:56  MariusAZ: There's a whole slew of crap you have to do to do a permissions repair on OS X from the command line
08:56  MariusAZ: You have to start services and stuff

12:34  YingFan: Hi, I have two different partitions on different disks of different type having same UUID. How can this have happened and how do I change one of them?
12:34  YingFan: It makes my mac pro boot only like every other time :(
13:00  richardcavell: YingFan: How'd you manage that?
13:00  richardcavell: Crikey
13:00  YingFan: That's what I'm wondering
13:01  YingFan: I haven't set them manually or something
13:02  YingFan: only thing I can think of is that I added the uuid to the com...boot plist because it kept randomly putting sda and sdb in different order
13:02  richardcavell: ok
13:02  richardcavell: I don't want to advise you because I don't want to stuff up your machine
13:03  richardcavell: However, my instinct would be to boot your computer into Linux to do it
13:03  richardcavell: Ask in #ubuntu or something
13:03  YingFan: manually set the uuid you mean?
13:04  YingFan: I saw that somewhere while googling, can't it be done from OSX?
13:04  richardcavell: I dunno

23:34  MariusAZ: Oh

23:34  MariusAZ: That sucks
23:34  alexlea: they claimed it would be longer, but i never completely trusted them
23:35  alexlea: but anyway, bf got a new laptop, and we replaced all our tires, got some new stuff...etc...so it was worth it
23:35  MariusAZ: That's not really a trust thing though, that's just the way things go sometimes
23:35  MariusAZ: That's cool
23:35  alexlea: also, i might be getting a macbook air
23:35  alexlea: i can afford one
23:35  alexlea: i just dont know if i wanna get one now, or wait until after Lion

23:36  alexlea: MariusAZ: yeah, thats why i am holding off...i might wanna get the 13 inch pro insteaed,,which i cant afford, but as soon as i get 200 bux i can
23:36  MariusAZ: Cam:  No, the Air netbook
23:36  Cam: Oh thank god :P
23:36  Cam: Dos anyone know when Lion is being released?
23:36  MariusAZ: I'm sure it'll run like shit on Lion too though
23:36  MariusAZ: Next summer
23:36  MariusAZ: 2011
23:37  alexlea: i really want a 16:9 screen
23:37  alexlea: and i think the pros will have htat soon
23:37  Cam: alexlea; width:height?
23:37  alexlea: ALL hte pc people have 16:9....my bf's laptop is 6:9 and its bad ass
23:37  MariusAZ: the pc people suck though
23:37  alexlea: Cam huh?
23:38  Cam: alexlea; 16:9 is the width:height ratio?
23:38  alexlea: Cam: oh..yes, yes it is
23:38  Cam: Just wondering.
23:38  alexlea: the macbook 11 is 16:9, the 13 inch is still 16:10
23:38  alexlea: MariusAZ: pc's are  WAY cheaper though
23:39  MariusAZ: You get what you pay for
23:39  alexlea: the trade off is they dont have as nice of cases; spec wise though they are about the same
23:39  alexlea: apple stuff is sturdier
23:39  alexlea: and prettier
23:39  MariusAZ: I've spec'd out both PC laptops and desktops, part for part as far as performance they're almost exactly the same price
23:39  alexlea: but my bf doesn't care...he just wants toplay need for speed, fate, and card games...
23:40  MariusAZ: Other than the Mac Pro, that thing is way overpriced
23:40  alexlea: yeah
23:40  alexlea: mac pro=bad value
23:40  MariusAZ: The 12 core I can build a much better machine for about 1/3rd the price
23:41  alteregoa: yes?
23:41  alteregoa: how?
23:41  alexlea: the main thing i prefer about apple is the screens are nicer, (which thats gotta be an osx thing, cause i have compared pc's with IDENTICAL resolution and size) and the cases
23:41  alteregoa: you know i like to pay the price of an apple with 5k
23:41  MariusAZ: Buy the parts retail from NewEgg
23:42  MariusAZ: alexlea:  LG makes the displays, Dell uses the same displays
23:42  alteregoa: the main thing is SOFTWARE DUDE
23:42  duh: does anyone know how to install open realty on mamp?
23:42  alteregoa: the hardware is secondary
23:42  alexlea: MariusAZ: i had a toshiba, with the exact same screen....but it looked horrid...it was running windows
23:42  MariusAZ: alexlea:  The 27" high ppi display you can get much cheaper from Dell, same exact LCD panel
23:42  alteregoa: and a mini mac is much better compared to an equal
23:43  alexlea: i wishmy macbook didnt have the crappy 950gma...that is hte ONLY thing that makes me need to replace it
23:43  MariusAZ: Surprisingly though, the MacBooks have really crappy displays in them
23:43  MariusAZ: I think they're still using 6 bit panels in them
23:43  alexlea: i have a core 2 duo, 320g hard drive...2 gigs ram (can upgrade to 3)...but that 950gma
23:43  MariusAZ: Even in the pros
23:43  alexlea: ugh
23:43  MariusAZ: I think the high res one is 8 bit
23:43  MariusAZ: the 15"
23:44  alexlea: my display looks way better than the first macbook unibody (non pro) display
23:44  alexlea: MariusAZ: as far as i know even he whote  macbook is using the 8 bit now
23:44  MariusAZ: The display on my old Powerbook G4 1.67 was a huge piece of crap
23:44  thelostpatrol: the unibody mb had a terrible display
23:44  thelostpatrol: i remember buying one, took it right back 'cause of that
23:44  thelostpatrol: got this mbp instead
23:44  alexlea: thelostpatrol: yeah, it sucked
23:44  thelostpatrol: (best upgrade i ever made)
23:44  alexlea: it was worse than my white macbook....
23:44  MariusAZ: Almost every one of those produced was defective, had strange pixel problems
23:44  thelostpatrol: yeah it was pretty bad
23:45  thelostpatrol: this mbp however, is beautiful
23:45  thelostpatrol: even though it's from that time that they had nvidia card problems
23:45  alexlea: i dunno if i have  6 or 8 on mine...mine is not led though
23:45  Citrus: I am getting a CPU OVERTEMP led when i turn my Mac Pro on
23:45  thelostpatrol: i got lucky and mine wasn't one of the faulty ones
23:45  Citrus: how can I fix it?
23:45  thelostpatrol: alexlea, it's likely six but that doesn't mean it's bad
23:45  MariusAZ: Citrus:  Where is that light at?
23:45  thelostpatrol: my imac has 6 and it looks fine
23:45  MariusAZ: Citrus:  It's either a bad temp sensor, bad CPU, or bad logic board
23:46  MariusAZ: Citrus:  Sorry, thought you said Macbook Pro
23:46  alexlea: thelostpatrol: your imac is not led right?
23:46  thelostpatrol: nope
23:46  alexlea: i ask, cause i am wondering if he bits matter more when its led lit
23:46  thelostpatrol: it's from 2007
23:46  alexlea: cause the non pro unibody macbook looked HORRID
23:46  MariusAZ: Citrus:  I would try replacing the temp sensor first, if that doesn't work, replace the CPU
23:47  thelostpatrol: they do matter in the amount of colours displayable
23:47  Citrus: http://imgur.com/oTPtJ.jpg
23:47  thelostpatrol: but the best thing about LED is the depth of the colours, i think
23:47  Citrus: how can I replace the temp sensor
23:47  thelostpatrol: they just look better
23:47  alexlea: to me, the 15 inch mbp (and now current 13 inch mbp) 8 bit led look the same as my (most likely 6) non led
23:48  alexlea: my bf's new laptop is LED lit
23:48  thelostpatrol: dwhat's your mb model?
23:48  thelostpatrol: -d
23:49  alexlea: macbook 2,1
23:49  alexlea: but i have a screen from a late 2009
23:49  alexlea: butmy old screen looked the same
23:49  alexlea: wait, late 2008 i mean
23:49  duh: no mamp help here?
23:50  MariusAZ: duh:  That would be a #apache thing
23:50  alexlea: late 2007...damn, i dont even know what year it is now
23:50  duh: okay thanks
23:50  alexlea: its 2010...um....it would have been the macbook that came out dec the same year as leopard
23:50  MariusAZ: duh:  Or #php, or #mysql
23:50  MariusAZ: Depending on what part
23:50  duh: lots to choose from then :P
23:50  duh: installing open realty
23:50  duh: no help googling it 
23:51  Citrus: how can I replace the temp monitor on the mac pro?
23:51  MariusAZ: Citrus:  Temp sensor?
23:51  MariusAZ: You buy a new one
23:51  MariusAZ: Sounds like you need to take it to the Genius Bar
23:52  alexlea: if one has to ask how to replace it, one should most likely not do it htemselves
23:53  MariusAZ: exactly
23:57  Citrus: but I am out of warranty
23:57  alexlea: you could "pay" for a repair
23:57  MariusAZ: Then, you're probably going to have to pay to get it fixed
23:58  MariusAZ: Or buy a new computer
23:58  Citrus: I am good with PC repairs
23:58  alexlea: Citrus: then download your mac pro's service manual
23:58  MariusAZ: Ok, I'm staying out of this
23:58  MariusAZ: hehe
23:58  alexlea: Citrus: if know how to do this stuff, but just not hte details, then you need a service manua;
