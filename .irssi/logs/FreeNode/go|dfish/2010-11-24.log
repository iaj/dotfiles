13:46 go|dfish: http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.37/lib/Spreadsheet/WriteExcel/Examples.pm#Example:_csv2xls.pl
13:46 go|dfish: i think there is a csv2xls utility that ships with the Perl module Text::CSV_XS anyways
13:48 iaj: hmm i need to know how to install those CPAN modules on my OSX here
13:48 iaj: do you happen to have a clue
13:48 iaj: oh and thanks btw :)
13:48 go|dfish: oh my
13:48 go|dfish: asking ##linux while using OSX!
13:49 iaj: sure.. the #OSX guys don't happen to know as much concerning terminal stuff
13:49 go|dfish: Excel can open csv, you know this, yeah?
13:49 iaj: yeh :pp  Ofc. i do.. i just don't want to be forced to open .csv in excel/oo in order to save it as .xls
13:49 go|dfish: ok cool :)
13:49 go|dfish: ok
13:50 go|dfish: well, the best way is probably to use local::lib
13:50 go|dfish: one sec
13:51 iaj: hmmm :-) alright
13:52 iaj: thanks a lot for your help
13:52 iaj: so far :D
13:54 go|dfish: do you just have your system Perl installed?
13:54 go|dfish: you don't use 'homebrew' or anything
13:54 go|dfish: or macports
13:54 iaj: are you into mac osx? wow
13:54 iaj: i think its system perl
13:54 iaj: sec
13:55 go|dfish: yeah
13:55 iaj: yeah system perl...
13:55 go|dfish: i recently got a macbook pro :(
13:55 iaj: really?? woohoo
13:55 iaj: why :( ?
13:55 iaj: i got one as well
13:55 iaj: but I like it, pretty much actually
13:56 go|dfish: yeah me too 
13:56 go|dfish: best hardware i've ever bought
13:56 go|dfish: even if you do pay a bit more for the spec you actually get
13:56 go|dfish: well ok, they say not to mess with your system perl, because it may break things
13:56 go|dfish: so that's why this may seem a bit complicated
13:56 go|dfish: it installs the Perl stuff into your $HOME
13:57 go|dfish: the modules that is
13:57 go|dfish: so it doesn't mess around with your other stuff
13:58 go|dfish: http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~goldfish/pmi
13:58 go|dfish: that will install the perl module local::lib, which allows you to install perl modules into $HOME easily
14:01 iaj: sory was afk
14:01 iaj: one sec
14:01 iaj: oh you just wrote that bash script?
14:02 iaj: i don't use .bashrc... im using zshrc
14:02 go|dfish: ok
14:02 iaj: does that cause any problems/
14:02 go|dfish: just replace it with zshrc
14:02 go|dfish: or just run the commands one by one
14:02 go|dfish: if you want
14:02 go|dfish: and leave out the last one
14:02 iaj: k
14:03 iaj: curl -O http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/A/AP/APEIRON/local-lib-1.006008.tar.gz
14:03 iaj: is that file really existing?
14:03 iaj: doesn't seem to get curled.
14:03 go|dfish: bleh
14:03 go|dfish: i guess the link is wrong
14:04 go|dfish: sorry, didn't test this, i already have this set up here
14:04 iaj: hehe I see :)
14:04 iaj: no problem man
14:04 go|dfish: ah
14:04 go|dfish: it needs
14:04 go|dfish: curl -LO
14:06 iaj: the yes | thing is a nice one :D
14:06 iaj: ok installing
14:06 go|dfish: yeah :)
14:06 iaj: or rather... compiling
14:06 go|dfish: it asks you lots of bullshit questions
14:06 go|dfish: very annoying
14:06 iaj: do you want to really execute 'rm -rf /' ?
14:06 iaj: it just asked :(
14:06 iaj: ;)
14:06 go|dfish: you're joking, right?
14:07 go|dfish: lol
14:07 iaj: would be fun tho
14:07 iaj: lol
14:07 go|dfish: haha
14:07 go|dfish: revenge against mac users!
14:07 iaj: do I have to use that perl5/perl thing then?
14:07 iaj: in my ~/perl5 ?
14:07 go|dfish: did that stuff install?
14:07 iaj: sec
14:08 go|dfish: well you use it yes, but you need one more thing
14:08 go|dfish: not sure how familiar you are with perl
14:08 go|dfish: you use the 'cpan' command for install modules normally
14:08 iaj: seems a like
14:08 go|dfish: but there is a newer version someone wrote
14:08 go|dfish: to make it easier to install things locally
14:08 go|dfish: which is what we're setting up here
14:08 iaj: ok make threw some warnings i guess.. but make install worked out
14:08 iaj: i see..
14:08 iaj: thanks :)
14:08 go|dfish: hm ok
14:09 go|dfish: well you need the
14:09 iaj: http://pastebin.com/xxdKKyvw
14:09 go|dfish: echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.zshrc
14:09 iaj: looking good?
14:09 go|dfish: looks ok cool
14:09 iaj: ok at the bottom of my zshrc I got a eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib) now.
14:10 go|dfish: ok
14:10 go|dfish: start a new zsh
14:10 iaj: done
14:10 iaj: now?
14:10 go|dfish: and it should not pop any errors at you
14:10 iaj: it didn't.
14:10 go|dfish: ok, cool
14:10 go|dfish: now you need the cpanm client
14:10 go|dfish: curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm
14:10 iaj: cpan is installed tho
14:10 iaj: ok 
14:10 go|dfish: i made ~/bin/ and put it in there
14:10 go|dfish: yeah, you don't want to use cpan
14:11 iaj: chmod a+x cpanm ?
14:11 go|dfish: yep
14:11 iaj: done
14:11 iaj: nxt :)?
14:11 go|dfish: then cpanm Text::CSV_XS Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
14:11 go|dfish: to install those 2 modules, and their deps (it's only a few)
14:12 go|dfish: then there will be a csv2xls in the examples/ directory where Text::CSV_XS
14:12 go|dfish: you can use: find ~/.cpanm/ -name csv2xls
14:12 go|dfish: to get it's location
14:12 iaj: installing modules to ~/perl5/
14:12 iaj: that's correct eh?
14:12 go|dfish: yep
14:14 iaj: /Users/iaj/.cpanm//work/1290604331.64687/Text-CSV_XS-0.76/examples/csv2xls
14:14 go|dfish: cool
14:14 go|dfish: so you can cp that into your ~/bin/ i guess
14:14 go|dfish: and a+X it
14:14 go|dfish: whoops
14:14 go|dfish: a+x
14:15 go|dfish: you may need to change the shebang in it, for some reason the verion here has #!/pro/bin/perl
14:15 iaj: iaj(8268)::..1.64687/Text-CSV_XS-0.76/examples⤴  ./csv2xls
14:15 iaj: zsh: ./csv2xls: bad interpreter: /pro/bin/perl: no such file or directory
14:15 iaj: yeah
14:15 go|dfish: yeah
14:15 go|dfish: dunno what that is all about
14:15 iaj: haha
14:15 iaj: what do I have to change it to?
14:16 go|dfish: just
14:16 go|dfish: #!/usr/bin/perl
14:17 iaj: http://pastebin.com/EZD162Z3
14:18 go|dfish: ok, i do not get that error
14:18 go|dfish: ffs
14:18 iaj: usr/bin contained an old perl version it seems
14:18 iaj: i tried /opt/local/bin/perl now
14:18 iaj: which is 5.8.
14:18 go|dfish: ah
14:19 iaj: now Im getting...
14:19 iaj: http://pastebin.com/QkvzyM1K
14:19 iaj: lol
14:19 iaj: calc.pm missing.
14:19 go|dfish: hm dang
14:19 go|dfish: well
14:19 go|dfish: cpanm uses #!/usr/bin/env perl
14:19 go|dfish: so you can try that i guess
14:20 go|dfish: it may pick up one of the 2 you've just tried
14:21 iaj: i think i did the cpanm thing in a non eval'ed zsh shell
14:21 iaj: may that have caused the problem?
14:21 go|dfish: hmmm perhaps
14:21 iaj: e.g. a shell without that eval command.
14:21 iaj: but when I enter a new one and try to rerun
14:21 iaj: it says
14:22 iaj: both are up2date
14:22 go|dfish: hmm
14:22 iaj: do I maybe have to remove them and install again?
14:22 go|dfish: hold on one sec
14:22 iaj: thanks
14:23 go|dfish: try this in your shell
14:23 iaj: http://pastebin.com/jvkTtkhA
14:24 go|dfish: what does 
14:24 go|dfish: perl --version
14:24 go|dfish: say
14:24 go|dfish: in your shell?
14:24 iaj: v5.8.9 built for darwin-2level
14:24 go|dfish: 5.10.0 ?
14:24 go|dfish: what
14:24 go|dfish: hmm ok
14:24 go|dfish: what about, perl -MText::CSV_XS -e 1
14:24 iaj: seems like I macported it somewhat when
14:24 go|dfish: ah
14:25 iaj: Invalid module name Text:CSV_XS with -M option: contains single ':'.
14:25 go|dfish: hm ok
14:25 iaj: which perl is refering to /opt/local/bin
14:25 go|dfish: i guess zsh is messing with something ther
14:25 go|dfish: e
14:25 iaj: and I guess only macports are going there.
14:25 go|dfish: or not
14:25 go|dfish: perl -MText::CSV_XS -e 1
14:26 go|dfish: where is the single : going?
14:26 go|dfish: yeah i guess something related to the macports perl is messing with stuff, ffs
14:26 iaj: oh
14:26 iaj: i dropped a : there :(
14:27 iaj: when I hit the command with :: it says nothing.
14:27 iaj: should it act like that?
14:27 go|dfish: yeah, that means it's not erroring
14:27 go|dfish: ok try
14:27 go|dfish: in the same shell
14:27 go|dfish: perl /path/to/csv2xls
14:28 iaj: crying about not being able to locate Date/Calc.pm
14:28 iaj: same.
14:28 iaj: do I need Calc.pm somewhat?
14:29 iaj: do I need to install Date::Calc ?
14:29 go|dfish: hm yeah
14:29 go|dfish: try cpanm Date::Calc
14:29 go|dfish: i guess
14:29 go|dfish: that's pretty weird
14:29 iaj: installing.
14:29 iaj: :-)
14:29 iaj: it is.
14:29 go|dfish: i did get rid of all the macports stuff myself
14:30 go|dfish: so i'm not sure what the problem may be
14:30 iaj: strange.
14:30 go|dfish: something is getting mixed up anyways
14:30 iaj: iaj(8043)::~⤴  csv2xls /Users/iaj/Downloads/Export001-1.csv /Users/iaj/test.xls
14:30 iaj: # CSV_XS ERROR: 2032 - EIF - CR char inside unquoted, not part of EOL @ pos 259
14:30 iaj: 2032EIF - CR char inside unquoted, not part of EOL259 at /Users/iaj/bin/csv2xls line 132, <> line 1.
14:30 iaj: looking better :)
14:31 go|dfish: well it is running anwyays :)
14:31 iaj: well however that's a problem with csv2xls
14:31 go|dfish: it is
14:32 go|dfish: (as an offnote: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ was what i was recommended instead of macports, it is more up to date and stuff, you might want to check it out)
14:32 go|dfish: ok
14:32 iaj: oh
14:32 iaj: so I should use that one
14:32 iaj: ?
14:33 go|dfish: well, i replaced macports with it
14:33 go|dfish: i was having issues with vim and stuff from macports
14:33 iaj: does brew contain all the stuff that macports does?
14:34 go|dfish: hmm, i'm not sure on that one, it had all the stuff i used
14:34 go|dfish: urxvt, macvim, etc
14:34 iaj: heh ok.. im using vim from git anyway :-)
14:34 go|dfish: ah ok
14:35 go|dfish: that Text::CSV error
14:35 go|dfish: hm
14:35 go|dfish: does that .csv have windos line endings in it?
14:35 go|dfish: DOS, windows
14:35 iaj: sec... i could just try a .csv file where it has to work right?
14:35 go|dfish: yeah i guess that would be a good idea :)
14:35 iaj: eg abc;abc;abc  \r foo;foo;foo
14:36 go|dfish: and i could try locally
14:36 go|dfish: would also be a good idea
14:36 iaj: wooohooooo
14:37 iaj: its working :)
14:37 go|dfish: neato
14:37 iaj: so my file seems to be wrong in some place
14:37 iaj: cool man thanks for all your hlep
14:37 iaj: so your coding with perl
14:37 iaj: ?
14:37 go|dfish: not really
14:37 go|dfish: i have used it for some things though :)
14:37 iaj: i like :-))
14:38 iaj: what a luck to get pm'ed by you
14:38 iaj: who achieved a macbook pro just some time ago
14:38 go|dfish: haha yes :)
14:38 go|dfish: IRC can be very good for things like that sometimes
14:38 iaj: yeh... heh.. :-)
14:39 iaj: do you have any favorite apps for osx already?
14:39 go|dfish: well
14:39 go|dfish: i use QuickSilver
14:39 go|dfish: that is probably my favourite
14:39 iaj: heh.. same here :) which version do you use
14:39 iaj: the best fricken app of all time :D
14:39 iaj: did you place some triggers within?
14:39 go|dfish: i just changed the launcher to cmd + space
14:39 go|dfish: that's the only edit i did
14:40 iaj: using that one as well
14:40 iaj: really?
14:40 iaj: heh i boosted mine with a lot of triggers :D
14:40 go|dfish: yeah, i havent messed with it
14:40 iaj: too bad it isn't well supported anymore
14:40 go|dfish: i was going to just install linux on the macbook
14:40 go|dfish: but QS saved me
14:40 iaj: :-D
14:40 go|dfish: i used to use a tiling window manager
14:40 go|dfish: and do everything with keyboard
14:40 iaj: you bought a macbook and wanted to install linux on it?
14:40 go|dfish: um, i use iTerm too
14:40 iaj: that's strange heh
14:40 iaj: ITerm, yeah
14:40 iaj: you;r in irssi currenlty?
14:41 go|dfish: well i was annoyed getting used to OSX at the start
14:41 go|dfish: but now i'm ok with it
14:41 iaj: how do you use keyboard for everything now?
14:41 go|dfish: i use weechat for irssi
14:41 go|dfish: well
14:41 go|dfish: i use the Vimperator plugin for firefox
14:41 go|dfish: i still have to use the touchpad now and again
14:41 go|dfish: but it's not so bad
14:41 iaj: weechat :) heh..  yeh i was using vimp as well
14:41 iaj: just now switchted to pentadactyl because it got nicer ff4 support
14:41 go|dfish: oh nice
14:42 go|dfish: i shall check it out
14:42 go|dfish: i have spaces enabled
14:42 go|dfish: and apps pinned to certain spaces
14:42 iaj: you really should.
14:42 iaj: ohh.. alright :)
14:42 go|dfish: so they automatically switch when i start them up
14:42 iaj: that's a way of doing
14:42 iaj: but tiling ain't as easy on the osx book anymore eh?
14:42 go|dfish: yeah :)
14:42 go|dfish: there is a thing called ShiftUp
14:42 go|dfish: which you can moved windows with the keyboard
14:42 iaj: i use Quıcĸsıɩⅴεʀ β54 (3815) in order to have triggers, a shortcut for each application - don't use spaces at all
14:43 go|dfish: ah :)
14:43 go|dfish: i didn't read much on quicksilver
14:43 iaj: its worth it.
14:43 iaj: imo
14:43 iaj: a good timesaver :D
14:43 go|dfish: i will check it out, thanks
14:43 iaj: :-)
14:43 go|dfish: a handy app i did find was
14:43 go|dfish: The Unarchiver
14:43 iaj: i heard of that one as well... but I never use it because I tend to use the shell a lot
14:43 go|dfish: yeah
14:43 go|dfish: <3 shell!
14:44 iaj: what specifically is a good thing about it?
14:44 go|dfish: well just that it will handle any compressed file
14:44 go|dfish: zip, rar, etc
14:45 go|dfish: i used to like to have many terms, all tiled
14:45 go|dfish: but, it's not so bad i guess
14:45 iaj: heh... yeah im using screen...
14:45 iaj: which can tile as well.. even tho only once 
14:45 go|dfish: yeah
14:45 go|dfish: iterm with tabs is ok too
14:45 iaj: how much inches is your macbook?
14:46 iaj: ah right it does have tabs..
14:46 go|dfish: i got the 13.3 one
14:46 iaj: but for copying you need the mouse then
14:46 iaj: same here :)
14:46 iaj: got mine 2009 already tho
14:46 go|dfish: i used to really like having no borders, no decorations
14:46 go|dfish: and all of that
14:46 go|dfish: yeah, i got mine 2010
14:46 iaj: which tiling wm did you use?? xmonad, awesome, wii?
14:46 go|dfish: dwm
14:46 iaj: ahh.. that one.. never could give it a try
14:47 go|dfish: awesome is a fork of it
14:47 go|dfish: it was just really bare
14:47 go|dfish: but yeah, i used to slag the apple people jokingly
14:47 go|dfish: but i would buy another one 
14:47 go|dfish: you pay a few hundred more for the actual spec
14:48 iaj: hehe... if that machine will run fer another 2-3 years
14:48 iaj: im happy with it :)
14:48 go|dfish: but this thing never gets hot, and just the small things, like the magnetized charger port
14:48 iaj: had no problems with it at all.
14:48 go|dfish: \o/
14:48 iaj: battery is ok as well.
14:48 iaj: still ()
14:48 go|dfish: yeah, mine too
14:48 go|dfish: and it's always on
14:48 go|dfish: heh
14:48 iaj: heheh :-)) yup... almost never turn it off
14:49 iaj: im already thinking about what to get as my home pc
14:49 iaj: because I want to play StarCraft2
14:49 iaj: which that macbook ain't sufficient for, unfortunately
14:49 go|dfish: ah ye
14:49 go|dfish: s
14:49 go|dfish: well, i guess you could assemble a desktop
14:50 iaj: yeh but am I going to install on it...
14:50 iaj: won't go with windows :\
14:50 iaj: and unix with blizzard games is a mystery as well
14:50 go|dfish: ah ok :)
14:51 go|dfish: i'm not big into games no more, so it's ok for me
14:51 iaj: :-)
14:51 go|dfish: i only used to play Enemy Territory which this can handle
14:51 iaj: me neither - but .. those blizzard games are still enjoyable hheh
14:51 go|dfish: but nobody plays anymore
14:51 iaj: UFO that is?
14:51 go|dfish: hmm, i'm not sure
14:53 iaj: :-)
