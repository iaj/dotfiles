09:31  iaj: i just got the access to a new webpage... am I right that the basic dir.. the root dir of the site, is where .htaccess and index.html is stored?

10:39  joakimk: I have a <input type="text" name="username"> which does the auto-suggest thing when I type in it. However, if I have case sensitive usernames, this fails! If I type "JoakimK", it's automagically changed to "joakimk" every time since I've previously logged in as "joakimk"... How can I fix this, or disable auto-suggest for this text field?
