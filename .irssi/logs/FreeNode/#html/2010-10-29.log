01:51  aggrav8d: hello, all.
01:51  cardona507: howdy
01:53  aggrav8d: i need some advice.  i've been hired to create an api for people to add a plugin to their sites that will link to a hotel reservation system.  the plugin has fields like arrival date, departure date, # adults, and location, and clicking takes a user to the results page made to look like the client's website.  so far no problem, right?
01:54  aggrav8d: well location has me stumped.  they want a select for country that ajaxes a list of states/provinces that ajaxes a list of cities before the results are displayed.
01:55  aggrav8d: personally I'd like to put the search refining on the results page and say nuts to the ajax on the client's pages.
01:55  aggrav8d: what i'm wondering: is there a way to give them what they want without killing the server (via ajax ddosing)?
01:56  aggrav8d: the results by country will be too large to be useful, so everyone will need to refine their search.
01:57  ZombieLoffe: Uh. What's wrong with doing it the way suggested? YOu're concerned about server loda?
01:57  ZombieLoffe: load*
01:57  aggrav8d: yeah
01:58  ZombieLoffe: Should be fine... most users would only use 1 request to fetch countries, another to fetch regions
01:58  aggrav8d: maybe i'm worried about nothing.  i'd rather not have to make people redesign their plugins down the road, and I need to make this API straightforward.  "well set up all this js to make calls and then stick your input into these fields and cross your fingers" isn't much of an API.
02:03  aggrav8d: :T  I guess their js problems aren't MY js problems.
02:05  aggrav8d: thank you!
03:09  jhine: Newbish question but does it make any difference using ' over "?
03:12  Visage: jhine, Really doesn't make a difference, but in some instances, " is better and preferred.
03:12  jhine: Ok, thank you.
03:35  cmrn: jhine, I found after I started getting lazy and using ' everywhere, when I went back to using a stricter language I failed hard.
03:36  cmrn: (e.g 'a' is a char, "a" is a string)
03:36  cmrn: but for html, it rarely (never?) matters
03:36  CoJaBo: it can when using php
03:36  cmrn: that's why I said in HTML

15:57  onomi: hi
15:57  onomi: does somebody know anything like this in flash, for example? http://www.subirimagenes.com/imagen-component-5430264.html
16:08  riven: onomi: contrary to popular belief, this is not a Flash support channel.
16:09  jsumners: lol
16:09  onomi: i know
16:09  onomi: but there isnt a flash channel
16:09  Visage: Maybe there's a reason for that. :)
16:10  Visage: And actually there is a flash channel. ##flash
16:10  onomi: #flash           1     (invited only)
16:10  onomi: well.. anyway, do you know an html + jquery component to do that?
16:12  Visage: onomi, You're still asking in the wrong places.
16:12  Visage: ##flash for flash support, #jquery for jquery support.

20:07  riven: aggrav8d: I told iateadonut to go to #css for a reason, so let's not do that again. As for your question... guess what, in addition to not being #css, this channel also isn't ##php.
20:07  riven: -gasp-
20:08  aggrav8d: wow, you're all kinds of helpful.
20:08  riven: Directing you to the appropriate channel isn't helpful?
20:09  aggrav8d: not as much as just answering a question in a quiet channel.
20:09  aggrav8d: who actually has questions about html?  "how do i close a div tag?"  come on.
20:09  riven: Yes, that's exactly it. Now begone, troll.
20:13  aggrav8d: oh of course, great riven.  i'm sorry i busted up your little kingdom.
20:13  riven: Apology accepted. ;o
20:25  Visage: Ugh, typical nubs.
