00:44  ZombieLoffe: subform, not a url query string, as that sends a GET request... you need to POST the data. Can be done with 3rd party apps or addons.

01:48  cmrn: specifically, "HyperText Markup Language"
01:49  cmrn: xjkx, more info on markup languages: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language

11:17  kaseano: hi :) any1 know how to play an flv ? someone on here once told me to wrap it in a swf, not sure what that meant tho
11:21  cmrn: Step 1) Ask in an appropriate channel (PROTIP: not here)
11:21  cmrn: Step 2 - x) ?????
11:21  cmrn: Step x+1) Profit!
11:21  kaseano: embedding a flv in html isn't appropriate in #html?
11:22  cmrn: it's still a flash question
11:23  kaseano: thx for the lecture, "i dont know" would have been fine also
11:24  cmrn: > Implying I dont know
11:25  cmrn: Ok: Here's an answer as far as HTML is relevant: You cannot embed a FLV in HTML. You need an SWF wrapper. If you want to know how to do that, /join ##flash
11:27  kaseano: alright that's what I needed to know, thx, I'll go there.

15:25  Visage: `ask
15:25  rivvles: Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help. Just ask your question or state your problem and wait. Oh, and be sure to read the channel topic.
15:27  ion_shine: http://giv72.com/ how do I save this page so that I can modify the text?
15:27  ion_shine: the page saves as a huge hunk of code
15:27  ion_shine: probably machine generated
15:27  ion_shine: and the paragraph is liek a ton of lines eahc with gobidigook
15:27  ion_shine: is there a way to make a template
15:28  ion_shine: and then have liek a text file for the paragraph
15:28  ion_shine: also could the page be rewritten to somehow take % ages of screen real estet for each color, not sure hwoto handle the black borders in between color, but somehow reduce the code 98%
15:29  ion_shine: seem if the browser can be told ok red take 10% of left dide or something
15:29  ion_shine: it could be easier
15:29  ion_shine: I am quite new to html apologies
15:30  ion_shine: alternatievly
15:30  ion_shine: could I screen shot the pos
15:30  ion_shine: erase the text in middle
15:30  ion_shine: then make a pic of the screenshot into a background
15:30  ion_shine: and overlay text over that and link?
15:30  ion_shine: links-
15:36  CoJaBo: DYAC!!
15:36  Visage: ion_shine, I hope that's not your page, because that's some awful markup.
15:37  CoJaBo: Egads, ew.
15:37  Visage: ion_shine, Also, stick to one question at a time please. :) You are also asking some very non-HTML things.
15:37  Visage: And with that,

15:37  Visage: CoJaBo, DID I SAY YOU COULD TALK? NO! STFU. :)
15:38  Visage: Here I was, about to have a very non-fail morning, then CoJaBo started talking and ruined it.
15:38  CoJaBo: Oh, I had epic fails driving thiss moontang
15:38  CoJaBo: mornign
15:38  Visage: And typing.
15:39  kaseano: hi, I did some stuff to boost my SEO on google and I guess they caught it & blacklisted my urls, any1 know how to get google to un-blacklist from their SE :)
15:39  Visage: kaseano, Ask google.
15:39  CoJaBo: Visage: Oh, I had a Astronomical Swype Fail like, just 2 minutes ago too. -_-'
15:39  Visage: That is also not an HTML question.
15:39  Visage: CoJaBo, I know.
15:41  CoJaBo: Visage: I told i girl I'd be able to make it afterall (to work on some stupid project). It put it "make out". FML.
15:41  ion_shine: ok to make such a background design by hand is possible?
15:41  ion_shine: I know by hand would be less code.
15:42  CoJaBo: ion_shine: #CSS for layout questions
15:43  riven: CoJaBo: cool story, bro
15:44  CoJaBo: This will hopefully not be.. awkward.
15:44  Visage: CoJaBo is always full of stories. He's about as on-topic as meta is.
15:44  CoJaBo: lol
15:44  riven: At least Meta's name is on-topic...
15:44  Visage: riven, True.
15:44  Visage: Even though she is mostly useless. :)
15:45  riven: haha :)
15:45  Visage: Yeah, I went there.
15:46  kaseano: Visage wow there's a #google room nvm sry :)
15:46  Visage: kaseano, Indeed, but I don't think they're going to be much help.
15:46  riven: They should rename /list /google
15:46  CoJaBo: lol
15:46  CoJaBo: Theeres #web too, might be relevant
15:47  Visage: Your face is less relevant.
15:47  riven: ^
15:47  Sefyroth: Much like your mother.
15:47  Visage: That too.

15:50  CoJaBo: ?
15:50  riven: lol, apparently he doesn't. And neither do I ><
15:54  Visage: riven, I was gonna say you're like butter because you're always on a roll.
15:55  Visage: But I said that one already.
15:55  riven: lal
15:58  CoJaBo: I've.. actually never heard that one before.. lol
15:58 * CoJaBo steals
15:59  Visage: CoJaBo, But you're never on a roll, unless it's a ROLL OF FAIL.
15:59  riven: ^
15:59  CoJaBo: I sat on a roll once.
15:59  CoJaBo: Thanksgiving.
16:00  CoJaBo: Literal fail. xD
16:00  CoJaBo: now /me is on a roll :P

16:11  ZombieLoffe: you also need to find a more appropriate channel
16:12  ZombieLoffe: We don't take kindly to your kind [of talk] around here
16:13  Visage: Heh.
16:13  ZombieLoffe: #mysql is like.. out back or whatever?
16:14  ZombieLoffe: Someone needs to draw schematics over this network, I'm getting all confused.
16:16  Visage: Actually the basement is where we keep all the REALLY EVIL shit locked away, like #flash.
16:17  Visage: Er, ##flash. My bad.

17:57  w3bg33k: is there a way to setup a google map in an iframe anymore?  the last time i did one, they gave you the iframe code...any suggestions or tutorials anyone can point out?
18:01  Pilum: Iframes are bad (tm)
18:09  eighty4: w3bg33k: uhm... google it?
18:09  eighty4: Pilum: also, sometimes you must use iframes
18:09  Pilum: Must? No.
18:09  Visage: eighty4, Sometimes you must stick your hand in a band saw... Oh wait...
18:09  w3bg33k: i did google it, but everything refers to examples using javascript, and i can't mess w/ the headers
18:09  eighty4: if you want a service, yes
18:09  Pilum: So? You don't have to mess with the headers for JS.
18:10  Pilum: A service? Heh.
18:10  Pilum: Do try to hide your ignorance better.
18:10  eighty4: "service" might be a bad choice of word
18:10  Visage: How duz I service?
18:11  Hajuu: I wanna make a little tool for coding php on devices without a keyboard
18:11  eighty4: Currently have to do iframes for a facebook campaign for example
18:11  Hajuu: maybe like a big self constructing form using dropdown boxes
18:11  Hajuu: doesnt seem very usable like that though
18:12  Visage: Just use one of those devices that lets you think shit and it happens.
18:12  Visage: Wait, that could be bad. Nevermind.
18:13  eighty4: Pilum: or how would you suggest a facebook framed app without an iframe?
18:13  Pilum: I would suggest not using facebook.
18:14  Pilum: But if I had to do something facebook then yes, I'd find a way to solve it without iframes.
18:15  eighty4: Pilum: if you want an "in facebook" app it's kind of not an option
18:16  Visage: Who makes facebook apps anyway? Srsly.
18:16  eighty4: Me, currently
18:16  Visage: You suck. :)
18:16  eighty4: and my options is a. do the work or b. don't get paid
18:17  eighty4: and yes, you can do facebook apps without iframes but that way you don't get it frames in the same way
18:18  Pilum: So?
18:18  Pilum: I'm sure it'd be possible anyway. It's just a matter of finding out how.
18:21  eighty4: Pilum: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/ you have two options. Use an iframe or don't frame it
18:23  Pilum: Then don't frame it. Win.
18:24  eighty4: Pilum: again... my options: a. do the work or b. don't get paid
18:24  Pilum: There's a big difference between "not possible" and "can't be bothered"
18:24  Pilum: And I've never commented on *your* situation.
18:25  eighty4: Pilum: and sure, not getting paid is an option. But that would make me loose my apartment, don't be able to buy food, don't... and so on
18:25  Pilum: I really couldn't care less.
18:25  Pilum: All I've disagreed with is that you *
18:25  Pilum: *MUST* use iframes. You don't.
18:26  eighty4: yeah know sure... when it comes to it you don't have to breath either.
18:26  eighty4: you're absolutely right
18:26  Pilum: Your analogy sucks.
18:26  riven: PROOVE IT
18:26  riven: Also, prove.
18:27  eighty4: If you want to create a facebook app framed in facebook you have to use an iframe. But sure, if you don't have that you don't need an iframe
18:28  riven: ...
18:28  riven: eighty4: that analogy sucks even more.
18:28  Pilum: "If you want to create something in an iframe then you need to use an iframe." Sure.
18:28  eighty4: riven: it does. I begun with "sometimes you must use iframes"
18:28  Pilum: Again, that's down to *want* not *must*
18:28  eighty4: if you want a and be you need to do c
18:29  riven: see* :)
18:29 * Pilum would be much happier to create a facebook app without iframes, and is sure he could convince his employer (if he'd even let him know).
18:30 * eighty4 _have_ convinced many customers to do it without iframes
18:30  eighty4: but for this particular "campaign" it makes a lot more sense to frame it
18:31  Pilum: You appear to have been arguing against something completely different than my statement. :-)
18:31  Pilum: As long as there's choise there's no "must" :-)
18:32 * Pilum pulls out his Grammar Nazi badge.
18:34  Visage: Did someone say Grammar Nazi?
18:34  riven: Reporting for duty!
