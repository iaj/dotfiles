00:01  zack88: how can i find a link to a redirected resource?
00:01  zack88: direct link i mean... is it always possible?
00:02  Visage: Huh?
00:03  zack88: on google sites, hosted files only provide redirected links and not the original one
00:04  zack88: i must discover the direct link in order to embed the css stylesheet on my site

00:17  Visage: Wow.
00:17  Visage: Easy: delete, start over, write correctly this time. :)
00:17  Visage: And with the correct doctype as well. Heh.
00:23  cardona507: 4294 errors and 374 warnings! wtf?
00:24  Visage: It's a new record. :)
00:25  cardona507: for sure :)
00:26  cardona507: what was it? the google homepage? ZING
00:39  mikemonk: hi guys, which would be a good book/material to learn web development?
00:39  Visage: `schools
00:39  rivvles: Explore the intricacies of HTML and CSS here: http://wsc.opera.com/, www.htmlhelp.com/, http://css-discuss.incutio.com/, www.brainjar.com/, www.htmldog.com/, http://css.maxdesign.com.au/
00:39  Visage: mikemonk, ^^ Those.
00:40  ZombieLoffe: ANd whatever you do, stay away from w3schools.
00:41  Visage: `w3schools
00:41  rivvles: W3Schools == Errors, omissions, deceit.  Stop reading/pointing to them! Syntax Errors in the example -> http://xrl.us/bfxwd | Complete bullshit -> http://xrl.us/bfxwf | Totally wrong -> http://xrl.us/bh7cag http://xrl.us/bh7cap
00:41  Visage: Because, yeah. :)
00:43  ZombieLoffe: b-cuz shit b trippin 4rlz
00:43  mikemonk: ok i'll stay away from w3schools
00:43  Visage: Because web design is srs bsns.
00:44  mikemonk: recommended books? or everything i need is on the sites rivvles kindly shared with me?
00:45  Visage: mikemonk, We don't recommend book, because books are often outdated and mostly wrong.
00:45  Visage: And, you know, sites are free and more updated and stuff. :)
00:45  mikemonk: i see :)
00:45  mikemonk: any more sites you guys can think of?
00:45  Visage: mikemonk, I recommend starting with Opera's WSC though. It's quite good.
00:46  ZombieLoffe: http://www.diveintohtml5.org for a great intro to HTML5, if that tickles your fancy.
00:46  mikemonk: ok that's a good advice Visage, thanks
00:47  mikemonk: ZombieLoffe: i want to be able to build useful, innovative, and beautiful web apps, would you say guys, html5 is a requirement?
00:48  Visage: mikemonk, Seems to be the way the web is headed, so you may as well learn it. :)
00:50  mikemonk: Visage, ok
00:51  mikemonk: any particular order for learning the technologies involved?
00:51  Visage: mikemonk, Gotta learn the basics first, so that means you should be able to write HTML and CSS in your sleep before moving on.
00:51  Visage: After that, some server-side language, database backend, and some JS to top it all off.
00:52  Visage: Mix well. :)
00:52  mikemonk: by server-side language you mean php, ruby on rails, or django right?
00:52  cardona507: and serve chilled
00:52  cardona507: node.js ftw
00:52  Visage: mikemonk, php, perl, python, ruby, asp, etc.
00:52  Visage: Pick your poison there.
00:53  mikemonk: Visage, which one would you recommend?
00:53  Visage: mikemonk, I recommend the one that is easiest for you to learn, whatever that may be.
00:53  Visage: Do some research into them and see which one you can pick up the fastest.
00:53  mikemonk: i already know to program in java and c++
00:53  Visage: In the end, you'll still get a site, doesn't matter how you get there. :)
00:54  GarethAdams|Home: mikemonk: most of the popular web languages are dynamically typed, interpreted languages, so you're likely going to have to learn new stuff either way
00:55  mikemonk: GarethAdams|Home, ok
00:55  mikemonk: Visage, what are the options for the database backend? which would you recommend?
00:56  Visage: mikemonk, mysql seems to be quite popular there, but once again, you'll get mixed opinions.
00:56  Visage: DB systems really aren't that much of an issue these days, since we have ORMs and abstraction.
00:57  mikemonk: Visage, ok
00:57  mikemonk: well... thanks everybody for the roadmap :)
00:58  mikemonk: i'll shall start to study as soon as i have some free time
00:58  Visage: Excellent.
00:58  Visage: Good luck. :)
00:58  mikemonk: Visage, thanks :)
00:58  mikemonk: see you later guys
01:00  DerpinLlama: mikemonk?
01:00  DerpinLlama: damn, small world >.<

10:59  iaj: hi there :)
11:00  iaj: can anyone guide me to where I can find to have an href linking to a file.. but instead of opening the file to show the download file dialog?
11:15  riven: iaj: you'll want to ask that in #yourserversidelanguageofchoicehere
11:15  riven: (you need to set appropriate HTTP headers)
11:16  AdvoWork: anyone here recommend the best way to embed pdf's into a website, without converting to flash?
11:17  iaj: riven: so, that would be php for example?
11:17  riven: AdvoWork: ... <a href="foo.pdf">ZOMG I CAN HAZ PDF</a>
11:17  riven: easy, no?
11:17  riven: iaj: sure
11:33  AdvoWork: riven, will that only work with say adobe?
11:33  riven: what?
11:33  AdvoWork: riven, n i want to be able to see it in the page, not for them to download it
11:33  AdvoWork: if you get me
11:33  AdvoWork: ie <div id="pdfdiv">SHOW PDF HERE </div>
11:33  riven: AdvoWork: that's up to the user. If they have their browser configured to open it in the browser with an appropriate plugin, it will.
11:36  AdvoWork: hmm, that won't serve the purpose then I dont think, it *has* to embed in the webpage or not atall
11:36  ormaaj: Confusingly, old IE guesses that any *.html is html based upon it's extension too.
11:37  riven: AdvoWork: no it doesn't have to.
11:37  riven: Don't be silly.
11:37  AdvoWork: riven, yes it does. you have no idea what im trying to do. for the purpose of this task, it does need to embed directly into the page otherwise the idea is pointless.
11:37  riven: No it doesn't. You're wrong. Go away.
11:39  goathird: riven: he was trying to be silly.
11:40  AdvoWork: riven, if the pdf won't always embed in the actual page, and they *may* be presented with a pdf to download. They may as well have the pdf to download in the first place, rather than constructing a page to show embedded pdfs
11:41  ormaaj: web browser != pdf viewer.
11:42  ormaaj: That's why google has to use their special parser to transform PDF/postscript into HTML to be viewable in their PDF preview links.
11:46  riven: AdvoWork: okay, let me make this super-clear for you: you cannot assume that the user has their browser setup to view pdfs "inline". Period.
11:48  AdvoWork: riven, i know, i understand that, but to serve this purpose, if i can't assume that, i may have to change the design.  ormaaj  do you know if theres an api available for that?  this is for sort of approval of works, there could be 1 or multiple pdfs(dynamically generated) that need viewing. in the page if possible(well more of a must). Unsure how else to do it?
11:48  psycho23: What if I have a web developer that doesn't respond to emails until 5 business days later, what should I do?
11:49  riven: Fire him, obviously? :)
11:50  psycho23: maybe I should change the contract?  Require at most 5 days?  maybe temporarily disable him and find another web developer in the mean time where the requirement is clear?
11:50  psycho23: I think the contract would be to respond to emails in at most 3 days
11:50  riven: 3? Jeez.
11:50  oksushi: psycho23: sounds like the lack of response is a symptom of a greater issue that no amount of legalese will fix
11:50  riven: More like 3 hours.
11:50  oksushi: i.e. get a better web developer
11:51  riven: Also, email is sooooooo 199x, lrn2use voice comms. :)
11:51  oksushi: hah
11:52  psycho23: but text can be more verbose and morely proofread, right?
11:54  ormaaj: AdvoWork: The correct method would be (similarly to iaj's above question) to specify the content type of the data you're delivering in the headers, and if a user agent claims to support it in it's accept headers, then it will be downloaded and displayed in the appropriate UA if found. What you're essentially asking is: "Why can't my browser / magical universal data presentation program take my arbitrary data formats and transparently understand how
11:54  ormaaj:  to display them in a div?"
11:55  ormaaj: AdvoWork: I seem to recall reading something about a google API for that (part of google docs I think)... search for it.
11:57  ormaaj: There's probably a java applet pdf viewer or other such ugly way of sticking it into an <object>
11:59  ormaaj: heh... I guess there are even pure javascript implementations.
12:00  ormaaj: AdvoWork: https://docs.google.com/viewer?pli=1
13:50  ElGoorf: before i go ahead and base a whole project on this idea, is there any reason why using "/" in an anchor name is a bad idea?
13:52  riven: "anchor name"?
13:54  ElGoorf: where you have "#" in the link
13:54  ElGoorf: for example:   ...<a href="#travels/japan">...
13:55  riven: that's fine
13:55  ElGoorf: I mean, i always assumed it would just break something, looking for a file named japan in #travels or something
13:56  ElGoorf: but i just tested it and it worked, but just wanted to make sure there wasnt something i was overlooking
13:56  riven: ElGoorf: it should be noted though, that the resulting id="travels/japan" is an invalid id name in HTML4.
13:57  ElGoorf: you mean name="travels/japan" right?
13:57  riven: It is valid in HTML5, and will work fine regardless of validation.
13:57  riven: ElGoorf: no, that use is obsolete.
13:58  ElGoorf: really? :O
13:58  ElGoorf: what hole have i been living in?
13:58  riven: and has been for, oh, 13 years or so
14:00  ElGoorf: and it worked for id of any element... wow how did i miss this :S
14:01  ElGoorf: guess i just never use #'s enough :S
14:01  ElGoorf: anyway thanks for the help
14:02  riven: np
14:24  crackguy: is there any free online shopping website making library
14:26  riven: crackguy: lrn2google. Either way, off-topic here.
15:02  KucukMubasir: why does my browser send a request for checking the expire date of every resource, when I refresh the page; but not when I re-type the name of the site to address bar and enter?
15:03  riven: Surely that's not an HTML question; try #web.
15:04  KucukMubasir: thanks riven
15:46  Itrace: This is weird: when I view my site on an iPhone it's zoomed in. How can I have it so my whole site is visible when it's loaded?
15:50  Teratogen: maybe you need to give it a .mobi
15:51  Itrace: I found it. I had the mobile viewport meta tag in my header when I didn't need it. (i.e. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">)
17:13  iaj: is there any way to have a radio button on a webpage to be disabled after selecting something?
17:15  Visage: iaj, Without reloading the page? Javascript.
17:20  iaj: Visage: do you have an example for that one?
17:20  stillRise: I have a series of <div> [created by an outside organization].  Now I'm adding a new div that is sort acts like a column with pictures in it.  My design looks great in FF but in IE it actully pushes the entire content by the height of my introduced width.  Any assistance would be appreciated
17:20  Visage: iaj, ##javascript might.
17:21  Visage: stillRise, #css for presentational issues.
17:21  stillRise: ok, thanks
17:21  iaj: Visage: heh thanks i already tried but it's invite only unfort.:(
17:22  Visage: iaj, No it isn't. :) Are you registered and identified?
17:22  Visage: And did you use two ##s?
17:22  Visage: ##javascript, not #javascript.
18:02  iaj: thanks
18:02  iaj: worked :)
18:05  Polochon_street: Hello!
18:06  Polochon_street: Is that code wrong?
18:06  Polochon_street: http://pastebin.com/P6Cvp3yV
18:07  Polochon_street: Because the video won't display on firefox on linux, but on Windows it does
18:07  Polochon_street: Can anoyone help me?
18:08  Visage: Polochon_street, It's wrong in the sense that you don't need XHTML and you're serving it improperly.
18:08  Polochon_street: So what must I do?
18:09  Visage: Well, regarding the video, you need to have the proper plugin installed to play that.
18:09  Polochon_street: I precise that the audio ogg launches on that site (http://joliclic.free.fr/html/object-tag/object-audio.html#note1)
18:09  Polochon_street: Firefox decode natively ogg
18:10  Visage: So most likely, firefox on linux for you doesn't know how to play that type.
18:10  Visage: And do you have an actual url? Because I also use firefox on linux.
18:10  Polochon_street: http://joliclic.free.fr/html/object-tag/object-audio.html#note1
18:10  Polochon_street: This
18:11  Visage: I see no .ogv there.
18:12  Polochon_street: Oh, it's ogg, sorry ><
18:12  Polochon_street: In fact, I can see every ogv videos on my firefox
18:12  Polochon_street: Wikimedia commons works
18:12  Polochon_street: Like this http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:F-35_Lightning_II_video.ogv
18:12  Polochon_street: Just mine don't works
18:13  Visage: They're using HTML 5's <video> on that page, not <object>.
18:14  Polochon_street: Oh
18:14  Visage: Firefox supports ogg/theora natively with HTML 5 video.
18:14  Polochon_street: ...
18:14  Visage: With <object>, you need a plugin installed to handle that mimetype, which you obviously don't. :)
18:14  Polochon_street: :/
18:15  Visage: The quick fix: use HTML 5 <video>.
18:15  Visage: And provide sources for other formats that other browsers can handle (not every major browser likes ogv.)
18:17  Polochon_street: The "video" tag works
18:17  Polochon_street: Thanks!
18:18  Visage: :)
18:19  Visage: Just make sure you switch your doctype to HTML 5.
