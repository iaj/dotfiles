13:09  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010, greasemonkey might allow you to do something like that.
13:09  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010, never rely on only JS for validation, always have server-side validation on top of the client-side valdiation

14:09  krz: input:focus targets all input elements. what if i want to target all input elements except of type="image" or type submit ?
14:10  Sefyroth: krz: #css would know. But IIRC, it's input[type!='image']:focus or something.
14:10  krz: its quiet in #css
14:14  Visage: krz, No excuse to bug off-topic channels.
14:14  krz: Visage: still html related!
14:15  krz: its not an excuse
14:15  krz: fyi
14:15  Visage: Thanks, but I know how to run the channel.
14:15  Visage: Now go wait in #css and have patience.

15:53  Woutifier: Hm. How, in a table, can each tr have it's own height. Instead of all the tr's having the height of the one with the highest height.
15:54  Woutifier: if that makes any sense
15:56  potatodemon: I have a table that needs to have 3 levels of heading, does anyone have an examles of a beautiful complex table design ?
15:58  paideia: hi, is there a way of making all the images (but just the images) centered in a html file? something like a global setting. (I know nothing about html... just trying to hack something for my needs)
16:01  Pilum: You do that with CSS.
16:01  ZombieLoffe: Woutifier: it doesn't
16:01  Pilum: Which is discussed in #css.
16:25  Woutifier: ZombieLoffe: so there's no way to do that?
16:56  aro: is there a pastebin that will let you preview how html will look
16:57  Hajuu: no way dude
16:57  Hajuu: thats like
16:57  Hajuu: impossible
16:58  Visage: nou
16:58  Visage: http://www.webdevout.net/test, but it appears to be down for me.
17:02  ZombieLoffe: `paste @ aro
17:02  rivvles: aro, Live pastebins: http://www.webdevout.net/test, http://www.jsfiddle.net/, http://pastehtml.com/
17:02  ZombieLoffe: webdevout.net seems to be wonky today.

17:13  kaseano: I have to embed a wmv and avi into my view, the only way I could come up with to avoid plugins was converting the flash
17:13  kaseano: is there a better way
17:14  ZombieLoffe: there's <video> in html5, but fairly poorly supported (no IE < 9)
17:15  ZombieLoffe: Converting to flash video and embedding with an .swf is still the safest alternative.
17:15  Aristata: Hey if I have a meta tag for keywords, should I make one keyword "Discount Real Estate Brokerage" or four "discount", "real", "estate", "brokerage"
17:16  ZombieLoffe: Aristata: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#h-B.4
17:17  ZombieLoffe: Dunno how valuable that info is, though. AFAIK most SE crawlers don't care a lot about keywords because people abuse them.
17:17  kaseano: oh ok thx ZombieLoffe
17:18  kaseano: I was thinking about putting it on youtube then embedding that youtube file cus I know that works, prob easier converting straight to flash tho
17:18  kaseano: embedding the youtube url
17:18  kaseano: *
17:18  ZombieLoffe: Honestly, uploading it to youtube is probably the fastest.
17:18  ZombieLoffe: But either way works.
17:18  kaseano: ok thx :)
17:20  kaseano: ZombieLoffe: do you know if I convert to .swf will have that control bar or just play w.o controls like a gif
17:20  kaseano: will it*
17:21  ZombieLoffe: you convert it to .flv then use a .swf container for the searchbar and stuff.
17:21  kaseano: OH
17:21  kaseano: :)
17:21  kaseano: thx

17:55  Articate: can I force a full reload of a page on load?
17:56  Articate: I've made a system that sets stuff in a database and my overview page doesn't reflect the changes unless I do ctrl+f5, so I'm thinking it's cached and isn't told to update on load
17:56  Articate: ..actually, it's just a delay in the system, it seems, never mind :D
17:57  Visage: And that wouldn't be an HTML issue anyway. :)

18:07  sharkhat: hey guys, is there a way to set expire times on images for cache?
18:07  sharkhat: internet exploerer is giving me grief
18:09  Visage: sharkhat, If you could, it certainly wouldn't be with HTML. :)
18:13  sharkhat: really?
18:13  sharkhat: i thought there was "<META HTTP-EQUIV="CACHE-CONTROL" CONTENT="NO-CACHE">" and things like that
18:13 --- bekabug is now known as bekabook
18:13  sharkhat: <META HTTP-EQUIV="EXPIRES"
18:13  sharkhat: CONTENT="Mon, 22 Jul 2002 11:12:01 GMT"> i wanted something like this, but not date, a time to live
18:14  sharkhat: so i dont have to change code everytime a change an image.
18:14  Visage: Those things should be sent as headers, not http-equiv.
18:14  Visage: Use a server-side language to do that instead.
18:16  sharkhat: ah yes, i see
18:16  sharkhat: is there a google hosted javascript to do that i wonder
18:17  sharkhat: also, i am trying to find the speed hangups in our webpage, what is a good analyser ?
18:17  sharkhat: that breaks down the loading of parts and suggests speedups
18:27  Articate: is it possible to send any value for a checked checkbox to POST?

21:31  BluePeppers: Say I have a div, inside which I have another div, which wraps an img. The outermost div has style="opacity: 0.8". Is there any way I can have the img be completely opaque? Setting "opacity:1" on the img at the moment does nothing, as it seems to be calculated relative to the opacity of the parent.
21:32  oksushi: BluePeppers: #css for css questions
21:32  BluePeppers: oksushi, will do, thanks
