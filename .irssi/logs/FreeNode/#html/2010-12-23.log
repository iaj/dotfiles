00:00  nikitis: Hello, I can't seem to figure out how to make a text alt show up when hovering over an image if it's not a hyperlink.  Is there a way to do this without java?
00:02  CoJaBo: nikitis: Title attribute. Not alt, thats an IE bug.
00:02  Visage: nikitis, alt attributes don't show up on hover anyway. You want the title attribute.
00:02  Visage: Yeah, IE is silly, like CoJaBo here.
00:02 * CoJaBo puts on a funny hag
00:02  CoJaBo: hat
00:02 * CoJaBo facepams
00:03  nikitis: I agree IE is silly.  I'm an oldschool web designer from like Pre-1995.  Just started getting back into it
00:04  nikitis: So my terminology may be a bit antiquated
00:04  nikitis: I've started using CSS and divs vs oldschool tables
00:04  CoJaBo: Might want to learn CSS and all the latest Hot New Stuff then :P
00:05  nikitis: Got that down, It's just little things like alt, and etc that are tripping me up
00:06  nikitis: I still use Frames though.  Don't like having to load my title picture for every page.
00:06  nikitis: Plus my users all have huge monitors
00:06  CoJaBo: Yeh, frames are out too these days-
00:07  CoJaBo: Things like PHP includes, etc can use to have common menus, etc.

00:08  CoJaBo: nikitis: Also, avoid w3schools.com. They suck, they dont fis there errrs.
00:09  CoJaBo: *fix their errors
00:09  nikitis: where is good to validate?
00:09  CoJaBo: ]validate
00:09  _ZofBot4: You can validate your website at http://validator.w3.org or by saying in this channel: '@WEBSITE' i.e. @http://www.google.com
00:10  CoJaBo: The bot knows all. =D
00:10  nikitis: Frames work good for me so I can hijack a couple of pages.
00:10  nikitis: Can you use php includes to hijack?
00:10  CoJaBo: Hijack?
00:10  Visage: Wut
00:10  nikitis: Yeah, like view google results inside of my page, etc.
00:11  Visage: Uh, you know google provides an API, right?
00:11  nikitis: Test it out at http://wetnet.in
00:11  nikitis: that's my page
00:11  nikitis: It's a World of warcraft guild page
00:12  Visage: Yeah, ditch the frames.
00:12  nikitis: Have a good reason?
00:12  CoJaBo: lol.. its completely unscroll able xD
00:12  Visage: This ain't 1999 anymore, for one.
00:13  nikitis: How can one use google and still have the menu on the side?
00:13  nikitis: without frames?
00:13  CoJaBo:  just link to google.
00:13  Visage: nikitis, By learning to use the API and your favorite server-side language.
00:13  Visage: There is hardly ever a good reasont to use frames anymore.
00:14  CoJaBo: or use their api or custom branded search engine
00:14  nikitis: I'd suppose I'd have to learn php or something
00:14  nikitis: which I don't know
00:14  Visage: Well, no time like the present to start learning.
00:15  nikitis: CoJaBo, what is unscrollable?
00:15  CoJaBo: user s these days know how to return to your site- you can simply link to other sites these days without fear habakkuk get lost.
00:15  neiz: nikitis: php, for includes, is simple: http://www.tizag.com/phpT/include.php and very very helpful in every aspect of site building
00:16  CoJaBo: nikitis: i cannot scroll beyond the top left corner on framed sites.
00:16  CoJaBo: nor can anyone else on a mobile device.. lol
00:17  nikitis: hmm your right about mobile
00:17  nikitis: Just tried it on my Droid
00:18  nikitis: wonder why?  I can in crhome and other browsers
00:18 * CoJaBo is on a droid x =D
00:18  CoJaBo: mobile bruisers don't support frames
00:18  CoJaBo: browser s
00:19  CoJaBo: you can't scroll multiple documents on a touch screen lol
00:19  CoJaBo: especially a furry one
00:19  CoJaBo: tinny one

00:29  Visage: CoJaBo, You just keep failing tonight, huh? :)
00:30  CoJaBo: oh this day was a MASS give FAIL.
00:30  nikitis: Okay, on the introduction, maybe half of those reasons are true as to why frames are bad.  If done right.
00:30  CoJaBo: MASSIVE*
00:31  nikitis: [back] buttons work fine in frames if done correctly
00:31  nikitis: Page up and down work flawlessly
00:31  nikitis: Getting trapped in Framesets don't happen if coded correctly
00:32  Pilum: "Genocide isn't so bad if done correctly."
00:32  CoJaBo: you still can't scroll. and it badly breaks seek engines.
00:32  Visage: Pilum++
00:32  nikitis: i can scroll on a desktop
00:32  nikitis: i've locked scrolling on a couple of frames
00:32  CoJaBo: Pilum+++
00:32  nikitis: cause it looks terrible otherwise, but webkit apparently kills the scrolling which is bad
00:33  nikitis: I'm agreeing that i need to change frames
00:33  nikitis: I'm just saying it's not as bad as these people are claiming
00:33  Visage: nikitis, Yes, yes it is.
00:34  CoJaBo:  yeh, they exaggerate the little issues- but the big issues are still valid.
00:34  nikitis: Would I be able to view other sites in a frame using xframes?
00:35  nikitis: Some search sites like wowhead won't allow for search results like google do
00:36  CoJaBo: just link to them.no need to frame.
00:36  Visage: Then they fail. Tell them to create a search API to use.
00:37  nikitis: They do fail, but because they do, I have to as well.....  Cause i need the functionality to stay within my portal.  The ability to switch directly from forum post to wowhead search results is what makes my site powerful.
00:37  nikitis: and useful to my users
00:37  nikitis: But if I could figure out a way to show only the results
00:38  nikitis: I could change all of that
00:52  nikitis: Okay, with xframes, I'm confused on the id part.  I'm reading it, but it's not clear to me.
00:54  nikitis: I guess I don't understand the concept of a URI
00:57  nikitis: How does a frame ID access a URI?
00:57  nikitis: are URI's files which link the ID's with the data?
00:58  riven: URIs*, IDs*
00:58  nikitis: I'm confused how URI's work.  I know they contain references to the ID.  But are they files?  or meta data stored in the .xhtml file?
00:59  riven: URIs*
00:59  nikitis: ...... So confused
01:00  nikitis: Example
01:01  nikitis: I do a <frame id="menu"/>  Now i'm supposed to have that menu associated to the menu.html file.  I'm told this happens via URI.  An example is shown site.xfm#frames(menu=menu.xhtml)
01:02  nikitis: Where is the URI #frames(menu=menu.xhtml) stored?
01:03  nikitis: cause if your telling me i have to type http://site.com/menu.frm#frames(menu=menu.xhtml) every time I want to visite the site, then XFrames is not the way to go
01:06  CoJaBo:  are x frames even supported by any thong yet?
01:06  nikitis: xhtml2
01:07  Visage: XHTML2 is dead.
01:07  Visage: It does not exist.
01:07  nikitis: Then are you telling me not to use xframes?
01:08  Visage: I'm telling you that you need to redesign your site from scratch.
01:08  Visage: You've been out of the game too long.

01:46  nikitis: One last question.  On my page I use a title picture that scrolls from one picture to another using some javascript.  reloading my page would reset the picture it's using back to the first picture.  As part of my rules for quality, this cannot happen.  I can do this with frames, but is this possible to do with CSS?  I can't have that section reloaded everytime someone clicks.  I want to do the right thing and not use frames.
01:52  nikitis: Is there a way to change the body area of a web page without having to reload the menu's and title?  And I'm not talking about reloading the menu, and having it look the exact same on the new page.

06:13  merma: any idea how can I do this: I want to choose an icon, currently I have a radiobutton left to each icon to select it, but I want to change it to just have the icons and when I click one it highlights, is there an easy way to do this or something similar?
06:31  ccd: Can I make a page add a GET to it's own URL? I have URL's that are hash values, and to make them a bit more friendly, I want to stick a GET on the end... not to actually use the GET for anything...
06:32  ccd: but I dont want to actually need to have the GET in the link to the page to have the GET show up when the user reaches the page
06:32  richardwhiuk: ccd: iframe?
06:32  richardwhiuk: merma: normally that's done using javascript to control a hidden underlying radiobutton aiui
06:35  ccd: richardwhiuk: trying to understand... so make a <iframe src ="myhashpagename?friendly_get_request" width="100%" that loads ?
06:35  richardwhiuk: oh right, sorry I misunderstood what you wanted to do
06:36  richardwhiuk: you have 694abc and you want it to appear as 694abc?a_really_important_page_title
06:36  richardwhiuk: ?
06:36  ccd: yes
06:36  ccd: without needing to link to it with the get int he link
06:37  richardwhiuk: if so, then do a 302 redirect at the server side to the page with the query string
06:37  richardwhiuk: (you can use 301 if your page titles never change)
06:37  ccd: ok. so you see no way to do it "in place"... even with js?... I ask because I am doing in the context of mediawiki
06:37  richardwhiuk: however this will be very bad for performance as you will double the number of requests you have to perform
06:38  richardwhiuk: ccd: no - any call to change the query string does a refresh
06:38  ccd: security security... I figured that would be the case
06:38  ccd: ok understandable
06:38  richardwhiuk: what you can do is have 694abc#My_Page_Title - but that intereferes with headings and suchlike
06:38  ccd: aah... so I dont need a GET!?
06:38  richardwhiuk: no
06:39  richardwhiuk: but that has a different side affect
06:39  richardwhiuk: which is that it causes an extra step in the browser history
06:39  ccd: neat... ya the # is a "internal page" link... I forget the right term...
06:39  richardwhiuk: anchor link
06:39  richardwhiuk: the *correct* solution is to fix up your internal links, and do redirects on external links
06:39  ccd: right. thanks.
06:39  chouchou: hello, what is the difference between <br> and <br/> ?
06:40  richardwhiuk: if your using MW, you should be able to change it's link generation
06:40  ccd: well... I have a very special purpose... the page names need to be hashes... but I wont bug you with that...
06:40  richardwhiuk: chouchou: <br /> is XML style, as it requires all tags to be closed
06:40  chouchou: ok
06:40  ccd: is there any other wat to append to a URL other than ? and #?
06:41  richardwhiuk: ccd: have you considerd doing /pagehas/pagetitle/ and then rewriting them to that and ignoring the second half?
06:41  ccd: richardwhiuk: that would be the subpages feature of MW... yes I looked into that a bit...
06:42  richardwhiuk: ccd: you don't have to use mediawiki in the same way as wikipedia :-)
06:42  ccd: ha! totally.
06:42  ccd: I am using SMW
06:43  ccd: wikipedia wont install SMW... it's some cool stuff.
06:43  ccd: SemanticMediawiki
06:43  ccd: I will look into url re-writing via MW's own interface
07:02  Figaroo: So how could I hold a second "disabled" value for a checkbox element?
07:03  Figaroo: I'm making a script that will take all input[type=checkbox] elements and turn them into something like http://awardwinningfjords.com/2009/06/16/iphone-style-checkboxes.html
07:09  richardwhiuk: disabled value?
07:09  richardwhiuk: if you can select three values, you need a radio button
07:10  richardwhiuk: normally a checkbox is disabled based on other information (if if you have a checkbox saying do you live in new york, this could be disabled if they said no to do you live in the USA?)
07:10  richardwhiuk: in which case it doesn't matter what value you store, as the info is irrelevant
07:13  Figaroo: well, I'm looking to create a switch type of user input, so I need two values on or off, and they both need to be submitted.
07:13  Figaroo: With a checkbox, if the checkbox isn't checked, no value is submitted to the back-end script which is not what I want.
07:14  Figaroo: So, I've been using a hidden input with the disabled value before the checkbox
07:15  Figaroo: for example: <input type='hidden' name='field_name' value='0'/> <input type='checkbox' name='field_name' value='1'/>
07:15  Figaroo: if the checkbox is checked, then it will override the hidden input's value submitted. If it's not checked, then the hidden input will act as a fallback.
07:16  Figaroo: This is what I'm doing for checkboxes, but maybe I'd be better off using radio buttons for my javascript powered switch field.
07:20  richardwhiuk: why do they both need to be submitted?
07:20  richardwhiuk: is your backend unable to do isset()
07:23  Figaroo: richardwhiuk, the issue is that my back-end script shouldn't "unset" fields that aren't submitted.
07:24  richardwhiuk: what?
07:25  Figaroo: I have multiple pages with different form fields, and my back-end script handles each of these pages' forms. Fields from other pages shouldn't be reset or emptied if a form doesn't send them.
07:26  richardwhiuk: ah right I think I understand
07:26  richardwhiuk: two options: 1) send the data you already knew about in a hidden field
07:26  richardwhiuk: 2) use a radio burron
07:26  richardwhiuk: *button
07:27  Figaroo: In other words, dump all the current field data in block of hidden inputs at the beginning of my form for each of my pages?
07:30  Figaroo: That seems a bit redundant, seems just as practical to use a hidden input for all my checkboxes. But sense the user wont be seeing the checkbox (at least when the user has JS enabled), then maybe I could go with a radio button.
07:33  richardwhiuk: I doubt your hidden field is reliable on all browsers
07:36  tyrone: anyone know how to add a file written on the fly to resources so that java.net.URL url =  myapp.class.getResource("myFile.html") will work? or am I missing it?

19:12  defunct: Hello, if I were to make a js "slideshow" that has a lot of text on it (but that would be an image) what would be the best way to SEO it?
19:13  llrcombs: make the text all be in hidden <div>s and show it with JS
19:13  llrcombs: that way the search engines can see the text, but it's hidden from the user until the slideshow gets around to it
19:14  defunct: yeah I thinking of just text-indent: -9999px; on some divs
19:14  defunct: since I will never show the text as it will be included in the image
19:14  defunct: just wondering if it's good practice or not
19:18  riven: defunct: if it's lots of text, it's *never* good practice to have it be part of the image, even if you include hidden text alternative.
19:20  defunct: riven: it's like a header and a paragraph. But it's styled insane, would be near impossible to do with html/css
19:21  defunct: riven: what's the difference as far as search engines are concerned, as well as providing alt text
19:21  riven: Perhaps you should question whether or not this "insane styling" is really necessary? :)
19:21  riven: Hint: it's not.
19:21  defunct: riven: I didn't design this
19:22  defunct: I'm sure you can undestand that when given something to do, that the client likes, it has to be that way
19:22  riven: Well, talk to the designer then. Tell them web !- print.
19:22  riven: !=*
19:22  riven: defunct: No. Part of your job is to educate the client.
19:22  defunct: yeah, that's not an option
19:22  defunct: it's not my client either
19:22  riven: Too many clients confuse the web with print.

21:34  BrandonE: either way, it seems like the concept of media queries that you can use for CSS would work beautifully here for JS
21:36  riven: BrandonE: perhaps, but since JS, unlike CSS, is a programming language there's no real need; you can almost always rely on feature detection.
21:37  BrandonE: riven: I guess, but can Javascript really include a file persay?

21:39  riven: BrandonE: There's various options: always include the script, but don't run anything unless feature detection shows you want to. Or, do feature detection from a "main" javascript file and conditionally load the dependency if needed (XHR).
21:48  BrandonE: riven: That's weird. When I load it via Javascript, even if I don't have a condition, the issue seems to go away
21:49  BrandonE: then again, I'm not able to test if it works on a mobile device just yet
21:49  riven: Probably not, then :p
21:50  BrandonE: it's definitely loading though
21:51  riven: Loading *what*?
21:55  BrandonE: riven: The file. I've tested with an alert. It's definitely being loaded
22:46  Justus: hi
22:46  Justus: I want to write an SVG inside a html document, how can I do that?
22:48  Justus: that is not by reference to an external document, but by directly writing into the html code, any ideas?
22:52  joseph: hm
22:53  joseph: I think I've seen that done with images. Not sure about SVGs, though.
22:55  Justus: hm, well I'll do it by a reference *sigh* seems like it's too complicated still ^^
22:56  joseph: Not sure if this will help, Justus: http://jimbojw.com/wiki/index.php?title=Data_URIs_and_Inline_Images
22:57  joseph: Yeah, I don't think you can with SVG.
22:57  joseph: What's wrong with a reference?
22:57  Justus: it's a context problem, I got all the data and stuff to handle it in the script, now I have to juggle another jumping off point in it
23:00  joseph: Well, I wish you the best of luck. You might consider asking in #javascript for good measure.
