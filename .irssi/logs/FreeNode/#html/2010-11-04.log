13:29  enerel: i have multiple submit buttons, it was working ehen i used <input type='submit'> but when i changed into multiple <button type='submit'>the form does not work why?
13:30  KucukMubasir: can I see if my credentials in a POST request send in plaintext or encrypted via firebug?
13:33  enerel: anyone have any idea?
13:33  [wito]: KucukMubasir: Are you using HTTPS?
13:33  [wito]: enerel: What do you mean by "doesn't work"?
13:33  KucukMubasir: [wito]: no
13:34  [wito]: KucukMubasir: Then they are sent in plain text
13:34  KucukMubasir: I can encrypt them in client and send that way over HTTP ?
13:34  [wito]: KucukMubasir: I suppose you *could*; but there are very few crypto packages for JS, for whatever reason. P:
13:35  KucukMubasir: then why do some sites still prefer credentials to be sent over HTTP? isn't that substantially critical enough?
13:35  enerel: [wito]: i cannot see parametrs in fire bug the form doesn not submit
13:36  [wito]: enerel: Have you set the value parameter on the <button>?
13:36  enerel: do i have to
13:36  enerel: holy cow
13:36  [wito]: Not sure
13:36  [wito]: What browser?
13:37  enerel: [wito]: i forgot value tnx a lot
13:38  enerel: it works now
13:50  GarethAdams|Work: KucukMubasir: client-side encryption doesn't work
13:50  Craig`: morning.
13:50  KucukMubasir: GarethAdams|Work: so only way is HTTPS ?
13:51  GarethAdams|Work: KucukMubasir: if the server is expecting encrypted credentials and you encrypt it client side, as soon as you send those over HTTP I can see what you're sending and replay that to the server
13:52  GarethAdams|Work: KucukMubasir: sure, I can't see the actual password, but I don't need the password to authenticate any more, I need whatever you've encrypted it as
13:52  KucukMubasir: you are right
13:52  KucukMubasir: but you can't use it always; it will be stale after a while. what was the name of that token :S something like nomen, nomic :S
13:53  GarethAdams|Work: sure, well you could make the encryption key single-use
13:53  GarethAdams|Work: but since you have to tell me the encryption key over HTTP, I can still sniff *that*
13:54  KucukMubasir: GarethAdams|Work: there are abundant top web sites that won't use HTTPS; is using plainttext credentials really that dangerous?
13:54  GarethAdams|Work: yes, there may well be a way to make it work client side, but SSL is the *real* solution
13:54  GarethAdams|Work: KucukMubasir: I take it you've heard of Firesheep?
13:54  ZombieLoffe: Was just about to say firesheep, heh
13:55  KucukMubasir: GarethAdams|Work: no, I haven't :S
13:56  GarethAdams|Work: KucukMubasir: I'll give you a few minutes then
13:56  KucukMubasir: yes, I am installing it :)
13:56  GarethAdams|Work: well, reading about it would be better
13:56  GarethAdams|Work: meanwhile
13:56  KucukMubasir: is the reason firesheep can sniff all the credentials is just because of plaintext?
13:57  KucukMubasir: credentials just*
13:57  GarethAdams|Work: yes
13:57  KucukMubasir: and the only viable solution is https?
13:57  GarethAdams|Work: because session IDs are passed as in plaintext over HTTP
13:57  [wito]: not just the only viable solution: The only solution.
13:58  GarethAdams|Work: well, there could also be a better solution implemented than session IDs in cookies
13:58  GarethAdams|Work: but that would require rearchitecturing *something* about the internet, and no one has come up with a solution about what would need to change
13:58  KucukMubasir: you really enlightened me guys; I will read a book about https and ssl asap.
13:58  KucukMubasir: thanks for your help
14:06  Tatsh: what do you guys think would be the right way (even if unimplemented at the moment) to write a song artist and title on the same line with proper semantic HTML?
14:06  Tatsh: i'm only thinking <cite>
14:06  Tatsh: almost*
14:06  Tatsh: example: Eric M & Lauren Angel - Jingle Tangle (this is how most people do it on-line atm)
14:07  Tatsh: <label>Eric M &amp; Lauren Angel</label>&nbsp<em>Jingle Tangle</em>
14:07  Tatsh: and label in my stylesheet is always bold
14:07  [wito]: Erm, I don't think label mean what you think it means.
14:07  Craig`: [wito], i'm just messing around with geolocation api and i'd like for the result to be displayed on google maps, what would be the best way to do this, others are using iframes, i guess i could just redirect to the google map url itself, have any better ideas?
14:07  [wito]: and why the &nbsp;?
14:07  [wito]: Craig`: I HAVE NO CRAIGGLES!
14:08  Craig`: heh.
14:08  Tatsh: [wito] to give it a space without using a real ' '
14:08  [wito]: Tatsh: wut
14:08  [wito]: why not use a real ' '?
14:08  Tatsh: label is used on my form elements but i don't see a reason why it can't be used for anything
14:08  Tatsh: else
14:08  Lazylegs: Tatsh, maybe definition list could be good.. <dl><dt>Artist</dt><dd>Song name</dd></dl>
14:09  Tatsh: ah!
14:09  Tatsh: forgot about that
14:09  [wito]: Not really.
14:09  Tatsh: can a dl be numbered?
14:09  Lazylegs: Why not wito?
14:09  Tatsh: <li>Utopia - 'Angels' (feat Charlie) (7" Radio Mix)</li> sticking with this for now
14:09  Tatsh: within an <ol>
14:10  Craig`: wouldn't a heading and then an ordered list be more appropriate? as a definition list would basically be saying, the definition for Michael Jackson is 'Man In The Mirror'
14:10  [wito]: Tatsh: I'd perhaps say <li><span>Artist</span> <span>Song</span></li>
14:10  Tatsh: [wito] yea i know but i don't see the point in those spans
14:11  [wito]: then add the dash using .songlist li span:first-child:after() { content: "â€“"; }
14:11  Tatsh: well that'll be wonderful for IE
14:11  Lazylegs: Craig`, ok.. semantically it is bit off :) when you put it like that :D
14:11  Tatsh: 50% of my visitors are IE
14:11  Tatsh: the other half are safari/firefox about 30/20
14:11  [wito]: Tatsh: You asked for something, even if unimplemented
14:12  Tatsh: yeah i suppose
14:12  [wito]: OH SNAP!
14:12  [wito]: But seriously, fuck IE and fuck lameoid users refusing or being to stupid to update their software.
14:13  Tatsh: yea i know and agree
14:13  Tatsh: js performance on IE is bullshit
14:13  [wito]: And the semantically correct place to put things like separator characters is "not in the fucking HTML text, dumbass".
14:13  Tatsh: i'd like to be semantically correct as much as possible
14:14  Tatsh: in the sense that things like separators are not in the html text
14:14  [wito]: Then you'll be using :before(), :after() and content: a lot
14:14  Tatsh: is there an element (maybe coming later) that automatically quotes?
14:14  [wito]: <q>
14:14  Tatsh: is that already working in browsers?
14:15  [wito]: should be
14:15  [wito]: most browsers, anyway
14:15  [wito]: but it's not for quoting text.
14:15  [wito]: Well, erm
14:15  [wito]: It *is* for quoting text; not for putting text in quotes.
14:16  [wito]: For example, Sarcastic "bunny ears" should not be made with <q>, but actually in text.
14:16  [wito]: (confused yet?)
14:16  Tatsh: so what about my preferred single quotes
14:16  Tatsh: i never use double quotes
14:17  Tatsh: except in PHP "\n" for example where it's kind of necessary :P
14:17  [wito]: That's just stupid.
14:18  [wito]: On a related note, it's reccomended to use quotes (not apostrophes) for quoting HTML attributes
14:18  [wito]: i.e. <a href="#">, not <a href='#'>
14:20  Craig`: [wito], i just decided to use client side redirect
14:21  [wito]: ugh
14:21  [wito]: liek, eww
14:22  Craig`: i know :(
14:22  Craig`: well, what would you suggest, it's only client side atm, no server side.
14:23  [wito]: get a proper fucking host so you can run proper fucking scripts to do proper fucking redirects. Scallawag.
14:23  Craig`: i've got a "proper fucking host"
14:26  riven: [wito] needs a hug
14:27  Craig`: he's all yours
14:42  GarethAdams|Work: I've never seen anyone suggest using one kind of attribute quote over another with a decent reason
14:43  riven: convention
14:44  riven: does i win??
14:44  GarethAdams|Work: which is the convention? I've never seen anyone suggest that either is better than the other
14:44  [wito]: GarethAdams|Work: There's also that HTML has &quot; but not &apos;; and the apostrophe is a bit more common than quotes, at least in English.
14:45  riven: GarethAdams|Work: conventions aren't necessarily about being better
14:45  GarethAdams|Work: riven: no, but you need a reason to start using one over the other
14:46  [wito]: See above.
14:46  [wito]: That's two reasons, right there.
14:46  riven: GarethAdams|Work: no, some things just happen. Oversimplified example: Person 1 starts using double quites, for no good reason other than simply having to pick one. Person 2 sees person 1's code and copies the style, etc...
14:46  riven: quotes, too.
14:48  GarethAdams|Work: ok, then the step from convention in that case, to recommendation, is based on naivety
14:48  asx: hi guys
14:48  KucukMubasir: can I login a site by just setting document.cookie with a valid one?
14:48  GarethAdams|Work: [wito]: valid point certainly I guess, for people who hand-edit their HTML
14:49  riven: GarethAdams|Work: how so? Is there a good reason to deviate from the convention? If not, then there's your reason to recommend the convention.
14:50  KucukMubasir: GarethAdams|Work: can you help me with my question?
14:51  riven: KucukMubasir: off-topic, this is #html.
14:51  KucukMubasir: KucukMubasir: well, we have been talking about that topic with GarethAdams|Work
14:52  riven: Try #web.
14:52  GarethAdams|Work: riven: I don't know, I consider a recommendation to require a positive, not just the lack of a negative
14:52  GarethAdams|Work: riven: and "Everyone else does it" - if it is a valid reason - stinks of naivety
14:52  riven: GarethAdams|Work: if there is a lack of a negative, surely it would be convenient if as many people as possible stick to the convention?
14:53  GarethAdams|Work: riven: hence my initial qualifier "with a decent reason"
14:53  asx: hey guys... i'm trying to put a flash object and it don't works on internet explorer. Here is the code: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02h
14:53  asx: what is wrong guys?
14:54  riven: `flash @ asx
14:54  rivvles: asx, Cross-browser, valid Flash embedding: http://reisio.com/examples/flash/ ï¿½ Also see http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/, http://alistapart.com/articles/flashembedcagematch
14:55  asx: ok thanks
14:58  KucukMubasir: how may I use an existing cookie to login a site?
14:59  KucukMubasir: javascript:document.cookie="foo"; is this the way?
14:59  Craig`: ##javascript, and don't use javascript in the URL
14:59  [wito]: GarethAdams|Work: I'll repeat and rephrase my earlier stated, decent, reason: Using quotes over apostrophes makes escaping simpler, and makes you less likely to have to escape in the first place.
15:00  GarethAdams|Work: [wito]: sure, if you're hand-building your HTML then it's a fair comment
15:01  [wito]: It also impacts the size of the resulting HTML file, no matter the producer used
15:01  GarethAdams|Work: [wito]: escaping is something which should be handled by a CMS though
15:01  riven: *should*?
15:01  riven: So everyone *should* always use a CMS?
15:01  GarethAdams|Work: no, I didn't say that
15:02  GarethAdams|Work: but if you were using a CMS it would be a bad CMS if it didn't help with that
15:02  riven: And I didn't claim you said that... you implied it. :)
15:03  riven: And even when using a CMS... when using a decent CMS, you're still writing the templates/xslts by hand, as it should be.
15:03  GarethAdams|Work: [wito]: &quot; vs &#39;
15:05  [wito]: title="Don't click this button" vs. title='Don&#39;t click this button'
15:05  GarethAdams|Work: but really, when you're talking about being more likely to have an apostrophe than a quote, you mean saving a couple of bytes in a few select cases
15:06  GarethAdams|Work: call me when that's a bottleneck for you
15:06  [wito]: P:
15:08  GarethAdams|Work: if you're gzipping your content, you'll probably only be losing those couple of bytes a maximum of once per page
15:36  Azrael_-: hi
15:37  Azrael_-: i set "width: 98%" to <input type="text"> using css. in ie8/ff everything is fine. in ie7 the box is reduced to about 10px width for no reason. any idea why?
15:37  riven: Azrael_-: see channel topic
15:37  Azrael_-: ok

16:40  mrbrdo: some time ago, i heard that HTML5 won't have an XHTML version.. but after some googling today, it seems there will be one. any idea which version will be better supported / more widely used?
16:41  Pilum: You're being confused.
16:41  Pilum: HTML5 will be HTML. Nothing more, nothing less. However, it *will* support shorttags syntax.
16:41  mrbrdo: your point being?
16:41  mrbrdo: that's not what i asked
16:41  ZombieLoffe: There's also XHTML5.
16:42  Pilum: It's not XHTML, but it can look like it.
16:42  mrbrdo: i never said it was
16:42  ZombieLoffe: I suspect XHTML5 won't see much useage at all, though
16:42  mrbrdo: ZombieLoffe thanks, that what i wanted to know
16:52  ormaaj: Actually somewhat recently XHTML5 became the official name for HTML5 in XML
16:54  riven: heh, official.
16:54  ormaaj: We'll see, on the one hand whatwg seems rather anti-xml, but on the other I think they just don't care. HTML5 is all about DOM and JS stuff anyway
16:55  riven: XHTML is dead, get over it already. :)
16:55  riven: My favourite line.
16:56  ormaaj: riven: as "official" as people consider whatwg I suppose
16:56  riven: on the subject of HTML5, much more official than w3c AFAIC.
16:57  riven: actually, official isn't the right word
16:58  riven: but the whatwg was and is the driving force behind HTML5, not the w3c
16:59  ormaaj: XHTML as in the XHTML 1.1/2.0 track is dead. But I think eventually HTML will go away and we'll be using XML in browsers just like we do everywhere else.
16:59  riven: Sweet dreams ;)
16:59  riven: any unicorns about?
16:59  Pilum: Even webservices is starting to move away from XML. :-P
16:59  ormaaj: what are you going to do... add another tag every time there's a new type of internet media?
16:59  ormaaj: XML is the strictly superior language in every possible way
17:00  ormaaj: there's no way HTML will work in the long run
17:00  ormaaj: except the draconian error handling
17:00  ormaaj: that has to be addressed
17:01  ormaaj: not a good reason to throw away the language though.
17:02  mrbrdo: i prefer html over xhtml
17:03  ormaaj: What's there to prefer?
17:03  ormaaj: Its XML minus the power
17:03  mrbrdo: why would i want to write <br /> when i can write <br>
17:03  ormaaj: and general usefulness
17:03  mrbrdo: XML is full of clutter
17:03  riven: ormaaj: for starters, XML, despite its name, isn't really a language itself. What you seem to mean is XHTML, and XHTML doesn't work with "custom tags" any better than HTML does. Inventing your own tags doesn't get you any semantics (or functionality/an api, as is needed for things like <canvas>)
17:04  riven: and elements without semantics are useless, we already have div and span for that.
17:05  riven: You can extend semantics with technologies like microformats, RDFa, microdata etc.
17:05  riven: So yeah, XHTML is dead.
17:05  ormaaj: riven: Exploiting tags for semantics is a bad idea for the same reason relying upon hungarian notation for semantics in a programming language is a bad idea. I want to have a way to explicitly bind the presentational features of a browser to a document.
17:05  riven: wut
17:05  riven: you lost me
17:06  Craig`: wat
17:06  riven: wot
17:06  Craig`: wet
17:06  riven: wet and wit don't really work :|
17:06  Craig`: i know, they're real words!
17:06  ormaaj: riven: exactly, semantics should be bound to the document in an external way through something like RDFa.
17:07  riven: ormaaj: so you agree then, no need for XHTML.
17:07  riven: Thanks :)
17:07  ormaaj: sort of
17:07 * riven grins
17:09  ormaaj: I basically think all documents should be XML files where we use something like XML binding language to create mappings between the presentational and semantic capabilities of user agents and XML tags. Then you just create a profile for use in web browsers that everyone agrees to use.
17:09  riven: Why would that require XML?
17:11  Pilum: ormaaj apparently has XMLitis. :-P
17:11  riven: Must be the X :|
17:11  Pilum: Possibly hehe.
17:12  ormaaj: Why create a special purpose language? This makes it extensible because the presentation is made explicit. If a browser adds a feature then it is explicitly bound with a tag via some external mechanism. You could then access all of the features of the browser through any XML language, though most of the time it would be the "HTML" variant.
17:12  riven: HTML is not an XML language.
17:12  riven: Derp.
17:12  mrbrdo: wasn't HTML before XML btw?
17:12  Pilum: Yes.
17:12  ormaaj: XHTML is an XML vocabulary - albeit it doens't quite achieve that end because certain things are still implicit
17:12  Pilum: Both being based on SGML.
17:12  riven: More importantly, none of what you suggest requires XML.
17:13  ormaaj: why wouldn't you use it though
17:13  ormaaj: what makes browsers so special that they should use their own langauge that's almost but not quite XML?
17:13  riven: Because of the downsides :)
17:14  riven: Hence why the web at large is moving away from XHTML :)
17:14  ormaaj: there are no downsides to more generality
17:14  ormaaj: no
17:15  stanmancan: Is there any way to break out of iframes? We have a service where if our script is on yoru page we'll scan the page content for offensive material. Sometimes though, scripts will call scripts which will call us, so we can be nested inside iframes. Some comeptitors claim random numbers. "We can break out of 7 iFrames!". Some of them claim 1... 7.... 23 iframes.. Any ideas?
17:15  riven: oh god
17:15  riven: brb, throwing up
17:16  riven: stanmancan: and erm, don't cross-post
17:16  ormaaj: ugh... frames
17:17  ormaaj: riven: look what you've done with your HTML!
17:17  riven: ormaaj: bad joke, I presume?
17:18  Visage: 23 iframes, ololol. Good times today.
17:19  riven: Nested. :)
17:19  Visage: Beautiful.
17:19  stanmancan: welcome to the online ad industry
17:20  riven: Welcome to find a better job
17:20  stanmancan: tags get passed around like cheap hookers
17:20  Pilum: I disagree.
17:20  Visage: This totally beats my 500-div challenge.
17:20  Pilum: Cheap hookers have more style than that.
17:20  stanmancan: it can go from the original ad company, to a network, who puts in the original tag and spits out their tag, which goes to an ad exchange who does the same thing, ect.
17:20  riven: Yeah, like my m... err.
17:21  stanmancan: and for whatever reason every single hop likes to load the incoming tag in an iframe and spit it out
17:21  stanmancan: aka every hope between networks can easily result in another nested iframe
17:23  riven: I say burn them all.
17:23  stanmancan: i know right?
17:27  ormaaj: Google = online ad industry
17:27  ormaaj: I'm not opposed to them hiring me.
17:27  EGreg_: ey guys
17:27  EGreg_: how can I make an HTML field such that the browser fills in a previous value
17:27  EGreg_: like if the user previously entered a value there
17:28  riven: um, that would be the default behaviour
17:28  EGreg_: I thought it would happen autoomatically
17:28  Pilum: Nothing to do with HTML either.
17:28  riven: Pilum: well, it does, sort of - @autocomplete
17:28  Pilum: That's in the HTML specs is it?
17:28  riven: uhu.
17:29  Pilum: Hm.
17:30  riven: de facto standard, formally standardized by HTML5... EGreg_, try explicitly setting autocomplete="on"
17:30  EGreg_: ah, okay I will try
17:31  EGreg_: it kind of works
17:31  EGreg_: now it shows an autocomplete
17:31  EGreg_: but I am talking about autofill
17:31  EGreg_: you know, like many browsers do
17:31  riven: derp
17:31  riven: that would be browser feature
17:31  riven: be a*
17:32  EGreg_: yeah, but how do I allow it to happen
17:32  riven: Consult your browser's user guide.
17:32  EGreg_: what is this, 1980?
17:32  blazedd: Anyone here have much experience with HTML5 ?
17:33  EGreg_: facebook.com -- see how it autofills?
