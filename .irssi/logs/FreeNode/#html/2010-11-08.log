04:09  chuy_max: hey guys, should <select> and <input> tags be inside <p>?, or can that be avoided
04:11  Visage: chuy_max, Why would they need to be? Think about what <p> is.
04:11  Visage: A paragraph of text, not a paragraph of inputs. That just sounds silly, eh? :)
04:12  Visage: If you must put them inside a block element, div is fine.
04:12  chuy_max: Visage, that's what I thought, http://htmldog.com/guides/htmlbeginner/forms/
04:12  chuy_max: if you see the examples, you can see input tags inside <p>
04:13  chuy_max: I know this channel endorses htmldog.com
04:13  Visage: We do.
04:13  Visage: Thankfully that's only a form example. :) While it might work, it certainly won't be correct.
04:14  Visage: Also, that form has copious amounts of <p>. They should've at least used some <label> elements for some of that text.
04:15  chuy_max: ok :)
04:15  Visage: Example: <label for="name">Name</label> <input type="text" name="name" id="name"> would be more appropriate.
04:19  chuy_max: that's right. I really like the website, it just contained that little detail I was not sure about. Thanks for clarifying.
04:20  chuy_max: I really like to code following standards. Everytime I open html code from someone else, I see this guys coding without following it (like not using doctypes, using tables as layouts, not closing tags appropriately, etc).
04:20  Visage: Eww. :)
04:20  Visage: All naughty.
04:21  CoJaBo: l lol
04:21  Visage: CoJaBo, WHO SAID YOU COULD TALK? HUH?!
04:22 * Visage suspends CoJaBo for "lol"ing.
04:23 * CoJaBo hits ctrl + q
04:23  CoJaBo: :D
04:24  cmrn: LOL
05:03  cesurasean: hello
05:03  Visage: YOU.
05:03  Visage: I know you. :)
05:06  will_laptop: Is  both <html lang="en-us"> and <html lang="en"> correct?
05:08  Visage: will_laptop, Yes.
05:08  Visage: Well, en-US, but yes. :)
05:09 * cmrn salts visage in the en-us
05:09  will_laptop: yes, sorry s/us/US
05:10  Visage: And if you want to have some real fun, have a look at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt
05:10  cmrn: > Implying reading RFC docs are ever fun
05:10  Visage: Sure they are. :) Fun is relative.
05:11  cmrn: just like your en-us
05:11  Visage: You know it.
05:12  cesurasean: Visage, I decided to keep my tags and go with the design. saved copies of the crap html5 designs...
05:13  cesurasean: seems that's the best move for me right now
05:13  cesurasean: #css isn't too friendly
05:14  Visage: I believe they were quite friendly with you.
05:16  cmrn: you havent seen mean.
05:18  CoJaBo: mean(2,3,4) = 3
05:18  Visage: CoJaBo, You suck at being funny.
05:18  cmrn: mean(cmrn, Visage, CoJaBo, riven) = riven
05:18  Visage: Just like you suck at...everything else. :)
05:19  cmrn: ...at the street corner
05:19  CoJaBo: Hey, at least I cont give up =D
05:19  Visage: cmrn, riven is meaner than I am? Srsly?
05:19  CoJaBo: dont
05:19  cmrn: to me, at least
05:19  cmrn: </3
05:19  Visage: Haha.
05:19  Visage: He's mean because he cares.
05:19  Visage: It's called tough love, bro. :)
05:20  cmrn: no homo
05:20  Visage: Bromance.

06:02 --- Channel #html was synced in 191 seconds
06:18  chuy_max: hey guys, should HTML 4.0 single tags be written like this: <tag />
07:06  CoJaBo: chuy_max: No. Thats XHTML.
07:07  CoJaBo: (Which you shouldnt be using)
07:28 --- DaddyLou is now known as LouCypher
07:33  chuy_max: CoJaBo, what would be the reason to not use XHTML?
07:35  huckfinnaafb: does anyone here use HAML
07:37  cesurasean: http://www.webdevout.net/test?03r&raw - Can someone tell me why I'm getting errors about this form?
07:39  cesurasean: huckfinnaafb, they told me the same thing, i tried html5, and my design messed up. so, believe what you want to hear.
07:39  cesurasean: i would say stick with whatever you have been using.
07:40  huckfinnaafb: wait, whut
07:40  huckfinnaafb: whats wrong with your form?
07:41  cmrn: cesurasean, if your page broke upgrading to html5, that's a sign of a poorly coded page
07:41  cmrn: no offence.
07:41  cesurasean: nevermind
07:41  cesurasean: i figured it out
07:41  cesurasean: cmrn, so you are saying it's possible to have the same effect as using different code?

08:09  qfr: http://siyobik.info/css/ <- check the postTree ul at the end - it gets drawn inside the unitContainer div although it is outside the div. I guess that's because of position: absolute in the unitContainer which I used to draw the line numbers right next to the corresponding lines. How can I get the postTree root/No description stuff to render below the div?

08:49  destinydriven: hey guys, I need some help turning this table into a div 'table' http://pastie.org/1280984
08:50  destinydriven: do I just replace all the table tags with divs?
08:53  Northwoods: destinydriven: http://bonrouge.com/~div-table
08:53  destinydriven: Northwoods: thanks
08:54  destinydriven: how do I define a header row like that?
08:56  Northwoods: destinydriven: define some css for it , background-color:#ff0000 , something like that
08:57  destinydriven: ahh ok, thought there was more to it
08:58  destinydriven: I got this jsgrid plugin which needs tables in div form  . . . you've been a great help
08:58  destinydriven: my initial reaction was shock . . now I can feel my way through it :)
10:28  osfd: Hi there, do you know something equivalent to doodle but not fr scheduling but fr random choices ?
14:04  dogmatic69: hi all, i was giving placeholder a go and its blank :/ does it not work on ff 3.x latest?
14:04  dogmatic69: or is there more to it than placeholder='abc'
14:05  riven: dogmatic69: think it's Fx4+
14:05  dogmatic69: thought so
14:06  dogmatic69: ill try chrome quick
14:06  dogmatic69: cool, it is ff's lack of support
14:41  Innocentus: Hallo!
14:42  Innocentus: Anyone online?

14:42  rivvles: Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help. Just ask your question or state your problem and wait. Oh, and be sure to read the channel topic.
14:42  Innocentus: `ask not
14:42  rivvles: Innocentus, command 'ask not' not found. Try `search <query> to search for commands.
14:43  Innocentus: I want to center to the content-part of a layout absolutely to the logo in the horizontal navigation bar.
14:43  Innocentus: http://www.phpforum.de/forum/showthread.php?t=257682
14:43  [wito]: Innocentus: What part of "Read the channel topic" don't you understand?
14:43  riven: Innocentus: can you read? You don't seem to have read the channel /topic.
14:44  riven: LOL

14:44  Innocentus: it is about html

14:44  riven: No it's not.
14:44  [wito]: Innocentus: Read all of it.
14:45  Innocentus: css for styling?

14:45  [wito]: Bingo!
14:45  riven: Hallelujah.
14:45  Innocentus: ah
14:45  Innocentus: darn, very friendly people here :(
14:46  [wito]: We're just swell.
14:46  [wito]: But seriously; "Don't ask to ask." and "Read the topic." are two extremely base rules of IRC.
