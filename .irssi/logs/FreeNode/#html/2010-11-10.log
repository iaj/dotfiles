13:10  boogyman: blip-: what are you looking for?
13:10  riven: done spamming?
13:11  riven: try reading the channel topic
13:11  riven: idiot
13:11  blip-: riven, I read it, idiot, it doesn't say anything about not using the bot
13:11  riven: It tells you how to use the bot.
13:12  blip-: boogyman, I'm trying to remember what the gurus say about w3schools.com, was it negative or positive ?
13:12  boogyman: `w3schools
13:12  rivvles: W3Schools == Errors, omissions, deceit.  Stop reading/pointing to them! Syntax Errors in the example -> http://xrl.us/bfxwd | Complete bullshit -> http://xrl.us/bfxwf | Totally wrong -> http://xrl.us/bh7cag http://xrl.us/bh7cap
13:12  blip-: exactly, that was it.  thanks
13:13  blip-: riven, hmm I don't see that. I must be an idiot
13:13  boogyman: | W3C ref: say e.g. ]html div |
13:13  riven: Yes, we already established that.
13:14  blip-: that's the most obscure guide to using a bot i've ever seen...
13:14  blip-: say ]html div
13:14  blip-: ]html
13:14  riven: Oh, you wanted a *full* guide in the channel topic? Brilliant!
13:15  blip-: I didn't recognize it as related to the bot in any way.
13:15  blip-: May help if you put the word bot in there
13:15  riven: Because you're stupid. As we know.
13:15  boogyman: type ` commands without the space
13:15  blip-: riven, oh fuck off will you
13:15  blip-: boogyman, thanks.  I'm out of here
13:15  riven: Don't go and confuse him even more, boogyman :p
13:15  boogyman: confuse, or spam xD

16:10  eth: Is the usage of <dl> appropriate when I got "tabular" data but need to present it in a list. I can't see why I should be using a table for that. e.g. http://codepad.org/CTME6Bvn
16:10  riven: eth: DL is appropriate for any key/value pair data
16:11  eth: ok, thanks :)
16:11  riven: There is a certain overlap with tabular data.

22:03  zack88: hi there!
22:03  zack88: may I ask something about google code and javascript host?
22:03  Visage: zack88, Neither of which sound like HTML. :)
22:04  zack88: Visage: do you know any chan about it? however it's a problem about cachable resources on sites
22:05  zack88: the best free code hosting service that i know is google code (that i use both for js and css), but it doesn't provide cachable resources
22:49  jfalvarez: hey, somebody knows if I can play a 3gp video inside a html5 <video> tag?
22:50  riven: Sure. If the browser supports the container and contained codecs.
22:50  riven: Which basically means, just Opera on linux (through gstreamer) :)
22:51  riven: Maybe Safari through QT.
22:55  jfalvarez: actually I'm in windows, if I play directly the http://mysite/blah.3gp works, but when is in the <video> can't play it
22:55  jfalvarez: :\
22:57  riven: jfalvarez: "directly", in the browser, would be using a plugin.
22:57  riven: Through <video>, the browser has to support it natively.
22:58  jfalvarez: hum, so is chrome?
22:58  jfalvarez: oh my, in firefox I get a big X
22:58  jfalvarez: xD
