12:47  riven: Rich_Morin: #css for styling
12:49 --- Channel #html was synced in 163 seconds
12:53  Rich_Morin: Well, there _might_ have been an HTML option for this (:-).
12:57  riven: Rich_Morin: yes, that is true, but it wouldn't be a proper solution :)
12:59  riven: Rich_Morin: there are several markup-level solutions... the one you proposed in #css, injecting soft-hyphens, using the non-standard <wbr> tag, etc
13:00  Rich_Morin: The soft-hyphens don't sound like they would have the desired effect, given that the strings are not really English
13:38  atan: Rich_Morin, can you use something server side to inject a <br /> ? =)
13:40  Rich_Morin: atan: the problem with that is that it _forces_ a break.  What I want is for the browser to break at the appropriate location(s) for the width of the page (which the Server doesn't know).
13:40  atan: Okay, so put a space between each letter and use letter-spacing to bring them back together
13:40  Rich_Morin: Currently, I'm wrapping "<wbr>" around certain non-word characters.
13:41  atan: Honestly I haven't a clue ^_^ I'd throw each letter in a span perhaps
13:41  Rich_Morin: I might be able to use something other than a space; I don't really want all my spaces to disappear (:-)
13:41  Pilum: Soft-hyphens sounds like the best solution to me.
13:42  Rich_Morin: Pilum - Won't that add hyphens when it activates?
13:42  atan: &shy; ?
13:42  Pilum: Is that a problem? How else will the reader know that the word continues on the next line?
13:42  atan: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/226464/soft-hyphen-in-html-wbr-vs-shy
13:42  atan: Someone posted a neat jQuery thing there =)
13:43  Rich_Morin: FAR too hard for this time of night :)
13:44  Rich_Morin: anyway, I have other fish to fry - thanks, all
14:37  Lundy: heya guys, I was just wondering if anyone could give me some feedback on my website. www.lundy.me.uk I have coded everything up to Guestbook buy I do not feel that Guesbtook would the correct title for it now, anyone know what I might be able to replace it with
14:41  Pilum: @
14:41  _ZofBot4: (lundy.me.uk) HTML: 11 Errors (see: http://xrl.us/bhtymv ) CSS: Valid ( http://xrl.us/bhtymx ) DOCTYPE: HTML 4.01 Strict + url (MIME: text/html; charset=UTF-8 )
14:41  Pilum: ^ fix
14:44 --- Lunders is now known as Lundy
15:00  Visage: <br style="clear: left"> <- Eww.
15:00  Visage: And what Pilum said.
15:01  Visage: Lundy, And I hope you don't mean "guestbook", because those went out of style over a decade ago.
15:15  jstressman: http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d12/phreadom/nnb-daily-ie9-problem1.png   problem I'm seeing on http://nnb.me/daily/ only in IE9 beta (installed today)
15:16  jstressman: I asked in CSS already, but since it seems like there are actually people alive in here, I'm asking in here as well. ;)
15:16  jstressman: @
15:16  _ZofBot4: (nnb.me/daily/) HTML: Valid ( http://xrl.us/bh99fb ) CSS: Valid ( http://xrl.us/bh99fd ) DOCTYPE: <!doctype html> (MIME: text/html )
15:19  Pilum: CSS being slow is not a valid reason to go off-topic here.
15:20  Pilum: And if all you've given them too is an image then I can understand why they don't bother to reply.
15:21  ZombieLoffe: He did provide a link too, to be fair.
15:21  jstressman: I was about to say that.
15:22  Pilum: Ah. My apologies.
15:22  Pilum: Nevertheless, #css for CSS, #html for HTML.
15:22  ZombieLoffe: #cake for cake.
15:22  jstressman: and since almost all the styling is in-line, a simple "view source" would get what was needed.
15:22  Visage: And #cars for cheese.
15:23  Visage: amirite? :)
15:23 * jstressman rolls eyes. man I hate pedants.
15:23  Pilum: Whether the CSS is inline or in a .css file makes no difference. It's still off-topic.
15:24  jstressman: well, you know... sometimes in slow channels there are people who simply feel like being helpful. :) since these are two closely related topics where almost anyone who specializes in one, will also do so in the other.
15:25  Visage: They are not mutually exclusive.
15:25  Visage: This is why we have separate channels for these things on freenode.
15:25  jstressman: your second statement doesn't follow from your first.
15:26  jstressman: nor do either of them negate my comment.
15:26  Visage: Your comments are old hat. We've heard them before.
15:26  Visage: Now, are you going to go wait in #css for an answer like you should?
15:26  ZombieLoffe: Channels are separated for a reason.
15:27  jstressman: that's fine. I just don't like people acting pricks. :) I think I'll just go find the answer myself rather than twiddle my thumbs in the "proper" channel because a bunch of pedants can't tolerate asking a simple question in a closely related DEAD F'ING CHANNEL.
15:27  jstressman: sheesh.
15:27  ZombieLoffe: he mad
15:27  Visage: :)
15:28  Visage: Man, somebody on the internet hates me. I am devastated.
16:10  TheoMurpse: Can a TBODY not be empty without being in conflict with HTML 4.01 strict? I have a site that allows the user to add things to a table and save the data. Initially, the table is empty, so I have a THEAD with the column names in a TR, but then the TBODY is empty. When I validate the page against the W3C validator, it tells me "end tag for "TBODY" which is not finished" (looking at the code, it is <tbody></tbody>).
16:13  Azure: When the table is empty just have single row and single column that spans the entire table with a message, "Table is empty" or something like that.
16:13  Visage: TheoMurpse, Yes, tbody must contain at least one tr.
16:14  Visage: You can do what Azure suggested.
16:20  TheoMurpse: Visage Azure Thanks. I guess whenever I was running the W3C validator on it during the bulk of development, I always ran it when there was data in the table already. So I was surprised this morning to find it didn't validate.
17:03  chut: hi people
17:04  chut: how come this code doesn't show in IE , it shows in firefox
17:04  chut: <input name="send_button" src="images/send.jpg" alt="" title="Send" type="image" />

17:05  CoJaBo: is the jpg actually a jpeg?
17:05  chut: yes
17:08  chut: oh wait
17:08  chut: i open gimp and save it as jpg and it show now

17:49  chut: lol!
18:32  chut: CoJaBo, i have 1 more question. i have this image 	  <td width="323" rowspan="2"><img src="images/contact.jpg" width="325" height="460" alt="" /></td>
18:33  chut: can i move this image up about 20 pixel?
18:33  chut: not to modify the image's height
18:33  boogyman: chut: 1)remove the width and height attributes and use CSS, 2) don't use tables for layout
18:35 --- Yvemath is now known as Guest75580
18:35  chut: anyone?
18:36  boogyman: i gave you the appropriate answer
18:36 --- Yvemath_ is now known as yvemath
18:36  chut: where boogyman ?
18:36  boogyman: [12:33]	<boogyman>	chut: 1)remove the width and height attributes and use CSS, 2) don't use tables for layout
18:37  chut: ooop, my bad :D
18:37  boogyman: but, to suit ya fancy, #css knows all about the specifics :)
18:37  chut: thanks boogyman
18:37  chut: i dont know much css, let me ask them
19:20  tktiddle: How does google latitude know your location through your browser?
19:21  boogyman: tktiddle: html5 geolocation api
19:26  tktiddle: off to buy a HTML5 book.. christmas prezzy to myself
19:27  boogyman: tktiddle: don't bother buying a book
19:28  boogyman: the specification isn't in recommendation form, therefore it will likely undergo numerous changes, and in general it's not a good idea to buy a book regarding web-dev/programming as by the time it gets published it's usually 2/3 versions out of date
19:32  CoJaBo: lol
19:32  tktiddle: blush
21:10 --- emma is now known as em
22:33  axle3d: so what is preffered when you format your html code, do you indent it (like programming languages) or leave it in a 'flat' structure?
22:34  boogyman: developer / organization preference, rendering engine's ignore whitespace
