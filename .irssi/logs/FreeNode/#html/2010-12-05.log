21:50  wabash: I've got a block quote, and since it's a poem, it has 4 lines. Whats the best way to make a line break within a blockquote?
21:50  boogyman: <br>
21:50  wabash: boogyman: Ok, thanks. I have heard numerous times that <br> is to be avoided. Is this only in the case of formatting?
21:51  boogyman: This is one of the few semantically appropriate uses of the <br> tag though, so don't believe it's used all over the place
21:51  wabash: ok, thank you. Sholud it be "<br>" or "<br\>"?
21:52  boogyman: doctype: xhtml for the latter, html for the former
21:52  wabash: boogyman: I see, thank you. Is one backwards compantible with the other?
21:53  Pilum: Stick to HTML.
21:53  Pilum: XHTML is pointless for most public sites.
21:53  Pilum: And in any case it's <br/>
21:53  wabash: I see. Well, at the top of the page source is DTD XHTML transitional already (added by CMS). So what should I do in this case?
21:53  Pilum: Switch to a less sucky CMS.
21:54  wabash: Given that I cannot, what would be the correct tag to use?
21:54  boogyman: wabash: XHTML was a technology developed to integrate xml based data into layouts, however it was never adopted by IE, therefore true XHTML is not possible and thus impractical for most public sites, as stated by pilum
21:54  Pilum: Transtional doctypes are not to be used except when transitioning between one version to another.
21:54  Pilum: Since you're not, it should at the very least be strict.
21:54  wabash: boogyman: So, what's the implication? That <br> will be just fine, and don't worry about using <br/>?
21:55  Pilum: No, if you're using XHTML then <br/> is correct. I'm telling you to not use XHTML, however.
21:55  wabash: Pilum: Right. I'll keep that in mind for when I make my own pages and can choose my own DTD.
21:55  boogyman: wabash: The transitional doctype was created to allow legacy code to be valid during the transition from HTML strict to XHTML strict, however, was never meant as a "permanent" doctype
21:56  wabash: Yeah, can't control how retarded my CMS is or not, sorry. I'm just trying to match the appropriate usage of tags to the current doctype, that's all.
21:56  Pilum: boogyman: It's more general than that heh. It exists for HTML 4.01 too, for transitioning from HTML 3.2.
21:57  Pilum: wabash: Sure you can. Modify it. :-)
22:00  wabash: Pilum: No, I can't. That's not my situation. All that I have control over is the body. I can't change the header.
22:10 * Visage recommends a less fail CMS, like MODx.
22:10  Visage: If it ever comes to a point that you're able to switch, anyway.
22:11  Boohemian: hello, would anyone here be willing to take a look at a page on my website and give me concrete ideas on how best to make it look appealing? it is 12 pages long (from a word document) of text, broken up by 15 subheaders...
22:13  wabash: Visage: Thank you.
22:18  Pilum: Boohemian: I would suggest that's a topic better suited for #web
