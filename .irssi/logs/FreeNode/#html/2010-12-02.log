16:28  miha: gedit doesnt, i tried saving with notepad++ without BOM... and no difference. is it always first char? or ? :)
16:28  ZombieLoffe: in notepad++ it's under the encoding menu
16:28  miha: well i dont know which of the included files to edit, if only i saw it somewhere? :)
16:28  miha: any editor on linux that shows it? :)
16:28  Visage: miha, Then you better resave them all. :)
16:28  miha: hex?
16:29  miha: Visage no i would wget the built page and just replace it with some visible char? :)
16:29  miha: then i see where to edit
16:29  Visage: Huh?
16:30  miha: well
16:30  miha: i just want to see that damned char
16:30  miha: next to what it is
16:30  Visage: You don't need to see it. Just resave your documents with no BOM and you'll be fine.
16:31  Visage: And woe is you if you have a bazillion documents with a BOM. :)
16:31 --- Channel #html was synced in 237 seconds
16:31  Visage: Anyway, the BOM is unicode U+FEFF at the beginning of a file.
16:31  miha: can it appear later? (with included files?)
16:33  Visage: Since it's saved per-file, yes.
16:33  Visage: miha, There are probably scripts to remove it from multiple files.
16:34  Visage: I'm sure it could be done with a server-side language, or even a shell script if you're so inclined.
16:35  miha: Visage well i'll write java program i guess to actually SEE it :)
16:37  Visage: <Visage> You don't need to see it. Just resave your documents with no BOM and you'll be fine.

16:55  miha: visage but now i checked all .php files and it's not in any of it, just in resulting html :) database?
16:56  Visage: miha, A database is not a document. Go look through any file that generates output.
17:01  miha: i give up.
17:01  miha: let it be.
17:01  miha: i just checked all .php source files and there's no such char
17:01  miha: but it appears in generated html

18:20  SpinachHead: is it still recommended to close singles tags like <input     />   in html 5?
18:23  riven: SpinachHead: "still"?
18:26  SpinachHead: it looks like they are called void element and they are not necessary in html5 but only for xhtml.   I don't know, I never liked having to close them anyway
18:26  riven: SpinachHead: I'm still not sure what you mean by "still".
18:26  riven: It was never valid in HTML, let alone *recommended*.
18:27  shiftingcontrol: http://paste.enzotools.org/show/1388/ i dont knw what is wrong with this table
18:27  SpinachHead: Hmm, I didn't know that, but I was always using <br /> and such because some of the books have it that way.
18:27  riven: SpinachHead: 99.9% of all books on HTML suck smelly donkey balls.
18:28  SpinachHead: font tags and no quotes
18:30  shiftingcontrol: SpinachHead:yu mean font tag should ve quote for color ?
18:30  SpinachHead: I was just surprised it had <font> tags in it and no quotes for any of the attributes but one -- just quick look
18:31  Pilum: I am surprised you have font tags at all.
18:31  Pilum: They were replaced in 1996 already.
18:31  SpinachHead: well, at least it will work with Navigator
18:32  Pilum: So will the more modern tags.
18:33  SpinachHead: There's a <center> tag in that table too
18:33 * Pilum cringes.
18:34  SpinachHead: I am going to install that wikileaks guys's surfraw debian package  -- I think it eliminates html altogether
18:35  SpinachHead: I think we should go back to just having one long page that tells you to please be patient while all the images load, that would make things simpler
18:38  Visage: Yeah, or you could join the rest of us in 2010. :)
18:38  SpinachHead: I miss my framess page with blinking navigation gifs
18:39  SpinachHead: I thought it was looking slick once I get rid of the frame scroll bars

19:08  SpinachHead: colored scroll bars
19:24  Visage: SpinachHead, There are some things that died that we should never discuss again. Colored scrollbars being one of them. :)
19:24  Pilum: Did you travel here from 1996 recently, SpinachHead? Stole a time machine perhaps?
19:29  Visage: Did I loan mine out again?
19:29  Visage: I should really quit doing that.

20:58  kaylee_work: hey, can I put an alt type hover explanation on a span? or do I have to put another tag around my text?
21:02  Visage: kaylee_work, It's not the job of alt to make a "hover" anyway. You want the title attribute.
21:03  kaylee_work: ah... THAT would explain why I wasn't finding what I thought I was looking for
21:03  kaylee_work: thanks!
21:03  kaylee_work: *sigh*... It's thursday and I still don't think I've fully recovered from the long weekend
21:04  kaylee_work: I did at least know it was a stupid question
21:04  CoJaBo: Got a $110 fine for going 50mph, 50ft inside a 35mph zone.. wat
21:04  ZombieLoffe: deserved
21:05  Visage: CoJaBo, Nobody cares. :)
21:05  Visage: I'll add that to your list of failures.
21:05 * kaylee_work points and laughs at CoJaBo
21:05  kaylee_work: thanks, now I don't feel as dumb
21:05  CoJaBo: lol
21:05  Visage: CoJaBo fails daily.
21:05  CoJaBo: kaylee_work: Glad I could help =D
21:05  CoJaBo: The Daily Fail.
21:06  CoJaBo: Cathy.
21:06  CoJaBo: Catchy, even.
21:07  kaylee_work: I remember on time I got pulled over going about 80 up a steep hill that was posted 30mph
21:07  kaylee_work: of course I got pulled over
21:07  kaylee_work: I told the cop (in the most innocent voice I could muster) "really? I didn't know this old thing could go that fast up hill"
21:08  CoJaBo: lol
21:08  kaylee_work: he looks at me, looks toward the front of the car (383 stroker, still running) ... looks back at me and says "Riiiiight"
21:08  CoJaBo: xDD
21:08  kaylee_work: amazingly enough I didn't get a speeding ticket
21:08  kaylee_work: I guess I made him laugh inside
21:10  CoJaBo: The only other time I ever even got pulled over, I was going 62 in a 25mph zone. I have no idea how I didnt get a ticket that time o_O
21:11  kaylee_work: oh, and then there was the time I got pulled over driving my beat to crap 85 suburban with no hood on (we'd just done an engine/transmission replacement)
21:11  kaylee_work: I went to court and tried to argue with the judge that "hot rods drive around without hoods all the time"
21:11  CoJaBo: LOL
21:11  CoJaBo: Did it work?
21:12  kaylee_work: can't remember
21:12  kaylee_work: don't think so
21:12  CoJaBo: Id contest this one, but I think I'd just be wasting my time :/
