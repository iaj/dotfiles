22:51  hydrozen: Hi there. I don't want to start a huge debate, but is it still recommended to only have one h1 per page (which pretty much is the title of the page) and thus changes from page to page (so its not just the name of the website on every page)?

23:12  boogyman: Visage: bad noticing :P but yea.... he's definitely hung onto some animosity
23:13  Visage: :)

23:40  aarcane_: anyone know a quick, efficient way to split a single html file into a bunch of smaller html files at certain tags ?
23:40  boogyman: aarcane_: eh?
23:41  aarcane_: it's got h1, h2, and a few h3.  I want to break it into individual files at the h1 and h2 tags.
23:41  aarcane_: plan B is to write a quick PHP file to do it for me, but I'm hoping there's an efficient plan A.
