12:45  PooBakery: Hi... I have to develop something for IE7... now, there seems to be a bug that only registers events in elements that have a background assigned.. would you know of any good solution for this? I cannot have the element colored. do I have to use a transparent image as background?
12:47  ZombieLoffe: Events such as, PooBakery?
12:53  PooBakery: mousemove, mouseover etc
12:53  PooBakery: I fixed it with a transparent background image.. I won't invest any more time in supporting shitty IE.. ;)
12:54  ZombieLoffe: Could be a hasLayout thing. Try adding zoom: 1; to the element to see if giving it layout affects it.
12:54  ZombieLoffe: Using CSS, that is.
12:58  hariom: I have a select dropdown and below it I have a input text field. I want to keep the width of both the elements same so they appear of the same width on the screen. How to get it? input type takes size and select takes width.
12:59  riven: hariom: as the channel topic says, #css for styling
13:45  hariom: I want to show two table records side by side. Both the tables are inside a div. Table1 shows the tabular data and its related table Table2 shows the tabular data of an experiment. But, when I draw I see that Table2 is not inline with Table1. Table2 has shifted down. Why is it so?
13:46  hariom: And how to overcome this?
13:47 --- Azure|dc is now known as Azure
13:52  ZombieLoffe: hariom: tables will break line by default. floating the first to the left would be the easiest way to get them side by side.

14:04  riven: hariom: I've asked you to keep styling -related questions in #css, so let's start paying attention to that now, okay?
14:44  ghr: Does anyone know a website to check for well formed tags but not validate?
14:45  Visage: ghr, What do you have against using the official validator?
14:46  ghr: visage, i don't want to actually validate the html as such
14:47  ghr: visage I'm using a rich text editor but I think using a Ruby on Rails 'summarize' method is snipping the text before the end of a tag
14:47  ghr: so its leaving <strong> tags open and making everything bold!
14:47  ghr: the official one validates things like alt attributes and other stuff that gets in the way
14:50  farhad2010:  i need two list box,one for countries and another for cities?i could not find any ready source code in google :(
14:53  Visage: farhad2010, Uh, so make your own?
14:54  farhad2010: :( it is not so hard but ...
15:56  jomofcw: Hi there :) !
15:57  jomofcw: I ask here few days ago, if the element BASE is always OK. It seems not :/ using it doens't apply :/.
15:58  Visage: jomofcw, I answered before that it is okay to use. What do you mean "it doesn't always apply?"
15:59  jomofcw: Visage hey :D ! Hi ^^ !
15:59  jomofcw: that's my short example : http://pastebin.com/U2eMkRgt
15:59  jomofcw: it doesn't take the right path for my script calling
16:01  jomofcw: perhaps I miss something... add the domain perhaps ?
16:02  Visage: First off, <base> must be an absolute url.
16:02  Visage: http://domain.com/resource/
16:03  jomofcw: hm OK
16:03  Visage: On another note, your doctype is wrong. :)
16:03  Visage: `doctype
16:03  rivvles: The list of W3C doctypes can be found here: http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html - HTML 4.01 Strict or HTML 5 is recommended.
16:03  Visage: ^^ Use one of those two.
16:08  jomofcw: Visage OK, you're right twice. I have better to use html5 instead of xhtml
16:08  jomofcw: I could use HTML 5 ?
16:10  jomofcw: Chiotte ils ont modéré ma fiche :x
16:10  jomofcw: wrong channel :D hope you enjoy french ^^
16:13  jomofcw: Visage I have a question... in your opinion, is it better to use BASE element, or to rewrite each path in page with server side script like PHP ?
16:16  riven: eww, french
16:18  jomofcw: riven Hi ^^ sorry if you're affraid :x
16:31  Visage: riven, Lalz.
16:32  Visage: jomofcw, base just helps to resolve the full path of relative URLs, so you would use it if you have many such URLs with a common base path.
16:33 * Pilum uses relative urls 99.9% of the time.
16:34  jomofcw: Visage OK thanks :D
16:34  jomofcw: Pilum me too ^^
16:36  Visage: Well, if they're resources on your own server, there's no reason not to. :)
16:36  jomofcw: yep !
16:53  alaing: hi i have a img with an onclick it works in ie7 and ff but not in ie6. any ideas why?
16:55  Pilum: Becayse IE6 is a dead browser. Don't practice necromancy.
16:55 * alaing hates having to support ie6
16:57  Visage: Pilum, I'm going to start saying that now. :)
16:58  Pilum: :-)

18:23  antlong: would anyone happen to know how to make a selector that will match something inside of a @style attribute? im trying to match the value of url, inside of @style, http://d.pr/1PCU
18:25  Visage: antlong, selectors are a #css thing, not #html.
