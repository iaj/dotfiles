15:05  ner0x: Anyone notice weird lines next to their images in the newer version of firefox?
15:12  riven: Teratogen: #css for styling.
15:29  Teratogen: riven, I am so banned there
15:29  Teratogen: just because I said "tables>css"
15:29  Teratogen: they sure are touchy in there
15:29  riven: Yes, you've brought that up before. We don't care.
15:29  Visage: Heh.
15:30  riven: zup Visage
15:30  Visage: Ohai riven.
15:31  Teratogen: you don't care!  you NEVER cared!
15:31  Teratogen: *wail*
15:31  Teratogen: =~(
15:31  Visage: Teratogen, Not our fault you got banned in #css, but that still doesn't mean you can ask presentational questions here and expect an answer.

16:14  Loneclock: if i copy the html code on this site, http://www.goalgetters.com/, and paste it into notepad, then save it as a .html, and open it up....its looks different...why?
16:15  rkp: Loneclock, probably left out the css and js files
16:15  rkp: and images
16:15  rkp: :)
16:18  Loneclock: i have to save all of them too rkp?
16:18  Loneclock: also, how can I find and replace all of a word in notepad?
16:19  Loneclock: nvm i found out how to replace
16:22  Visage: Loneclock, also, use Notepad++. Notepad sucks donkey balls.
16:23  riven: Whether or not that's a bad thing depends on your sexual preferences.
16:23  Visage: riven, winfags unite, rite? :)
16:23  riven: :o
16:25  Loneclock: visage i am using notepad++ lol
16:25  Visage: Are you?
16:26  Visage: Are you, REALLY?
16:26  Loneclock: should I save all the sutff in the same place?
16:26  Visage: It might help. :)
16:26  Loneclock: just make a folder called "practice website" then save all the stuff in it?
16:27  Visage: Well, you have to keep the structure that the site has. So if they serve css files from a /css dir, then your local copy needs to reflect that as well.
16:27  Visage: Also, if you're doing all this manually, you're doing it wrong. :)
16:27  Visage: Especially with tools like wget and family out there.
16:29  Loneclock: basically what I want to do is copy the template of a site I like then edit it the way I want
16:30  Visage: Good artists copy, great artists steal. :)
16:30  Visage: Or some such quote. Heh.
16:31  Loneclock: haha well, i am just doing it to learn since its easier than learning all HTML and CSS etc, although I will do that piece by piece too
16:31  Visage: Loneclock, Nothing beats learning HTML and CSS yourself.
16:31  Visage: `schools
16:31  rivvles: Explore the intricacies of HTML and CSS here: http://wsc.opera.com/, www.htmlhelp.com/, http://css-discuss.incutio.com/, www.brainjar.com/, www.htmldog.com/, http://css.maxdesign.com.au/
16:32  Visage: You should read through those.
16:32  Loneclock: yes I know lol but right now I just want to take a site and edit it the way I like lol
16:33  Visage: Okay lol. :)
16:33  Loneclock: wget is just for linux?
16:33  Visage: I still don't think that will really teach you anything though.
16:33  Visage: No, wget is for windows too.
16:35  Loneclock: which one is it?
16:35  Loneclock: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/
16:36  Visage: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm

21:00  Sagiftw: hi, where can i find a script that allows me to upload files to my website?
21:01 --- Channel #html was synced in 122 seconds
21:01  Visage: Sagiftw, You'll have to learn a server-side language for that.
21:02  Sagiftw: Visage: Is that really necessary? I just want to get a script...
21:04  Visage: Sagiftw, You're asking in the wrong place, at any rate. Pick a server-side language and ask in that channel.
21:05  Sagiftw: Visage: Is SQL good for that?
21:05  Visage: Uh, SQL is a database language. You need a language that can run SQL commands and talk to a db.
21:06  Sagiftw: Visage: Can you give me an example, please?
21:06  Visage: One of php, perl, python, ruby, asp.net, etc.
21:06  Visage: Those are the most popular.
21:06  ZombieLoffe: PHP is very widely available. If you're paying for webspace, chances are high it supports PHP.
21:07  Sagiftw: Ok, thanks!
21:07  Visage: And it better. Heh.
