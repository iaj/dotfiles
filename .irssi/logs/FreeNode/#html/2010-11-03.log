14:29 --- Channel #html was synced in 2 seconds
14:29  iaj: lo there
14:29  iaj: is there someone experienced with htmltidy?
14:30  Visage: iaj, This channel is for HTML, as in the language itself, not really for "tools that fix up HTML."
14:30  Visage: Also, don't ask to ask, just ask.
14:33  iaj: Visage: yeah I see.. I know that - I just didn't know where else to ask
14:43  iaj: just trying to figure out how it automatically places the charset=utf8 within the header
14:49  ormaaj: Tidy has a ridiculous number of features these days that I'd never want to remember
14:49  ormaaj: go into vim, gg=G... all you need to know
14:50  ormaaj: some people set it to run with :make I guess.
14:53  Visage: Hehe.
14:55  Visage: ormaaj, Make $ fast! vim: 22i$<esc>. Done. :)
14:55  Visage: vi/vim jokes are great and nobody gets them.
14:55  ormaaj: :)
14:58  Visage: "Pets can die, women can fuck you over, but vim's love is pure."
15:00  Visage: And all the winfags are saying "wut?" :)
15:00  Visage: Okay, back to work.
15:01  ormaaj: I like this one for it's truthiness http://urban.homelinux.org/wp-content/vim_learning.jpg
15:01  Visage: Nice. :)
15:02  Visage: And all true.
15:09  riven: Visage: hey, go die.
15:09  riven: :)
15:11  Visage: riven, nou
15:12  ormaaj: riven: belongs to the church of winodws, or of emacs?
15:12 +[wito]: Holy split, batman!
15:13  riven: [wito]: that wasn't a big one, dummy.
15:13  riven: ormaaj: WINDOOOZ FOHEVAAAAH BROO.
15:13 +[wito]: riven: LOLWINFAG
15:14  Visage: I'm going to agree with wito on this one.
15:14  ormaaj: nobody uses vim on windows native hehe... though I do over putty all the time if I have to.
15:14 --- ChanServ sets modes [#html -v [wito]]
15:14  Visage: ormaaj, windows did get gvim and yeah, putty.
15:14  Visage: But still. :)
15:14  riven: ormaaj: gvim :o
15:14  Visage: I'm willing to bet no winfags use it.
15:15  riven: I tried it and then I was liek, k, I'm not a masochist.
15:15  Visage: amirite riven? You like scrotepad, yeah?
15:15  riven: (inbe4, but you use windows)
15:15  riven: lol Visage.
15:15  Visage: :)
15:16  riven: not rele.
15:16  Visage: Lies.
15:17  ormaaj: I am slightly jealous of nxml/nxhtml mode though. We still get zencoding to compensate
15:17  riven: E2 with native Zen coding = <333333
15:18  riven: `ul.foo.bar[data-lol="wut"]>li*5>a[href=""]`, hit ctrl+e, ????, profit!
15:19  Visage: Oh shi~~
15:23  riven: Yeah, that shut you up, didn't it?!
15:24  Visage: riven, I know your secret now. You got nothin'!
15:24  riven: lol
15:25  GarethAdams|Work: I installed the Zen textmate plugin, then completely forgot it was installed
15:25  riven: heh
15:25  ormaaj: Yeah I actually use surround much more than zencoding tbh
15:25  GarethAdams|Work: the href=""
15:26  GarethAdams|Work: uh
15:26  ormaaj: and supertab
15:26  GarethAdams|Work: the [href=""] is redundant btw
15:26  riven: yeah yeah :p
15:34  ormaaj: heh, even this ie9 running in vbox claims to be still in standards mode when feeding it XML with no doctype.
15:34  Visage: Heh.
15:34  riven: ..
15:35  [wito]: ormaaj: There really doesn't exist a single doctype for XML, nor does there exist a quirks mode for XML, generally speaking
15:35  riven: Not just generally speaking -- Quirks mode is HTML-only.
15:35  ormaaj: that makes sense.
15:36  [wito]: Well, Quirks Mode HTML also gets Quirks Mode CSS
15:36  [wito]: to some degree
15:37  riven: Okay, rephrase... Quirks mode only applies to HTML documents. :)
15:37  [wito]: Thank you.
15:37  ormaaj: in html5 they say it's "optional". They should just recommend against declaring a doctype if no browser which actually supports XML requires one since if you try validating it will of course fail if the validator expects a DTD.
15:38  [wito]: ormaaj: Well, for XHTML1.1 a doctype is generally recommended against.
15:38  ormaaj: unless your document consists of an empty html root node and nothing else
15:39  ormaaj: [wito]: Seriously? That I didn't know.
15:39  [wito]: srsly
15:39  [wito]: it's pretty pointless for XML documents in general.
15:39  riven: XHTML is dead, get over it already.
15:39  [wito]: NEVAH!
15:39  Visage: :)
15:40  riven: doctype in general are pointless -- just a necessary evil for HTML documents.
15:40  riven: Doctypes*
15:40  [wito]: I will fight HTML5 retardarifficness to my dying breath!
15:40  riven: [wito]: hope for you you die soon then, or you will be up for a long fight :)
15:40  [wito]: RAWR
15:40  ormaaj: I actually tried to make a document on my localhost that validates completely in both the XML and XHTML sense if you specify a DTD and schema. and I think it's completely impossible. http://ormaaj.org/
15:40  Visage: riven, since there will be a cult of IE6 followers even in 2050, you can at least let wito have his XHTML.
15:41  riven: heh
15:41  riven: Sure, I'll let [wito] have his unfinished XHTML2. ;)
15:41  [wito]: ormaaj: http://totlandweb.info/reiko
15:42  [wito]: riven: I'll stick to XHTML1.1, thanks.
15:42  riven: Sorry, unfinished and never implemented.
15:42  [wito]: Works perfectly for me. P:
15:42  ormaaj: Seems like a bug in the default attributes in the DTD... coming from xml:space
15:42  [wito]: [MNSFW]
15:43  sjuxax: Hello. I have a table. the tr contains one-too-many-tds, as it were, and the table border rules etc. do not stretch to match in Internet Explorer, though they stretch to match in all other browsers. So the table's outer border is overlapped by the last element. Anyone know how to fix this quickly? I will attach a screenshot
15:44  ormaaj: That'll work except for the XML namespace prefixes I think
15:44  ormaaj: unless the mathml + svg DTD accounts for those
15:44  [wito]: ormaaj: Wut?
15:44  diamonds: can I put a style (background) on the html element?
15:44  [wito]: diamonds: yes
15:44  diamonds: *<html style="foo">
15:44  diamonds: huh ok!
15:45  [wito]: oh, silly me, forgot to remove the DTD from that one at some point
15:45  riven: So much wrong in such a small sentence.
15:46  riven: diamonds: for future reference: 1) read channel topic, which says #css for styling 2) TIAS: try it and see, 3) consult the spec to see if it's valid or 4) consult the validator to see if it's valid
15:46  [wito]: ormaaj: reiko is valid XHTML+MathML+SVG
15:46  ormaaj: [wito]: Like in mine for instance I had to fake the namespaces by adding an internal definition for them as default attributes. Apparently the w3c validator is still a DTD validator but hacks around the problem by hiding such errors.
15:46  diamonds: riven: ty.  But I was afraid if I asked in CSS they would point out that html validation is not a css question.
15:47  diamonds: but I'll try the validator!
15:47  [wito]: ormaaj: Yeah, probably.
15:47  riven: diamonds: ah, thought you wanted to know if you could style the HTML element -- okay, fine, that still leaves 2, 3 and 4 :p
15:47  diamonds: riven: for 2 I know it works, I'm trying to find out if it's kosher :p
15:48  diamonds: so just 3 and 4!!
15:48  riven: ZOMG.
15:48 * diamonds batting .500
15:48  diamonds: thank you
15:48  riven: :)
15:48  [wito]: diamonds: Note that if you put a background on both the body and html elements can lead to unexpected results in some browsers. (Not actually undocumented, I think, just unexpected)
15:48  sjuxax: image at http://i.imgur.com/lwWUk.png
15:48  riven: [wito]: def. documented.
15:49  [wito]: probably, yeah
15:49  riven: No, no "probably" involved :p
15:50  [wito]: Fine.
15:50  riven: <3
15:50  [wito]: It's 100% certain to be fucking document, now shut the fuck up. Scallaway.
15:50  [wito]: *Scallawag.
15:50 * riven blinks
15:51  Visage: Aww, lovers' quarrel. :)
15:51 * [wito] blows a kiss to riven
15:51  riven: I think you mean 'documented', [wito]...
15:51 * riven sighs
15:51  [wito]: derp
15:53  [wito]: http://i39.tinypic.com/fo0irs.jpg << me
15:53  [wito]: apparently
15:54  cardona507: heh
15:55  Visage: You're a hoe? Wut?
15:56  riven: Hey [wito], that's funny... I always imaged you looking like that!
15:56  riven: imagined, too.
15:56  Visage: Haha.
15:56  Visage: A horse with a neckbeard maybe.
15:56  riven: hah
15:56  Visage: Okay, I'm done. :)
15:57  [wito]: http://i53.tinypic.com/2jbr3fl.png << me, actually
15:58  Visage: So you're a fat, communist furry now?
15:58  Visage: I KNEW IT.
15:59  cardona507: epic
16:00  [wito]: Visage: How is any of that news?
16:00  Visage: Heh.
16:04  [wito]: well, except the furry bit
16:05  Visage: Sure wito, sure. :)
16:05  riven: mmmmmm, furries.
16:05  riven: oops, wrong chat! ><
16:08  [wito]: anyway, I'll be taking my leave .
16:08  [wito]: Have a good one
16:08  riven: BI.
16:17  ormaaj: ~/programs/gentoo-x86 $ xmllint --valid --noout --loaddtd http://totlandweb.info/reiko
16:17  ormaaj: http://www.w3.org/2002/04/xhtml-math-svg/xhtml-math-svg-flat.dtd:2633: validity warning : Attribute space of element svg:style: already defined
16:17  ormaaj:     type %ContentType.datatype; #REQUIRED
16:18  ormaaj: lul, not sure what that's about actually :P
16:55  BW^-: how do i make search engines show extra links under matches to my homepage? googling for "wine" shows 8 extra links under winehq.org
16:55  BW^-: should be in some metadata somewhere, no?
16:56  Pilum: #web
16:56  BW^-: ah
16:56  BW^-: thx
16:56  Pilum: Meta is mostly irrelevant.
16:58  Aristata: Have any of you in your development come across a way to do this <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=I AM AUTOPOPULATING A STATus THROUGH THIS LINK"></a> with Facebook?
16:59  Visage: BW^-, You can't control that at all.
16:59  Visage: Google does that as they see fit, and there's nothing you can do in your markup or otherwise to influence that.
17:01  BW^-: visage: really? i can't put any info to modify these "rich snippets" at all?
17:03  ormaaj: BW^-: yeah they should use that data actually afaik
17:04  Visage: BW^-, Not possible.
17:04  ormaaj: http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/topic.py?topic=21997
17:04  ormaaj: http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2008/09/searchmonkey_support_for_rdfa_enabled/
17:05  ormaaj: http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/smguide/semantic_web.html
17:06  BW^-: visage: is there any way to hint search engines about that should produce such a menu, and what it should contain?
17:07  ormaaj: unless google has stopped parsing that stuff
17:08  Puck`: hi everyone
17:08  BW^-: ormaaj: how can you put this kind of menu info into that data?
17:08  BW^-: i don't find it, i only find values for bolding text, geographic location, that kind of thing
17:09  BW^-: ormaaj: are you aware of any metadata value we could influence it via+
17:09  BW^-: ormaaj: what visage says, this page says also. http://www.googlecommunity.com/forum/all-about-google/31767-how-add-menu-google-search-result.html
17:09  BW^-: = you can't specify it
17:11  ormaaj: BW^-: I think it's impossible to directly control what they do, there might be other factors that influence how much data they show (like how popular your site is). I just know that if you use various RDF or microformats vocabularies they can use that to add more info to search results.
17:11  Puck`: is there a way to input a blank line in a table between two <tr>'s? I hope there's a way other than closing the <table> and re-opening it after the line I want to input
17:12  BW^-: ormaaj: ah ok.
17:12  BW^-: thanks for letting me know guys! was curious. :-)
17:14  ormaaj: BW^-: see they do explain the exact properties they support but also they don't necessarily say "yes we will definitely add this to every search result for your site" http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170
17:16  BW^-: ormaaj: i see this page, but i see nowhere there any way to insert rich snippet info that could lead to a menu
17:16  BW^-: the page i'm working with is a company page, they have a login, a prices, a contact, an about page, that would all do a good job being shown under the main domain name in google searches
17:16  ormaaj: Yeah I thought you could... i've been looking around these pages for that
17:17  BW^-: that page lists reviews, people, organizations, events and recipes, we qualify for neither of that. :)
17:25  ormaaj: BW^-: On the wine page, the downloads and wiki are linked to, and both contain <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">, whereas the forums are not linked to, and it doesn't have a robots meta tag.
17:25  ormaaj: could be coincidence of course
17:34  ormaaj: Apparently you can tell googlebot to explicitly not use snippets.
17:48  ormaaj: lel http://bnode.org/media/2009/07/08/semantic_web_technology_stack.png
17:57  FireSlash: Is there any tag I can use that an in-page search from, say, firefox would pick up, but doesn't affect the overall layout or look of the page?
17:57  riven: wut
17:57  FireSlash: for instance on this page: http://mk3.tf2stats.net/hats/ so someone could ctrl+f search for the name of an item
17:57  FireSlash: which otherwise isn't visible unless they mouse over the item name itself
17:58  ormaaj: that searches for stuff that's visible, not tags
17:59  ormaaj: What's wrong with using ids?
17:59  FireSlash: ?
17:59  ormaaj: Just jump to a spot on the page via a tag's id rather than searching
18:00  FireSlash: I don't want to add any more to the page's veritcal layout. Adding jumps would require a section at the top with a list of items.
18:00  FireSlash: which only would serve to make the page even taller, and obscure the useful content of the page
18:01  zok: How can I make it so that when someone clicks on the text next to a checkbox, it checks the checkbox?
18:01  FireSlash: zok, check out the <label> tag
18:04  ormaaj: You don't technically need an index I suppose, though you'd have to look in the source if you didn't have them. ids are the correct method for uniquely navigating to specific places on a page. If you wanted some specific search function you'd probably be better off implementing it yourself in JS than relying on a browser feature.
18:04  ormaaj: That way it would be universally accessable and have consistent behavior across browsers too
18:05  ormaaj: adding one little field to that page would probably be okay
18:06  zok: FireSlash: that didn't seem to work... maybe I'm doing something wrong...
18:06 * zok fires up pastebin
18:07  FireSlash: ormaaj, yeah, that might work. jquery.scrollTo and a little box.
18:07  ormaaj: <3 TF2
18:07  zok: FireSlash: http://pastebin.com/bEfXc3fr
18:08  Visage: zok, <label>, not <lable>. :)
18:09  FireSlash: yeah, correct the minor errors and it works for me.
18:09 * zok facepalms
18:09  zok: Thanks :)
18:09  Visage: Hehe.
18:10  ormaaj: FireSlash: I love that theme
18:10  FireSlash: ormaaj, ormaaj I can't take credit for the design
18:11  FireSlash: I just did all the coding
18:11  FireSlash: Well, I suppose i really did everything BUT the theme. But whatever
18:11  FireSlash: http://tf2stats.net/ <-- This is what it looks like when I do my own site styles :P
18:12  ormaaj: Ah well I was about to say the rest totally sucks but now I won't
18:13  ormaaj: + winking smiley
18:14  FireSlash: well much of the site is still a WIP
