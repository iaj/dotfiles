16:57  MonsterKiller: Hey. on a selection box i have onChange="CodePasteVisChange()" to run a javascript function but it doesnt seem to run it when i change the value
16:57  MonsterKiller: am i doing it wrong?
16:58  Pilum: 1) Event handlers are not camelCased, 2) ##javascript.
16:58  MonsterKiller: been to #javascript and the java side seems fine. Its just doesnt seem to be run when i change it.
17:00  MonsterKiller: erm. well onchange seems to work for alert('blah') so maybe the hmtl is fine :s
17:00  Pilum: The event handler itself is script-related too.
17:01  Pilum: Also, language="text/javascript" is wrong. It's type="text/javascript"
17:02  MonsterKiller: ahhhh
17:02  MonsterKiller: :D
17:02  MonsterKiller: my bad
17:02  MonsterKiller: thanks
17:04  Visage: And even that's unnecessary in HTML 5.

17:15  complete: Hey People! Is it save to have a hidden field in a form like <input type=hidden name=url value="http://www.host.com/some_url?some=thing"> ? Or do you have to urlencode the value?
17:16  Pilum: The browser takes care of that for you.
17:17  complete: ok, so no encoding. encoding would result in double encoding otherwise, right?
17:28  Pilum: Right.
17:42  complete: ok

18:14  dmfg__883: Hello. I'm learning HTML by trying to reverse engineer some simple web pages I've found. I'm doing this by commenting out everything, then uncommenting a piece at a time until i understand each piece.
18:15  dmfg__883: from the simple pages i'm looking at, it appears an HTML page and it's associated CSS file are linked by a line like the followng:
18:15  dmfg__883: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="variant-stream.css" title="Variant Stream" media="screen,projection" />
18:16  dmfg__883: that line alone seems to generate the colorful background, and the side bar's background color, and the title areas background color
18:16  Pilum: Generally, considering the quality of most sites, learning by reverse-engineering will teach you bad habits.
18:16  Pilum: As for linking CSS files, yes, that's correct.
18:16  Pilum: As for learning,
18:16  Pilum: ]schools

18:17  dmfg__883: Pilum, thanks
18:17  dmfg__883: so is the role of HTML essentially to produce and format all the text on a web page? and CSS handles all the stuff the text sits on top of?
18:18  Pilum: No.
18:18  Pilum: HTML has nothing to do with formatting.
18:18  Pilum: HTML produces the semantic structure; it describes the content.
18:21  dmfg__883: Okay. Glancing at the HTML sheet I see various sections (e.g., <content>) and then in the CSS file I see it referencing "#content". So the HTML file describes the semantic structure of the <content> section, and then CSS tells what to do with it visually?
18:22  Sefyroth: dmfg__883: Basically, yes.
18:22  Sefyroth: dmfg__883: But you probably mean <div id="content">
18:22  Sefyroth: Because <content> is  not a valid element.
18:23  dmfg__883: Sefyroth, oh right, yeah thats what i meant
18:23  dmfg__883: ok, thanks
18:48  joseph: I have a <table> set at a specified width. The <th> tags in the table go out to that width, but the <td> tags do not.
18:48  joseph: What's the best way to make sure that the width is consistent?
18:50  Pilum: Don't use tables for layout.
18:51  maxzoil: hy all..how to get ifframe title and url ??
18:51  Pilum: Don't cross-post.
18:52  joseph: Pilum: I'm not using tables for layout. It's tabular data.
18:53  Pilum: Then you want #css
19:00  Shishire: ok, I've been pouring over the specs, and I can't find the answer. http://www.webdevout.net/test?01j  <-- Is that valid?  It validates, but is it legal within the specs?
19:00  thevishy: CGI is still used ? Does usual LAMP using CGI for web apps
19:00  Pilum: thevishy: #web
19:01  thevishy: thanks #web seems to be for mobile web development
19:02  thevishy: sorry , I think I got it wrong will check there
19:02  Pilum: Heh no. It's for general web stuff.
19:03  Pilum: #httpd might offer some insight too
19:03  thevishy: right
19:14  MatthewG: thevishy: #mobile-webdev , actually :)
19:14  MatthewG: thevishy: (it's in the topic in #web , fwiw)
19:18  eoss: hey why is my site resolving to searchmagnified.com?
19:18  Sefyroth: lol h4x0rd
19:18  eoss: it was fine last night
19:18  eoss: my server or my computer?
19:19  Pilum: What's that got to do with HTML?
19:28  Pupeno[work]: Is there a way to hide elements in a select? A whole optgroup perhaps?
19:31  Shishire: Pupeno[work], I'm assuming you want something more complicated than just commenting it out?
19:34  Pupeno[work]: Shishire: yes, I want to hide it at runtime, with javascript.
19:38  Shishire: Pupeno[work], belongs in #javascript, but remove() on the select element would take things out
19:41  Pupeno[work]: Shishire: well, technically, I think it would be CSS, but I'm not sure.
19:46  Shishire: Pupeno[work], you can't remove/hide options from a select box with css.  Javascript can only remove/add/disable them.  In HTML you would at best be able to set them to disabled.
19:47  Shishire: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/optgroup#attr-disabled
19:51  Pupeno[work]: ok, thanks.
