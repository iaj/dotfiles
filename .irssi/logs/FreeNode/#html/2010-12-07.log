01:00  oojacoboo: <option selected> how's support for this?
01:01  oojacoboo: I forget... does IE need selected="selected" ?
01:02  boogyman: oojacoboo: that's doctype specific, XHTML the latter, HTML the former
01:03  oojacoboo: gotcha
01:03  oojacoboo: boogyman: do you know if you can do hierarchical option elements or if you just use styling to make them appear so?
01:04  oojacoboo: I know about <optgroup>, but I would need that element to be selectable as an option as well

15:34  dmcdaniel12: I have a table, I want JUST the table header to be underlined, was the best way to do that? I tried <th border='1'> but that didn't work
15:35  Visage: dmcdaniel12, #css for styling issues.
15:36  dmcdaniel12: Okay thanks

17:27  Pilum: Firefox reads &sid= too
17:27  Arimil: T_T its because I'm logged in and taht one is valid
17:27  Arimil: logout shows correctly, login doesn't
17:29  Arimil: Ugh, that's on the sidebar I hid with css too...

18:01  [Visage]: Arimil, As soon as you can, switch to a less fail CMS. :)
18:01  [Visage]: But for now, yay, I suppose.
18:01  [Visage]: Enchilada, I see no HTML question.
18:02  Enchilada: I know, sorry :S
18:02  Enchilada: it's the first channel i could think of
18:03  Pilum: Think of #web next time
18:05  Enchilada: thanks sir
18:05  Enchilada: will do
18:11  Arimil: [Visage]: first time using a cms lol
18:17  [Visage]: Arimil, MODx > *
18:18  Arimil: I hated the idea of wordpress for the longest time but I finally got around to screwing it up and using it in a way it wans't intended so that it suits my needs lol.
18:24  [Visage]: Arimil, I think everybody does that with Turdpress.
18:55  AdvoWork: should all html pages have a mime type?
18:56  [Visage]: AdvoWork, If you don't send it yourself, the web server usually will.
18:56  [Visage]: And no, http-equiv stuff is useless in this case.
18:59  Arimil: [Visage]:modx is definatly more win, however from what I can tell it's a lot more work to get a more polished version of what I already have
19:00  [Visage]: Arimil, Perhaps, but the end reward will be worth it. :)
19:00  Arimil: If I could go back to before I set up wordpress and spent so much time changing it already I would defiantly go with modx first.
19:00  Arimil: But it's to much work for no real benefit atm.
19:00  [Visage]: Arimil, Well anyway, keep it in mind for future projects at least.
19:00  Arimil: will do
19:01  Arimil: Then again my current setup really isn't all that stable haha... it's a bunch of plugins and mods that suprisingly didn't have to many issues with eachother.
19:01  Arimil: How long that will last however I'm unsure.
19:01  [Visage]: Hehe.
19:02  Arimil: Theres still a lot of things I would like to add, openid... etc.
19:04  [Visage]: Indeed.
19:05  [Visage]: OpenID or Facebook Connect or some other universal login system is the way to go these days.
19:05  Arimil: Yeah, registration pages suck. I hate them and I don't wnat to subject people that visit my site to them.
19:06  Arimil: makes it less accessable
19:06  [Visage]: Yup. :)
19:07  Arimil: I'll probably set up modx on a subdomain and mess around with it to see if I get anywhere.
19:08  [Visage]: Arimil, http://theoatmeal.com/comics/websites_stop <- #4. :)
19:09  Arimil: haha
19:09  [Visage]: The Oatmeal kicks ass.
19:09  Arimil: yeah
19:09  Arimil: I like this one
19:10  Arimil: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/computers
19:10  [Visage]: Yeah...
19:11  [Visage]: "How a web design goes straight to hell" is also true. I've had that happen before with a client.
19:26 --- Azure|dc is now known as Azure
19:39  Arimil: [Visage]: never made websites for anyone but myself but I've seen little instances of things like that
19:39  Arimil: like when the user clicks this button an alert box should pop up to tell them they did it wrong
19:39  Arimil: uh... how about they read the god damn description that tells them how to do it
19:40  Arimil: alert boxes are annoying lol
19:42  [Visage]: Heh, indeed.

23:48  mortal1: howdy folks.  I'm trying to figure out how to write a 'tabbed' interface in html
23:48  mortal1: can anyone point me in a direction?
23:48  Visage: mortal1, That's going to require a combination of CSS and JS, at the very least.
23:48  Visage: It's not something that HTML can handle alone.
23:48  mortal1: :^/ that's about what I figured
23:49 <-- wito has kicked mortal1 from #html (On a related note; It's my birthday and fuck you.)
23:50  mortal1: seriously?
23:50  Visage: mortal1, wito is just being wito. :)
23:50  Visage: mortal1, Anyway, you may want to try asking in #web, since it's really a combination of all three.
23:51 * mortal1 nods
