16:19  Hutch[S]: hey all, can you set a base ref for all img src?
16:19  ZombieLoffe: ]html base @ Hutch[S]
16:19  _ZofBot4: Hutch[S], html base: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#edef-BASE
16:20  Hutch[S]: ZombieLoffe: I believe base only works for a href URLS not img src
16:20  ZombieLoffe: you might be right.
16:20  ZombieLoffe: If so, no.
16:22  Bananobot: base works for img src attributes
16:43  engaged: If I list some professional by city and I paginate should I do domain.com/State/City-Name/1 or domain.com/State/City-Name-1/ and why...?  (for SEO purposes)
16:46  [wito]: engaged: I'd probably go with domain.com/State/City-Name/?page=1
16:47  [wito]: because domain.com/State/City-Name/1 should probably refer to Aaron A. Aaronson, Aardvark Hunter
16:52  engaged: why /?page=1
16:52  engaged: seems like thatd be worse for SEO
16:53  tesseracter: best way to get a checkbox to throw back &foo=True if checked, and nothing or &foo=False if unchecked?
16:54  tesseracter: engaged, didnt hear the question, but the only way you'd want to do that is with a <link ref="canonical"> at the top.
16:54  engaged: tesseracter: here is the question:

16:55 --- sacre2 is now known as sacre3
16:55  GarethAdams|Work: I think that's one of the more pointless things to think about SEO for
16:56  GarethAdams|Work: different professionals will be on different pages at different times
16:56  tesseracter: engaged, make it useful to yourself, SEO won't care.
16:56  tesseracter: sounds like a job for canonical to me.
16:56  GarethAdams|Work: don't you hate when you get a search result pointing to page 7 of a list, and then you look and page 7 is completely different now?
16:57  engaged: what is canonical
16:57  GarethAdams|Work: just make sure the individual professional page is useful and the search engines won't ever direct people to the list page
16:57  tesseracter: engaged, http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139394
16:58  tesseracter: but GarethAdams|Work is more right than i am :-)
16:58  engaged: is that matt cutts
16:59  tesseracter: engaged, looks like it.
17:00  engaged: ughhhh
17:18  sacre3:  
17:18  engaged:
