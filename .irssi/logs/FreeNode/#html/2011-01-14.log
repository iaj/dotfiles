17:11  iaj: hey :)
17:12  iaj: can mb someone tell me which webhosting service is highly recommenadble.. ?  due to speed, reliabilty?
17:13  riven: iaj: off-topic here, maybe try in #web
17:13  iaj: ahw.. sorry riven
17:13  riven: np
17:42  ComradeHaz`: Hi all. Can anyone help me move the page title (ie "THE COTTAGE") down on this page? http://lithitux.org/~haz/ .   Also, I notice the way I have attempted to do this does not pass W3C validation, so please could I also have some assistance with resolving that?
17:44  Visage: ComradeHaz`, first error: <span><h1> is invalid. In HTML 4.01, inline elements cannot contain block elements.
17:47  ComradeHaz`: Aye, Visage, a gentleman over in CSS is telling me the same
17:48  ComradeHaz`: Thanks alot :)
17:50  Visage: And the other can be fixed by quoting your attribute value.
17:50  Visage: But yes, as far as moving the logo down, that's a #css issue.
17:55  ComradeHaz`: http://lithitux.org/~haz/ is what I have now
17:56  ComradeHaz`: clearly rather broken
17:56  ComradeHaz`: Have I missunderstoodified?!
17:58  ComradeHaz`: Oh
17:58  Visage: ComradeHaz`, quote that href value. :)
17:58  ComradeHaz`: Think I see what I should be doing
17:59  ComradeHaz`: http://lithitux.org/~haz/ Should it be like that?
17:59  ComradeHaz`: Obviously need to find a way of pushing title down still
18:00  Visage: ComradeHaz`, As I said, #css for styling issues.
18:01  Visage: I'm just telling you to fix that last validation error.
18:01  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, understood.
18:01  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I'm asking if I have done that right :)
18:02  ComradeHaz`: It validates, which is good, I guess :)
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Though I still have an error I don't fully understand
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Ironically enough to do with the W3C logo :D
18:03  Visage: I told you a few times how to fix that error. :)
18:03  Visage: Quote your attribute value.
18:03  ComradeHaz`: I don;t know what that means
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Oh
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Oh
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Oh
18:03  ComradeHaz`: Oh
18:03  ComradeHaz`: :D
18:04  Visage: You have <a href=http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer>
18:04  Visage: You want <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">
18:04  Visage: See? :)
18:04  Visage: href is an attribute and attribute values should have quotes around them.
18:05  ComradeHaz`: That doesn't help
18:05  ComradeHaz`: Oh
18:05  ComradeHaz`: I am such a fool
18:05  ComradeHaz`: I keep modifying it locally and validating the server version
18:06  Visage: Hehe.
18:06  ComradeHaz`: OK, awesome.
18:06  ComradeHaz`: I guess that just leaves me with css (or rather #css ) issues ;)
18:06  Visage: Yup.
18:10  ComradeHaz`: Thanks Visage, by the way :)
18:11  Visage: You're welcome.
18:22  Ring0`: Hi, can I do custom (image'd) input submit type button BUT without javascript (so it must be type="submit" ?
18:27  Visage: Ring0`, <input type="submit"> and style it with CSS.
18:27  Ring0`: Visage: that's what I tried but browsers auto-add some 'beauties' to them like borders (shaded-like)
18:28  Ring0`: which, hell, I don't need
18:30  Ring0`: Aha, that was just to set border:none >.< I'm so stupid
18:30  Ring0`: I was so sure it's simply unchangeable that I gave up not even trying
18:30  Visage: Heh.
18:31  Visage: Well, now you know. :)
18:31  Ring0`: Well, sorry for useless spam then. Have a nice day.

19:45  ComradeHaz`: Hi all, I think my issue is pure css, if it is, and you are thus unwilling to help, fine, please tell me, but as there is nobody around in #css and it could be an html issue, I will ask anyway...
19:46  ComradeHaz`: What I want is to move text in 3 places, in all cases down, by differing ammounts. They are the title, the left nav bar and the top nav bar (just a few px's here).  I have a horrible feeling this means I need to create new elements within current ones but am a total noob so not really sure.
19:46  ComradeHaz`: Page in question is at http://lithitux.org/~haz/
19:47  Visage: ComradeHaz`, It's still a CSS issue. Hence, #css. :)
19:48  Visage: HTML is about structure, CSS is about presentation.
19:48  ComradeHaz`: Gah :(
19:48  ComradeHaz`: They're all hiding!
19:48  ComradeHaz`: Oh well, dinner time!
19:48  Visage: If #css is busy, then just wait there and have patience.
19:48  ComradeHaz`: thanks anyway :)
19:48  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I know
19:48  ComradeHaz`: Thanks pal :)
21:03  Illusioneer: ok, I am trying to reverse engineer something that got dumped on me at work.  if a <form> has a defined method (POST) but it has no ACTION, it's clearly submitting the entry but where is it going?
21:03  Illusioneer: Is there something I'm missing?
21:05  Visage: Illusioneer, Usually to the current url, however, you shuold specify a value for the action.
21:05  Illusioneer: Ok thanks
21:06  EpiphanyG: does HTML validate if I use form elements without using a <form> tag?
21:07  Visage: EpiphanyG, Validate and see. :)
21:08  EpiphanyG: hehe, it was a mild curiosity :P
21:09  Visage: EpiphanyG, You can, but they can never be successful in life.
21:14  EpiphanyG: ok, thanks :)
