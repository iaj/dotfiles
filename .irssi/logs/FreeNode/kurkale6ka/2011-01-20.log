12:43 iaj: heh
12:44 iaj: Im looking for the hosting service
12:44 iaj: like where can I get a good ssh'able domain
12:48 kurkale6ka: not sure man, not very good at this. I use chatzilla here... as for vim/gvim I use equally both with csapprox for vim
12:49 kurkale6ka: remember the latex discussion... I have a nice setup now, with lots of snippets... using snipMate
12:50 iaj: really?? Heh, nice... but I didn't like snipmate that much I think... something didn't fit me
12:50 iaj: however.. can you share the snips?
12:51 kurkale6ka: snipMate is just amazing, so easy to use... here you go: https://github.com/kurkale6ka/vimfiles/blob/master/snippets/tex.snippets
