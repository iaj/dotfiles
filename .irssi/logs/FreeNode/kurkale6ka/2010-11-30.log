12:28 --- Query: Starting query with kurkale6ka on FreeNode
12:28 iaj: lo there again
12:28 iaj: sorry for bugging
12:28 kurkale6ka: np
12:28 iaj: do you have the tlmgr command on your commandline?
12:29 kurkale6ka: no
12:30 kurkale6ka: what do you wanna do?
12:31 kurkale6ka: oh, it is about latex
12:31 iaj: yeh
12:31 iaj: same like  yesterday
12:31 iaj: sorry -- got a coffee right now
12:31 iaj: that should be included in texlive
12:31 iaj: and a command for adding additional latex packages
12:31 iaj: or how do you usually do that ;)
12:32 kurkale6ka: hmm, looks good, never tryied it though, always had to bug myself when I wanted a certain package
12:32 iaj: bug myself - but you achieved that goal?
12:33 iaj: can't seem to find a working copy of tmlmgr
12:33 kurkale6ka: Yeah, sometimes, I wasn't able for instance to use the eurosans package... :)
12:34 iaj: damn.... i remember such an easy way on windows... where one gets prompted for installing 
12:34 kurkale6ka: there is miktex, never tried but heard good of it
12:37 iaj: heh.... ooh...
12:38 iaj: hm
12:38 kurkale6ka: hmm, centos doesn't have tlmgr in the official repositories...
12:38 iaj: i tried so many things on OSX
12:38 iaj: installed tetex
12:38 iaj: texlive
12:38 iaj: mactex.
12:38 iaj: not included in any of those haah
12:38 iaj: and the space is rising
12:38 kurkale6ka: maybe just try to do things manually
12:38 kurkale6ka: pdflatex should be in textex
12:39 kurkale6ka: tetex
12:39 iaj: yeh I do now
12:40 iaj: problem is I just installed tetex - then texlive -  and now I don't know how to remove all of the stuff I don't need anymore
12:40 kurkale6ka: not sure how you did, here I would do: yum remove tetex...
12:41 kurkale6ka: I have a virtual machine with centos and I also have cygwin installed
12:43 iaj: hmmm yeh I did  sudo port uninstall texlive
12:43 iaj: for eample
12:43 iaj: but all of its dependencies like texlive-common and stuff
12:43 iaj: are still installed and listed under 'port installed'
12:44 kurkale6ka: then, port is not doing its job proberly or maybe you need to tell him more... man port?

12:51 kurkale6ka: personally, I have a ~/texmf folder and this is where I install all new packages
12:51 iaj: ihmmm
12:51 kurkale6ka: this way I can remove everything easylly
12:52 iaj: i took a look into the port thingie.. can't find a log
12:52 iaj: yeah.. and how do you source / add those packages?
12:53 kurkale6ka: it is done automatically because ~/texmf acts a bit like the .vim folder
12:53 kurkale6ka: when I use pdflatec somefile.tex it works
12:54 iaj: oh...
12:54 iaj: i see :)
12:54 iaj: cool
12:54 iaj: and how do you add packages there?
12:54 iaj: just drop them in ~/texmf?
12:54 kurkale6ka: lemme give you an example
12:54 iaj: thanks man :)
12:55 kurkale6ka: for that one... http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/amslatex
12:55 kurkale6ka: ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex/install.txt
12:55 kurkale6ka: look for installing the easy way... string
12:56 kurkale6ka: basically unziped into texmf and it created all needed subdirs
12:57 iaj: oh that's all?
12:57 iaj: i mean.. if I do a pdflatex on a file
12:57 iaj: i will always look into ~/texmf if those packages are installed?
12:57 kurkale6ka: yes, it does it here
12:59 iaj: heh
12:59 iaj: cool :D
12:59 iaj: that would be easy then :\
12:59 kurkale6ka: really easy, so far I have no complaints
12:59 kurkale6ka: a part from eurosans
13:00 iaj: haha... eurosans
13:00 iaj: never heard of that one
13:00 iaj: alright I'll try that one :)
13:01 kurkale6ka: yes I use the greek alphabet to write the euro sign (really ugly)
13:03 iaj: gna... is that such big an issue?
13:03 iaj: weird.
13:04 kurkale6ka: I must say I am not very experienced, just started, still need to read a lot
13:08 iaj: you mean with .tex in general?
13:09 kurkale6ka: yes, I did some in uni but I was a bit of a wanker then... now I am redescovering
13:14 iaj: a wanker.. haha ;-)
13:15 kurkale6ka: sorry, didn't mean to be gross
13:15 iaj: nah no problem

14:58 iaj: would love to use chrome but... its just not so extendable
14:59 kurkale6ka: :)
14:59 kurkale6ka: yes, i will give chrome a try
15:00 iaj: heh... for Webdevelopment I need firebug still
15:00 iaj: too bad
15:01 kurkale6ka: for that, ff is the best... you could use the debug toolbar for ie :)
15:02 iaj: bah..
15:02 iaj: I'd rather become a 
15:02 iaj: wanker!

15:16 iaj: a year now
15:16 iaj: but getting into it just now actually
15:18 kurkale6ka: cool, been using it for 3 years now
15:18 iaj: woah... reallY?
15:18 iaj: nice!!!
15:18 iaj: you must be an awesome vimmer :)
15:19 iaj: im just getting impressed by it more n more each day
15:19 kurkale6ka: I am ok, with Vim you learn all the time
15:21 kurkale6ka: I have a few plugins, some silly as well
15:22 kurkale6ka: fyi: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3255
15:22 kurkale6ka: he he, sorry about that
15:23 iaj: huh
15:23 iaj: what's that :)

15:37 iaj: hmmm...
15:37 iaj: what specifically could that be used for :)
15:39 kurkale6ka: well increment numbers as shown in the examples :) (1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1) -> (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...)
15:39 iaj: ohh :)
15:39 iaj: for testing arrays?
15:42 kurkale6ka: well, general purpose... if you have a lines of repeated numbers, you could create a sequence or add/sustract a number to all of them
15:42 kurkale6ka: a lines -> lines
15:44 iaj: ahhh I got it :)
15:44 iaj: thanks
15:44 iaj: do you have your vimrc shared tw?
15:44 iaj: s/tw/btw
15:45 kurkale6ka: hmm, :), if you are interested, have a look in here: https://github.com/kurkale6ka/vimfiles
15:47 iaj: weeeh
15:47 iaj: gonna check one sec :)
15:47 iaj: thank
15:47 iaj: you sir!
15:47 kurkale6ka: my pleasure he he
15:48 iaj: wow large vimrc:)
15:49 kurkale6ka: And I have tried to keep it as small as possible
15:50 iaj: im wondering
15:50 iaj: you use pathogen
15:50 iaj: but not using the bundle structure?
15:50 kurkale6ka: I do in fact
15:51 iaj: huh?
15:51 kurkale6ka: but this bit I don't version, maybe I should
15:51 iaj: I can't find .vim/bundle
15:51 iaj: heh
15:51 iaj: ahhh I see
15:51 iaj: :-)
15:52 iaj: haha your latex script :)
15:52 iaj: couldn't you have used a snippet enginge as well?
15:52 iaj: engine * sorry
15:52 kurkale6ka: he he I just started a few days ago :)
15:53 iaj: heh :)))
15:53 iaj: use XPT
15:53 iaj: !
15:53 kurkale6ka: may be yes but I tried a few and didn't really understand them or see the benefit
15:53 kurkale6ka: ok, will try
15:54 iaj: its kind a steep learning curve.. but i don't wanna miss it!
15:55 kurkale6ka: but it is of general use right, not only latex... I think I have tried it quickly in the past. Any good for Latex?
15:58 kurkale6ka: I actually use the textmate plugin, it may have some snippets for latex, hmm
16:00 iaj: i think latex is provided as well
16:00 iaj: the latex suite sucks so
16:00 iaj: but you'd have need to define your personal snippets
16:00 iaj: which isn't to hard
16:00 iaj: but once you got them set up
16:00 iaj: it rocks :O))
16:01 kurkale6ka: cool, I will have a go
16:01 iaj: yeh me as well
16:02 iaj: maybe we can share some good snippets together :)
16:02 kurkale6ka: of course
16:02 kurkale6ka: my repo is public anyway :)
16:02 iaj: just because github is too expensive :D
16:03 kurkale6ka: yeah, I just use a free acount
16:03 kurkale6ka: btw, I meant that I would try it when I said I will have a go. Otherwise I am here the afternoon
16:03 iaj: same here... well not really used so far
16:04 iaj: need to get into git as well :\
16:04 kurkale6ka: :\ I know just enough
16:05 iaj: like which commands?
16:05 iaj: heh
16:05 kurkale6ka: pull and push :)
16:05 iaj: :D :D
16:05 iaj: git add and git rm :)
16:05 iaj: that git add origin stuff
16:05 iaj: throttles me
16:05 kurkale6ka: that too
16:08 iaj: hmm
16:08 iaj: which languages do you code in?
16:09 kurkale6ka: only english
16:09 iaj: lol
16:09 iaj: i ment programming languages

16:11 iaj: well... TRYING to do java coding with vim
16:11 iaj: but java is a pain in java
16:11 iaj: haha
16:11 iaj: bit php/javascript
16:12 iaj: not so much programming lately
16:12 iaj: my bachelor thesis is java... but I'm avoiding it so far :(
16:13 kurkale6ka: hmmm I have done java nad I don't like it, I love stuff like perl, python, ruby
16:13 iaj: python,ruby I'd love to get a pro in that
16:14 kurkale6ka: I am doing some ruby right now (cucumber)
16:14 iaj: can you guide me some good books btw?
16:15 kurkale6ka: I think the best is to learn online, many, many sites out there
16:16 iaj: yey.. but I can learn better from books
16:16 iaj: that's my grudge
16:16 iaj: hah
16:16 kurkale6ka: usually me too, except for programming
16:17 iaj: something in particular?
16:17 iaj: did you do python?
16:17 kurkale6ka: just for leisure
