19:56 mountained: yes what should the intending do?
20:01 iaj: well for me its not working properly
20:01 iaj: normally you would expect after the {
20:01 iaj: that its 1 MORE indetion level
20:01 iaj: the nxt line
20:01 iaj: but for me its 3
20:01 iaj: which messes up
20:01 iaj: EVERYTHING
20:01 iaj: Did cino+=)4 but that doesn't really solve it as well
20:03 mountained: it works fine for me only 1 level
20:03 iaj: what are your indent settinsg?
20:03 iaj: settings?
20:04 iaj: i mean hen you enter the public foo line
20:04 iaj: when..

20:05 mountained: yes it should
20:05 mountained: your right it doesnt work
