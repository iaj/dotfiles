15:39  Xenith_: hello?
15:40  Xenith_: Users on #dropbox: Xenith_ iaj bmbl rspec22 jjman6___ jjman6__ sshc dethredic cpg|away berny- RichardP
15:40  Xenith_: sry
15:41  bmbl: hm?
15:42  Xenith_: .114 is ahead of .98 per se?
15:42  bmbl: 8.114 is newer yes
15:42  bmbl: But there was a 1.0.0 RC released the day before
15:43  Xenith_: It seems like the "shareable link" has been removed from the shell context menu with regards to the Public folder, any idea why?
15:43  Xenith_: Oh there's newer?
15:43  bmbl: it's linked in a sticky on the forums
15:43  Xenith_: I see, lol. Apparently i'm behind the times by about a day.
15:44  bmbl: And no idea why the menu item does not show up
15:45  Xenith_: I just thought this was convenient for the public folder too, since sometimes I don't want the static ID shown... Shareable links (also with the convenient URL shortener) still work with non-public files, too. 
15:46  Xenith_: Weird.
15:46  Xenith_: I'm installing 1.0 right now, maybe it's changed 
15:50  berny-: hello
15:51  Xenith_: On second thought, it's probably intentional because the website functions the same exact way... not showing "get sharable link" within the public folder. Wonder why...
15:51  Xenith_: Hi
