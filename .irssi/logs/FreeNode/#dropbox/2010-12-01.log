09:22  iaj: lo there
09:22  iaj: is someone up?
09:22  iaj: by chance?
10:05  RichardP: yup
10:05  RichardP: are you still up tho is the question :)
10:20  iaj: :-)
10:20  iaj: yeah.. sorry I didn't expect an answer here anymore heh :)
10:20  iaj: well theres no possibility to give read access only to certain members, right?
10:20  iaj: and another thing:  what if a user extended his dropbox space, but the other shared ones don't?
10:21  iaj: will they be able to access the full storage anyway?
10:44  RichardP: iaj: in the first case, no, not yet - you can use the sharing model introduced with the 0.8 forum builds to give files a read only link, but not shared folders
10:45  RichardP: iaj: in the second case, a free account only ever has access to as much storage as his quota allows - he will not benefit at all from a paid account sharing a folder with him
10:45  RichardP: iaj: if the paid account puts 10GB into the folder, the free account will stop syncing at 2GB
10:48  iaj: RichardP: I get it.. thanks for all your information.. so 2GB must be sufficient - or all the users got to pay
10:55  RichardP: yup
10:55  RichardP: all users have to pay to get access to more than 2GB
11:25  iaj: tahnks a lot
11:26  iaj: and all users get a notifcation if a new file is dropped in tehre/ or changed
11:26  iaj: right?
11:26  iaj: s/tehre/there
12:03  RichardP: yes
