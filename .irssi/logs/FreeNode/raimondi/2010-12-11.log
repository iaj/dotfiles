22:10 iaj: Hey :)
22:10 iaj: Are you into Statuslines somehow?
22:11 Raimondi: I'd say that...
22:12 iaj: theres a g:statusline thingie for the active one correct?
22:12 Raimondi: Not that I know about...
22:13 iaj: hmmm but you can do let statusline=...
22:13 iaj: let &statusline
22:14 iaj: rather :)
22:14 Raimondi: Yep
22:15 iaj: I need to make adjustments to my inactive statusline
22:15 iaj: e.g. I want to colorize a bit of my active one
22:15 iaj: but not at my inactive one... do you know which variable stores the inactive one
22:16 iaj: I only know of StatusLineNC so far.. the highlighting group

22:36 Raimondi: You can use getwinvar()
22:38 iaj: hmm like how?
22:39 iaj: Ahw.. hmmm can I get the guibg code into a variable?
22:39 iaj: like StatusLineNC  guibg  setting...?
22:39 iaj: let b:tempColor= ?
22:39 Raimondi: I haven't played that much with highlighting :(
22:40 iaj: Dohhh... I want to set my User1 color accordingly
22:40 iaj: to any theme I'm using (guibg) that is

23:01 iaj: Hmmm ok... so Nnow I got the color extracted... am I missing something or should that work out
23:01 iaj:         let g:status_inactive_bg=synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("StatusLineNC")), "fg")
23:01 iaj: ahh wrong
23:02 iaj:         hi User1 guifg=#A6E22E guibg=g:status_active_bg
23:02 iaj: theres missing something... since its crying :)
23:02 iaj: about the g:status_active_bg  part
23:03 Raimondi: exec 'hi tatatata'.g:stat...
23:04 iaj:         exec 'hi User1 guifg=#A6E22E guibg=' . g:status_active_bg
23:09 iaj: ok.. so here we go Im FIRST setting colorschem
23:09 iaj: then using         exec 'hi User1 guifg=#A6E22E guibg=' . g:status_active_bg
23:09 iaj: ah damn
23:09 iaj:         let g:status_active_bg=synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("StatusLine")), "fg")
23:10 iaj: that line I mean... but it ain't getting evaluated...   nothing in g:status_active_bg after starting .. however if I exec the line manually, it gets set

23:18 Raimondi: Try with  au VimEnter * let g...
23:20 iaj: is VImEnter executed after vimrc got sourced
23:20 Raimondi: Yes :h VimEnter
23:22 iaj: Mhhh.. I need to do the exec hi User thingies
23:22 iaj: With VIM Enter as well
23:23 iaj: Yummy :-)
23:23 iaj: Thanks so much!
23:24 iaj: Will many au make vim slower?
23:27 Raimondi: I supose  a lot of au could, but I haven't had a problem with them yet.

23:42 iaj: Heh.. okay :-)
23:42 iaj: Vim is just - well so much fun
23:42 iaj: I actually spend more time customizing than using it
23:42 iaj: that's kind of a problem :D
23:42 Raimondi: I know :)
23:47 iaj: how could I write the expression from a :hi User1 to the current buffer?
23:47 iaj: the result* 
23:47 Raimondi: I don't follow you
23:48 iaj: well when I enter :hi User1  on the command line
23:48 iaj: I get a result
23:48 iaj: what its set to.
23:48 iaj: and I want to take that result into my buffer
23:49 Raimondi: :h :redir
23:50 iaj: do you have any mappings to make that easier?
23:50 iaj: can I redir to the current buffer?
23:50 iaj: i only know of redir to a file
23:50 iaj: or redir to @a  registers
23:51 Raimondi: :redir => var |hi User1|redir END| call append(line('$'),var)
23:57 iaj: Ahh.. mhhh I could write a function for that taking the 'hi User1' part as an argument
23:57 iaj: Im wondering something like that isn't exisitng
23:57 Raimondi: I have seen that kind of functions many times...
23:58 Raimondi: Just non as part of Vim
