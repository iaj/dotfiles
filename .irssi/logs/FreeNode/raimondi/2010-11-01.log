00:00 --- Query: Starting query with Raimondi on FreeNode
00:00 iaj: lo there
00:00 iaj: hows life Raimondi 
00:00 Raimondi: Hi iaj, everything is good here, how's it over there?
00:01 iaj: im fine thanks!  gonna watch that wallstreet movie soon :-)
00:01 iaj: but first I wanted you to ask
00:01 iaj: since i heard your engaged in that vimoutliner thingie
00:01 iaj: can you tell me where I could grab its latest version?
00:02 Raimondi: I have a repo in GitHub, the master branch is the last release, 0.3.4, the development branch has the new plugins and can be installed inside your ~/.vim
00:03 Raimondi: I have to make multiple branches to test every new plugin, but I haven't had the time yet.
00:03 iaj: mhh alright :) that sounds fine for me
00:03 iaj: may I have a link?
00:03 Raimondi: http://github.com/Raimondi/vim-pathogen
00:03 Raimondi: Oops
00:03 Raimondi: http://github.com/Raimondi/vimoutliner
00:03 iaj: almost :)
00:03 Raimondi: :)
00:05 iaj: thanks man!
00:05 Raimondi: No problem ;)
00:05 iaj: can you tell me how I could simply test it?
00:06 Raimondi: Do you use pathogen?
00:06 iaj: yeah
00:06 iaj: I already created a symlink there
00:06 iaj: it must be installed
00:06 iaj: just want to run a few tests to see how it works, heh
00:07 Raimondi: Now you should checkout the remote branch development
00:08 iaj: hm im on the development branch
00:08 iaj: already
00:08 iaj: development:git
00:08 Raimondi: OK,  now  vim test.otl
00:09 iaj: k
00:09 iaj: all the ,, bindings are mapped
00:09 Raimondi: Yes
00:09 Raimondi: Well, most
00:10 iaj: what could I try to see how to create mindmpas/
00:10 iaj: mindmaps* sorry
00:11 Raimondi: I'm not sure what a mindmap is or what it requires :(
00:12 iaj: hmmm ok ;]  what are you using tvo for?
00:13 Raimondi: Mostly todo lists, organize my thoughts about something, etc.
00:14 Raimondi: I found this: http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/vimoutliner-mindmap-td1221396.html

23:03 iaj: hey
23:03 iaj: :-)
23:03 Raimondi: Did get the au working?
23:04 iaj: yeah i wanted to say thanks :)
23:04 iaj: echom puts a message and waits for <CR> ?
23:04 Raimondi: No problem :)
23:04 Raimondi: In autocmds?
23:05 iaj: autocmd Filetype java if expand('%:p') =~ expand('~/ba/java/')|map <F9> :!/opt/local/bin/ctags -R --links=yes --java-types=cimp -f tags|endif
23:05 iaj: is that correct with the | stuff?
23:07 Raimondi: the mapping needs all keystrokes if you don't want finish them yourself, you need toput the <CR>
23:07 iaj: -f tags<CR>|endif
23:07 iaj: will work?
23:08 Raimondi: I think it should, give it a try and let me know ;)
23:08 iaj: im asking because the syntax highlighting is kinda wrong
23:08 iaj: the endif isn't highlighted as it should
23:09 iaj: oh it seems to work :-)
23:09 Raimondi: Yeah, there are some issues with the syntax, I shouldn't worry about that unless it doesn't work.
23:09 iaj: but I got another issue I want you to ask - can I run ctags to be runned in a certain folder?
23:10 Raimondi: I'm not sure I follow you...
23:10 iaj: like currenlty it would be run'n'gunned in the current folder
23:10 iaj: in my current PWD
23:10 iaj: but I want it to be runned statically in ~/ba/java/
23:11 Raimondi: I think you have to give ctags the dit as an argument
23:11 Raimondi: dir*
23:13 iaj: k ill try :)
23:13 iaj: thanks

23:31 iaj: you still up?
23:31 iaj: I just won't get it solved heh - the autocommand is working fine - however the ctags part... could you try whether;  ctags -R path/to/folder -f path/to/folder/tags  is working for you?
