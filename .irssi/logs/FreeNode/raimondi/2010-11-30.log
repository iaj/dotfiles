10:02 iaj: lo here
10:02 iaj: there*
10:02 iaj: may i drop a question?
10:02 Raimondi: Sure, fire at will :)
10:02 iaj: wooooooohhhhoo
10:02 iaj: going
10:02 iaj: how can I map something to the option key on Mac/
10:04 Raimondi: You need to make it function as the Meta/Alt with  :set macmeta , but it's a all or nothing, you will lose the usual functionality inside of MacVim
10:06 iaj: huh... what's its usual functionality? :)
10:06 iaj: and after I set macmeta.. how would I proceed
10:07 iaj: in mapping?
10:07 iaj: map <M-,> <C-W>>
10:07 iaj: got that currently for example.
10:07 Raimondi: Yep, <M- or <A-
10:08 iaj: what's its usual use of meta?
10:08 iaj: does one ever need it?
10:08 Raimondi: Well, if you don't know what id oes, I supose you won't miss it :)
10:09 iaj: heh.. yeah :)
10:09 iaj: never used it
10:09 Raimondi: It's used to get extra characters out of the keyboard
10:09 Raimondi: Try hittng some key while holding it
10:10 Raimondi: down
10:12 iaj: ahww. ok.. im using <C-K> for those
10:14 Raimondi: Of course! that's the Vim way :)
10:17 iaj: hehe :-)
10:17 iaj: yay!
