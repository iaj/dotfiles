02:13 Raimondi: Are you?
02:18 iaj: Yeah :)
02:18 iaj: How can I get the contents of &omnifunc?
02:19 Raimondi: In what context?
02:20 iaj: in vimscript.. oh its just the setting :set omnifunc   ?
02:20 Raimondi: let var = &omnifunc
02:21 iaj: ill show you what im trying to get :)
02:21 Raimondi: OK
02:21 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/302556
02:21 iaj: the if &filetype == 'java' part
02:21 iaj: will that work?
02:22 Raimondi: It should
02:23 iaj: Hmmm ok but something is sitll wrong :(
02:24 iaj: can I check if the wildmenu is currenlty open?
02:25 iaj: because currently it doesn't lemme browse through completition choices
02:26 iaj: or rather if the lastkeypress was TAB
02:26 Raimondi: Yes... :h pumvisible()
02:28 iaj: mhh ok thanks :)
02:28 iaj: do you know a way how I could make-- if another tab is pressed... it should return "\<c-p>" ?
02:28 iaj: so if I press tab twice... what would be a nice solution to that?
02:30 Raimondi: if line[col('.') - 2 ] == "<\Tab>"
02:31 Raimondi: No, wait that would work if the first tab inserted a tab
02:31 iaj: hmm that's representing the char before
02:31 iaj: yeah.. well do I need a variable to save the current state in?
02:31 Raimondi: I think
02:32 Raimondi: so
02:36 iaj: Ah just pumvisible solved my problem ;-)
02:36 Raimondi: Good :)
02:36 iaj: WOah its pretty amazing and actually useful now :-)
02:39 Raimondi: Congratz! :)
02:40 iaj: can I somehow have the matches in the completition list printed in reverse order?
02:40 iaj: for <C-p> that is :\
02:40 Raimondi: I think not :(

22:20 --- Query: Starting query with Raimondi on FreeNode
22:20 iaj: Raimondi, you up?
22:22 Raimondi: Yes
22:22 iaj: I need a scriptguru :(
22:22 iaj: When I want to return the value of a variable..
22:22 Raimondi: I'll try to find one...
22:22 iaj: eg. for debugging a function
22:22 iaj: Hahaha
22:22 iaj: :-D
22:22 iaj: I found one !
22:22 Raimondi: What are you trying to do?
22:22 Raimondi: lol
22:23 iaj: I want to know what value a certain variable got.
22:23 iaj: I tried echo(variable)  but I don't get anything in my :messages
22:23 iaj: when I call the function
22:26 iaj: get what I'm trying to achieve :-) ?
22:28 Raimondi: I'm back, sorry. Use echom
22:28 Raimondi: echom variable
22:28 iaj: echom ?
22:28 iaj: ok :)
22:28 Raimondi: Then you can see it with :messages
22:28 Raimondi: :h :echomessage
22:28 iaj: Ahhh thanks :)
22:28 iaj: What exactly is ;echo doing?
22:29 iaj: only echoing it to the commandline but not to the message-container?
22:29 Raimondi: Yes, whatever it echoes will be erased after a redraw, iirc
22:30 iaj: Raimondi Thannnnnnnnnnks
22:30 Raimondi: No problem :)
22:30 iaj: so you usually use echom as well?
22:30 Raimondi: Yes
22:31 iaj: Do i have to use <CR> at the end?
22:31 Raimondi: No, it's just a regular ex command
22:31 Raimondi: Like :echo
22:32 iaj: Hmmmm.. strange.
22:32 Raimondi: Â¿?
22:32 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/302894
22:32 iaj: ok... ignore the <CR>
22:32 iaj: is there a dumb way in my thinking?
22:33 iaj: Oh..
22:33 Raimondi: That happens ;)
22:33 iaj: getchar is waiting for my input?
22:34 Raimondi: I think it should
22:34 iaj: Hmmmm
22:34 iaj: I just tried the following
22:34 iaj:     echom &omnifunc
22:35 iaj: that should have something when :set omnifunc=java
22:39 iaj: ND
22:39 iaj: NEVERMIND
22:44 iaj: But a new question occured.. can I somehow have a seperate window tailing that messages?
22:45 iaj: hmm I could use w line >> log   I guess.
22:45 Raimondi: Yep
22:45 iaj: would that simply be a line   w line >> ~/log     ?
22:45 iaj: or do I have to surround the line with something?
22:46 Raimondi: :[range]w >> file
22:48 iaj: how could I write a simple varialbe to a file then.. is that possible?  :!echo b:test >> file ?
22:48 Raimondi: :exec '!echo '.var.'>> file'
22:49 iaj: Thanks so muuch !! I won't bug you anymore now :-)
22:49 Raimondi: Hey! it's not a problem, I like giving a hand, it's a good way to learn.
22:49 Raimondi: ;)
22:52 iaj: :-))
22:52 iaj: anyhow - such stupid questions
22:52 Raimondi: Well, many questions seem silly _after_ you know the answer :)
22:56 iaj: True.. but.. yeah.. heh :-)
