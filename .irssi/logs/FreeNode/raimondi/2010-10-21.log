20:29 iaj: Damn :-)
20:29 iaj: You still up?
20:30 Raimondi: Yep, what's up?
20:30 iaj: Your sticking to MacVim as well?
20:30 iaj: is your $PATH correctly there?
20:30 iaj: That one is really bugging me atm :\
20:31 Raimondi: iirc, I had to play with .zprofile
20:31 Raimondi: I use zsh
20:32 iaj: hm yeah.. and then it worked?
20:32 iaj: kjk
20:33 iaj: do you have any settings changed in your macvim prefpane?
20:34 iaj: Hmm my path is set correctly now.. but even if ctags is in /Users/iaj/bin which comes first... !which ctags is giving me /usr/bin/ctags
20:35 Raimondi: Can't say, it's been a long while since I installed MacVim. I have checked "Use experimental renderer" and "Draw marked text inline".
20:35 iaj: ok I got those as well set.
20:35 Raimondi: Let me do a test to see if .zprofile is needed.
20:35 iaj: Doh-age.. and changing my zprofile did the trick... the PATH is set correctly however its sticking to /usr/bin
20:36 iaj: even if $HOME/bin comes first in list
20:36 iaj: troublesome.
20:36 iaj: thanks mate
20:37 Raimondi: Yeah, renaming .zprofile makes my $PATH go back to default.
20:37 iaj: could you do a test
20:37 iaj: check whether - when you got 2 files - 2 similar ones one in a path that comes first in list
20:37 iaj: and one in /usr/bin
20:37 iaj: which one is used/
20:39 Raimondi: !which -a vim  reports them in the correct order.
20:40 iaj: r/bin/ctags
20:40 iaj: /Users/iaj/bin/ctags
20:40 iaj: /opt/local/bin/ctags        
20:40 iaj: first one is //usr/bin/ctags
20:40 iaj: oDD
20:40 iaj: :echo $PATH is correctly right?
20:40 Raimondi: what is $PATH
20:40 iaj: the MacVim $PATH no?
20:40 iaj: where its looking :(
20:40 Raimondi: Yep
20:40 Raimondi: :echo $PATH
20:41 iaj: Do I have to reload something?
20:42 Raimondi: Well, if you modified .zprofile, I'd suggest to reload vim
20:42 iaj: did that a few times already
20:42 iaj: $PATH is correctly as well
20:42 Raimondi: What do you get in terminal?
20:43 iaj: in terminal for path I get the same
20:43 iaj: but which ctags
20:43 iaj: gives me ~/bin/ctags
20:43 iaj: which is correct
20:43 iaj: When I use the command line tool mvim to laod up MacVim
20:43 iaj: its working as well :\
20:44 Raimondi: Why don't you ask in #zsh ?  the people there is usually helpful and many use vim/mac
20:44 Raimondi: Oh! it's only with MacVim?
20:44 Raimondi: That's weird.
20:45 Raimondi: Have you set the paths the Apple sanctioned way?
20:46 iaj: huh?
20:46 iaj: sec
20:46 iaj: ./Users/iaj/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin
20:46 iaj: that's what I got.
20:47 iaj: I asked on #zsh - lets see if they got some help :(
20:52 iaj: 3
20:52 iaj: pretty strange -_-
20:52 iaj: so for you it's working...
20:54 Raimondi: Yep
20:55 iaj: another thingie.. currently I've got map <F9> :!/opt/local/bin/ctags --exclude=.svn --exclude=target -R .<CR>
20:56 iaj: in my _vimrc - but what dir will that work on?
20:59 Raimondi: Your current
20:59 Raimondi: :pwd

21:05 iaj: Ahwww thanks
21:06 iaj: do you do coding in vim
21:08 iaj: 21:06:02  iaj: do you do coding in vim
21:09 Raimondi: Not much, coding is just a hobby
21:10 Raimondi: 11 pm over there? where are you located?
21:14 iaj: heh, germany :-)
21:14 iaj: Coding is just a hobby... what exactly is ctags used for.. can I jump to functions under the cursor with ctags?
21:15 Raimondi: Germany! do you play chess by any chance?  a lot of users on a chess site I use are german.
21:15 iaj: haha, no... :-) I used to - but that.. really is a while back
21:15 iaj: so you play chess :-D
21:16 Raimondi: Yes, :h 29.1
21:16 Raimondi: Yeah, another hobby :)
21:19 iaj: Woah... ok... seems like I really need to get the hang of it :\
21:19 iaj: not so convenient to code java in VIM i guess
21:19 Raimondi: Yeah, it's quite useful.
21:20 Raimondi: No idea :(
21:20 Raimondi: tg ctags java
21:20 Raimondi: oops!
21:21 Raimondi: Google thinks you can use with java.
21:21 iaj: well for example... if there are 2 classes
21:21 iaj: with the same funciton name
21:22 iaj: Foobar.parse
21:22 iaj: Barfoo.parse
21:22 iaj: and im on a parse somewhere - it doesn't know on where to go
21:23 Raimondi: Seems like vim handles multiple matches  with :tselect tagname
