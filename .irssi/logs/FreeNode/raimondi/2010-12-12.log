00:01 iaj: Oh. mhh ok
00:01 iaj: you still around?
00:01 Raimondi: Yep
00:01 iaj: would if !(&varname =~ 'string') 
00:01 iaj: work ?
00:01 iaj: or something wrong with the syntax
00:03 Raimondi: Looks fine, I'd use !~ instead, but it's just personal preference.
00:08 iaj: im confused
00:08 iaj: im using %1*%-2.2n%* %t (%2*%{(&fenc==""?&enc:&fenc)}%*)%( [%4*%H%R%M%*]%)%=%(%3*%{SyntaxItem()}%*%) %-14.(%l/%L,%v%) %P %4*%{fugitive#statusline()}%*%{XPMautoUpdate("statusline")}
00:08 iaj: agh... that is my Statusline set to
00:08 iaj: &stl..
00:08 iaj: so..         if (&stl !~ 'SyntaxItem')
00:08 iaj: should not pull off.. correct?
00:09 iaj: the else part would be called
00:09 Raimondi: Yes
00:12 iaj: Hmmm that's strange
00:12 iaj: Im just doing set statusline="<C-R>=&statusline"
00:12 iaj: but there seems to be problems with the "  :(

00:32 iaj: Hmmm
00:32 iaj: You still up?
00:33 iaj: I want to have a simple :ll<CR> call inside a function
00:33 iaj: why isn't     :ll<CR>
00:33 iaj: working?
00:33 Raimondi: you only need to put  ll
00:34 iaj: Ahhwww... can I somehow check if location list or quickfix window is currenlty active?
00:34 iaj: Or are there some kind of things in locationlist / in quickfix list?
00:35 Raimondi: :h 'buftype'
00:40 iaj: Hmm what Im trying to do is a mapping for the locationlist that is able to browse through the errors
00:40 iaj: But so far I could only find
00:40 iaj: :ll which is working if there is one error... (while :lne is NOT)
00:40 iaj: and :lne which is working if theres more than 1 but not if theres only 1
00:44 iaj: can I check whether I'm sitting on an error from the location list?
00:45 Raimondi: Is there something else besides errors?
00:46 iaj: nah its just displaying (1 of 2) error: bla bla
00:46 iaj: in my commandline

00:52 iaj: Sorry another problem showed up - can I somehow set my titlestring to the current PWD?

01:38 Raimondi: No idea.
01:40 iaj: Hmmm aight :-)  What would the autocommand be for writing a buffer?
01:40 iaj: BufWrite ?
01:41 Raimondi: Maybe, depends on what you need  :h BufWrite

17:27 Raimondi: Hi there! How did it go?

17:39 iaj: Well it went ok... fixed all the statusline thingies :)
17:39 Raimondi: Good :)
17:40 iaj: Just another question currently I'm trying to have a function that looks up if C-] (e.g the :tag function) would succedd or not.. if succeed: use the c-] function else - use a custom command
17:40 iaj: is that possible to achieve?
17:42 Raimondi: Well, I did something like that. I used a try|normal "\<C-]>|catch [error here]|do something else|endtry

17:54 Raimondi: So I actually do the c-] and do something else if it raises an error (create the tag file in my case).
17:54 Raimondi: brb

18:13 iaj: hmmmm I tried that I think 
18:14 iaj: can I see that mapping?

19:15 Raimondi: https://gist.github.com/738220
19:15 Raimondi: IT's a function, the try part starts on line 79
19:18 iaj: Woah... Yeah.. that looks suitable
19:19 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/304003
19:19 iaj: i had something like that set up
19:19 iaj: shouldn't that work too?
19:20 Raimondi: IF tag raises an error, it should.
19:20 iaj: the c-] is only looking for a \<word\> under the cursor right?
19:22 Raimondi: iirc, yes
19:23 iaj: E432 tag file not sorted tags  - can I force that somehow with ctags?
19:23 Raimondi: No idea.
19:24 Raimondi: How did you created the tags file?
19:27 iaj: hm

20:03 iaj: catch without any / /   will catch ALL exceptions, right?
20:03 Raimondi: Yes
20:08 iaj: Ok so now I got the following
20:09 iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/304018
20:10 iaj: but its evaluating and giving me an echo No results for '...'.
20:10 iaj: can I somehow stop that and if its giving me 'No results...'   <C-]> it?

21:37 iaj: my i-Net s*** so hard :\
21:37 Raimondi: I don't think so

21:44 Raimondi: Don't know.
