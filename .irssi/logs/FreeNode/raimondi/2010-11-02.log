09:41 iaj: :-)
09:41 iaj: thevimoutliner - can I rebind the ,, structure to something else?
09:43 Raimondi: You can set it in the vimoutlinerrc file, there is a commented line like  let maplocalleader
09:45 Raimondi: I don't like that, btw
09:45 Raimondi: IT should be set no the vimrc...
09:45 iaj: hmmmm i have to tweak the vimoutlinerrc file?
09:46 iaj: ah I see it
09:46 Raimondi: Yep, that's where vimoutliner's settings go
09:46 iaj: the problem is that I use ,, for alternating between too buffers  .. eg. map ,, <C-6>
09:46 iaj: so I got a delay every time now
09:46 iaj: but you are using ,, ?
09:47 Raimondi: Yes, but you should be able to change it, just set maplocalleader inside the vimoutlinerrc
09:47 iaj: im just curious on what to set it to
09:47 iaj: \\ i gues

15:55 Raimondi: set updatetime=100
15:56 iaj: won't that perform speed issues?
15:56 Raimondi: It might.
15:57 iaj: u use taglist a lot don't you?
15:58 Raimondi: Yeah, but I mostly use the menu.
16:02 iaj: which menu?!
16:02 iaj: :-
16:03 iaj: :-)
16:03 iaj: oh btw do you remember my path problem
16:03 iaj: with MacVim?
16:03 Raimondi: It can show a menu :)
16:03 iaj: which menu!? :D I don't know what you mean :(
16:04 Raimondi: It has an option to add a menu in the GUI
16:04 iaj: omg, so you use the mouse?
16:04 iaj: curse yoU :)
16:04 * Raimondi blushes
16:04 iaj: btw  /private/etc/paths.d   that path need to manipulated on macosx for !echo $PATH to work correctly
16:05 Raimondi: Good
16:05 iaj: /etc/paths
16:05 iaj: actually
16:05 iaj: yeah :D
16:05 iaj: mac osx is strange in that behaviour
