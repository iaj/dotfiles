08:56  hemanth: can a associative array be imploded to an a string with key and values?
08:57  srmaddox: in a foreach ($x as $y) loop, how can i return the current key, matching the value $y ?
08:57  srmaddox: rather, the current key. period.
08:57  courpse: srmaddox: foreach($x AS $key => $value) { ... }
09:04  logan_wolf: setcookie("user", "$uid", time()+3600), this function is not able to set cookie.... am I doing something wrong
09:04  logan_wolf: where $uid is the value from a previous form which is coming correctly
09:04  logan_wolf: any ideas ??
09:04  thadin: Like other headers, cookies must be sent before any output from your script (this is a protocol restriction).
09:04  dr0id: Northwoods: ?
09:04  semaphore: well, i know the time() is wrong
09:04 * Northwoods accuses dr0id
09:05  dr0id: you talking about ajavid?
09:05  Northwoods: no
09:05  dr0id: chal yaar, paka mat
09:05  Northwoods: stoned
09:05  dr0id: yeah, both are same
09:06  Northwoods: ah ok
09:06  logan_wolf: thadin, thnx I'll try that
09:09  vhuren: if I have an array with elements such as array(0 => 'blah', 1 => 'blah2', 2 => 'blah3') etc and I would like to insert an element 1 => 'blah1' into it so it would reindex the current 1 => 'blah2' to 2 => 'blah2' what is the easiest way?
09:10  vhuren: array(0 => 'blah', 1 => 'blah1', 2 => 'blah2', 3 => 'blah3')
09:10  vhuren: should be the end result
09:12  thadin: $arr[] = 'blah1'; sort($arr);
09:13  vhuren: those blah1 things could be whatever text, not in any specific alphabetic order
09:13  vhuren: sorry forgot to mention that
09:14  MartinCo: vhuren, you want to maintain order ?
09:15 @LawnGnome: vhuren: You basically want array_splice() with the length parameter set to 0 (so it doesn't remove any existing items).
09:15  vhuren: ok let me read up on that function
09:16  logan_wolf: thnx thadin that worked
09:16  logan_wolf: thadin, I have another doubt regarding the same
09:16  vhuren: MartinCo: I want to maintain key order but cause the array to increment the keys of all following elements when I add an element with the same key to the array
09:16  vhuren: LawnGnome: let me read up, thanks you for the reply
09:17 @LawnGnome: vhuren: The last array_splice() call in example #1 at http://php.net/array_splice is pretty much the same as your case.
09:17  logan_wolf: thadin, I am fetching the a value corresponding to that value from the database how can I store that in cookies before everything
09:17  thadin: logan_wolf: just before output (i.e html, text)
09:17  thadin: you can place other php code above it
09:18  logan_wolf: thadin, thnx man I'll just check it too ;)
09:18  vhuren: LawnGnome: thank you sir :)
09:20  logan_wolf: thadin, thnx bro
09:40  doonie: Fatal error: Method purchaseOrderLine::__tostring() cannot take arguments in purchase.php on line 96 :::::: public function __toString($type=null)?
09:40  ss23: doonie: Just take out the $type=null
09:41  doonie: yeah that's the only way. but the function uses the $type for a swtich?
09:41  ss23: That method can't take any arguemnts
09:41  ss23: doonie: How would oyu swithc?
09:41  doonie: oh its a magic func?
09:41 @TML: doonie: You cannot define __toString() as a method that takes an argument
09:41  ss23: Yeah
09:41  ss23: doonie: echo $object
09:41  ss23: That called $object->__toString
09:41  doonie: bleh, it works on our dev but not live.. diff php versions
09:41  ss23: Ah, I hate that
09:42 @TML: doonie: As a general rule, anything that has __ in it is magical
09:42  doonie: coders that did this project were high ;\
09:42  ss23: But you try working on PHP5 dev, then releasing to PHP4
09:42  doonie: TML in this project loads of stuff do, the coders thought it would look 'good'... now I'm stuck with nonworking stuff :)
09:42  doonie: ss23 the art of never updating shit heh
09:43  ss23: Yeah, they managed to make the transition from PHP3 -> PHP4 at some point, and now it's time to do the PHP4 -> PHP5. The 'solution' is to write code that works perfectly on both :/
09:43 @TML: doonie: You said "oh its a magic func?" - I'm telling you that if it starts with __, that's pretty much given
09:43  ss23: I dread to think how much stuff is going to break when we make the proper upgrade though. Thosuands of screens and crons and scripts etc :/
09:43  ss23: Anyway, home time :D
09:43  ss23: apart from __imNotMagic
09:43  ss23: That one isn't magic
09:43  doonie: yeah I understand. Though this project has function names using __xx ;\ thus the confusion
09:44  doonie: this is we didn't make an upgrade, I just pushed some new stuff live. 'using svn on live huhuhu' and it seems like they made changes on the live server and never commited :)
09:44  doonie: love this workplace heh
09:45  ss23: Sounds fail :/
09:45  ss23: I've had it happen before
09:45 * ss23 runs off
09:45  doonie: see ya :)
09:45  MartinCo: doonie, you didn't svn st before upping ?
09:45  doonie: ofc.
09:45  MartinCo: i prefer svn switch to make a right balls up of stuff :P
09:46  doonie: and then used mine conflicts ;D
09:46  doonie: since the files shouldn't be touched live!
09:46  doonie: nor updated through svn for that matter, but that's another story
09:47 * MartinCo says lock down the server
09:47  doonie: 20% use svn, 40% use ftp 40% misc.. never know what project does what <3 exciting!
09:48 @TML: doonie: Make a cron job that hourly overwrites the production code with svn HEAD
09:48 @TML: People will start committing
09:49  doonie: hehe
09:49 @TML: I've had to use guerilla-tactics many times to teach people the value of version control
09:49  doonie: svn revert; svn up HEAD; yea that would be nice. still noone should touch live files.
09:50 @TML: One guy, I just started coming into work before anyone else in the morning once a month, grabbing a hammer, cracking his case open, and pounding on the hard drive for a few minutes
09:50  doonie: haha what
09:50 * doonie checks his hdd, heey!
09:51 @TML: After the 4th drive failure, he started committing code, because it was the only way he could be sure not to lose stuff
09:51 @LawnGnome: TML: Rubber mallets don't leave marks. :)
09:51  DukeDrake: hi
09:51  DukeDrake: I've got a rather large background image
09:51  doonie: boards don't hit back, kind of zen :)
09:51  DukeDrake: is it possible to somehow tell the browser to cache that image?
09:51 @TML: LawnGnome: Well, you don't have to hit hard enough to leave a mark - just make sure it's doing a virus scan or something when you hit it
09:51 @TML: all you have to do is make the read head hit the platter
09:52  doonie: just remove some pins from the ide, or break the sata connector :) dojne
09:52  doonie: -j
09:52 @LawnGnome: TML: True. I just like using tools with extra margin for error if I get angry halfway through. ;)
09:52 @TML: LawnGnome: heh - fair
09:53  Keloran: TML: why didnt you just fire him, would have saved you money too
09:53  doonie: DukeDrake browsers cache all images if the header is proper
09:54  Keloran: DukeDrake: why not put it through a better image compressor ?
09:54  doonie: maybe it's just big ;p
09:54  Keloran: in that case rethink the background to something more sensible
09:54 @TML: doonie: Unless the image is larger than allowed cache size
09:55  DukeDrake: doonie: erm .. hence I conclude my header is foo :/
09:55  skeeel: hello
09:55 @TML: DukeDrake: Share an example, we'll take a look at your headers
09:55  DukeDrake: Keloran: hm ... what image compressors are there?
09:56  DukeDrake: I set "<meta name="expires" content="86400" />"
09:57  skeeel: at first i have string(18) " 180573306668    " i apply str_replace(" ","",$var); i get string(14) " 180573306668" but it seems impossible to remove the first space , any idea why ?
09:57 @TML: DukeDrake: Well, two popular ones are libjpeg and libpng
09:57 @TML: I guess Google is pretty excited about their new one, VP8
09:57  DukeDrake: oh ... an "header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate");"
09:57  doonie: and them only :)
09:58 @TML: DukeDrake: Uh - that 'meta' won't affect the IMAGE.
09:58  Keloran: DukeDrake: jpeg, png, webp
09:58 @TML: skeeel: var_dump(ord($var[0]));
09:58  doonie: I read that vp8 < jpeg on quality?
09:58  DukeDrake: erm ... it *is* a jpg already?
09:58  doonie: or was it compression
09:59  doonie: anyhow, it didn't look good from reading that
09:59 @TML: doonie: There are some people who are displeased with the visual results
09:59  courpse: Any idea why: if (isset(trim($users[5]))) {
09:59  lewellyn: not that people aren't unhappy with every other option
09:59 @TML: doonie: I can't say it would affect 99% of the content I generate
09:59  Keloran: webp has slightlly better compression, and slightlly better color matching, but its not a "jpeg killer"
09:59  doonie: TML the uber flick ppl? :)
09:59 @LawnGnome: doonie: From the benchmarks I've seen, and my own playing with it, WebP definitely looks a bit better in terms of file size against quality. I actually prefer the compression artefacts of WebP, but that's going to be very subjective.
09:59  courpse: Would return: PHP Fatal error:  Can't use function return value in write context in
09:59  doonie: flikr even
09:59 @TML: doonie: Yes
09:59  Altreus: What function(s) can I use to send an HTTP GET request and find the response code? I'm currently using get_headers but it doesn't work with a query string -_-
09:59  DukeDrake: erm o.o will header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); prevent my image from being cached?
10:00 @TML: courpse: You can't call isset() on the return value from a function call
10:00  doonie: it didn't have transparency did it?
10:00  courpse: Um.
10:00  courpse: Sorry?
10:00  courpse: i cant hav trim inside it?
10:00 @TML: courpse: isset($MUST_BE_A_VARAIBLE)
10:00  Keloran: the human eye cant really tell the difference between a "high" jpeg and and a "mid-high" webp image, high on webp is better, but really who does "high" when doing anything they always look rubbish
10:00  courpse: rigth.
10:00  courpse: Never knew that, heh, thanks.
10:01  courpse: rotfl, TML ofcourse, Sorry, no idea why i was trying to do that.
10:01  Keloran: LawnGnome: you should say that in #web all yesterday they were complaining that WebP looked worse, hehe
10:01 --- heshan_ is now known as heshan
10:02  ocke: webp? wtf
10:02  DukeDrake: it still relaods the image :/
10:02 @LawnGnome: Keloran: Well, like I said, it's going to be subjective. I do wonder if it's just a case of people being used to JPEG's behaviour at this point. :)
10:02  lewellyn: i'm still waiting on jpeg2000 and mng support
10:03  Keloran: lewellyn: your gona be waiting a very long time
10:03  Keloran: lewellyn: webp support will come first (since htye submit patches to webkit)
10:03 @LawnGnome: lewellyn: Sadly, I don't see either gaining much traction now -- if they were going to, it would have happened some years ago when they were newer and hotter. Plus, Mozilla did a pretty good job of killing whatever support MNG and JNG had a few years back with their extreme case of NIH syndrome. *grumble*
10:03  skeeel: TLM i get int(194)
10:03  lewellyn: Keloran: likewise for anything else to be supported widely
10:03  Keloran: ocke: its the latest image compression from Google
10:03 * Altreus does puppy eyes °_°
10:04  lewellyn: yeah. instead they opted for the broken apng thing :P
10:04  ocke: Keloran: hm i was reading that
10:04 @TML: Keloran: http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/archives/541 has an example image that really highlights some of the artifacting differences between JPEG and VP8
10:04  ocke: Keloran: it doesn't work so far in any browser right?
10:04  d3c: what's the best way to handle input validation across multiple php files? write a shared validation class?
10:04  ocke: "so you will be able to view your images in an upcoming release of Google Chrome. "
10:04 @TML: as for which one is better, as LawnGnome suggests, this is going to be entirely subjective
10:04  Keloran: TML: i was expecting to read the Golden Frame talk again (which is useless on VP8)
10:05  lewellyn: i was really hoping mng would be supported by ie9. *sigh*
10:07  ocke: Keloran: hmm on those sample images x264 (png's) look by far the best
10:07 @LawnGnome: On a blog by an x264 developer? Shocking, really. :P
10:07  DukeDrake: d3c: maybe use a dispatcher class for every request to your server
10:07  ocke: LawnGnome: well i have been reading this guys blog a bit, and he seems quit fair.
10:07  ocke: quite
10:08  Altreus: strip_tags doesn't remove the contents of style tags?
10:08 @LawnGnome: ocke: Eh, I'm still annoyed about the WebM analysis he did, which focused on an awful lot of stuff that didn't matter and compared it to a profile of H.264 nobody uses in reality.
10:09  ocke: LawnGnome: hmm okey
10:09  d3c: DukeDrake: how's that?
10:09 @LawnGnome: In related news, I'm a tad cranky at times. Reel at 11. ;)
10:09 @TML: LawnGnome: I was more interested in the JPEG vs. WebP comparisons
10:10  Altreus: Is this known? http://pastebin.com/DA2ERBnf
10:10  Altreus: oh wait
10:10  vector_xyz: What do you guys use to document your code... do i write docs manually or can i make comments and have it document ?
10:10  Altreus: I just realised what I'm saying -_-
10:10  Altreus: New question: Why am I awake?
10:10  DukeDrake: d3c: make any request to your scripts pass a dispatcher first, which will handle and sanitize input data, then decide what to do with the data ...
10:10 @LawnGnome: TML: Yeah, they're definitely interesting. I started working on a set myself, but ran out of time on the day WebP was announced and then everyone else beat me to it. :)
10:10  DukeDrake: (or the request)
10:10  Altreus: new question: is there a strip_tags equivalent that removes tags *and their contents*?
10:11  ocke: LawnGnome: but in the end, does it all really matters?
10:11  Keloran: vector_xyz: personally write comments, and write phpdoc comments, and then run though a "documentor" and then fill that generated document with relevant info that doesnt need to go into the actual code
10:11  vector_xyz: TML: What do most php devs use as a practice/methodology to complete php projects... Scrum or so ?
10:12  Altreus: luck
10:12 * Altreus ducks
10:12  ocke: LawnGnome: i mean, I laughed @ 'evolution of dance', while it was shit composition, shit lighting, shit music, shity moving camera. But hey it was funny as hell!
10:12  doonie: scrum sound sinteresting, we dont use that though ;(
10:12  vector_xyz: Keloran: ah so write only so much comments... as needed to define the function and later once phpdoc generates stuff go through it and add all those extra comments ?
10:12  Keloran: LawnGnome: he did point out hte Golden Frame part of WebM that does a really good job (for what it does), but anything outside the golden frame might aswell be covered in jam
10:13 @LawnGnome: ocke: *shrug* It really depends on whether Google can convince other browser manufacturers to adopt WebP. They've done a fair job with WebM so far; they're probably (with Microsoft) one of the very few companies who might have the clout to make it work. Really, whether it's technically better hardly matters, as you've just said. :)
10:13  Keloran: vector_xyz: thats what i do yeah, each dev has there own method
10:13 @TML: vector_xyz: I think "seat of their pants" is probably the most apt description
10:13  vector_xyz: doonie: what do you guys use... i started working in a new company .. i manage 4 coders... im just curious how to manage good so i can get the php projects done on time and be organized.
10:13  doonie: we use nada :) one big fa1l
10:14  doonie: would love to use scrum, buddy of mine has it at his work.. Seems to work great for them
10:14  Keloran: vector_xyz: leave them alone todo there thing, and once/twice a week have a brain storming method, (generatlization) ALL developers hate being micro-managed
10:14  Fratyr: thats true
10:14  Fratyr: I hate it
10:14  Fratyr: we're Gods. gtfo of our place, come to see new branch next week ;D
10:15  Keloran: vector_xyz: on the monday, have a brain storm and say what going todo, on thursday have a follow up seeing if stuff is having troubles and storm, leave alone for the rest of the time
10:15  Fratyr: and yeh.. we need another 4 weeks to debug this, Boss...
10:15 @TML: vector_xyz: I don't know what the fact that you're developing in PHP would have to do with the methodology you select
10:15  srmaddox: file_get_contents versus fopen/fread/fclose, which is better performance wise for local files?
10:15  Keloran: vector_xyz: and never ever launch anything on a monday or friday
10:16 @TML: Choose one that you think is likely to work for your scenario
10:16  vector_xyz: Keloran: why is that ?
10:16  Fratyr: o_0
10:16  doonie: mondays and fridays ah :) the curse rests upon these days
10:16  Fratyr: "never ever launch anything on a monday or friday" developer's commandment
10:17  Keloran: vector_xyz: release on a monday, people are still trying to debug stuff from the weekend, release on a friday and if anything goes wrong you have a whole weekend where nothing works
10:17  lewellyn: always release at 17:00 friday
10:17 @TML: Or, more likely, you have no weekend
10:17 @LawnGnome: Mondays aren't so bad in my experience, but yeah, anyone who releases anything on a Friday is just asking for trouble. And angry phone calls.
10:17  lewellyn: that always makes happy hour happier!
10:17  doonie: hehe
10:17  vector_xyz: got it your right.
10:17  Keloran: naw i have a rule in my contract, if something is forced release on friday and it goes wrong i am paid 4x to come in on a weekend
10:17  kent\n: srmaddox: you are asking the wrong question. You should solve the problem in the most logical way, then optimise later, if, and ony if, its a problem.
10:18  kent\n: srmaddox: otherwise you'll write evil code nobody will want to maintain
10:18  Xyphoid: i think it's kind of vital to talk to your devs regularly
10:19  lewellyn: but not necessarily daily or more often.
10:19  lewellyn: "it depends"
10:19  srmaddox: mm... I dont see really a logical difference between fopen/fread/fclose and file get contents. I mean, truthfully, since its a straight read with no further operations, opening a file handle isnt logically required
10:19  doonie: Keloran only 2x here ;( luckely only happened once
10:19 @TML: Yeah, bad idea trying to get specific about that - I have one guy, if I don't check in every hour, I can be sure he won't get anything done
10:19  kent\n: if you want to get nothing done, dev meetings hourly are perscribed ;)
10:20  lewellyn: TML: company irc is often a good thing
10:20  Fratyr: TML: U,S? :)
10:20  Fratyr: U.S*
10:20  kent\n: srmaddox: the logical difference is : 1 opens a file and assigns all its contents to a variable in one step, and the other one opens the file and then you can read it incrementally
10:21  kent\n: srmaddox: I suggest you use file_get_contents unless you have a good reason  not to =)
10:21  vector_xyz: I know this chan doesnt like IDE Talk... i have a Q.. i need an IDE that is simple small has syntax hilight and can commit to git and svn... the rest i dont care about... do you know of any that can commit to git/svn from within.
10:21  Fratyr: Eclipse?
10:22 @LawnGnome: vim with a couple of custom commands in the .vimrc? :P
10:22  kent\n: vector_xyz: unix + vim ? =)
10:22  salathe: vector_xyz: so, you don't need an IDE at all
10:22  kent\n: "unix is my ide"
10:23  vector_xyz: im on windows*
10:23  lewellyn: i use vim on windows
10:24  lewellyn: works just the same ;)
10:26  ross`: lewellyn: is it possible to rename javascript files .php instead of .js and have php code inside them
10:26  DukeDrake: notepad++ with function list %)
10:28  Keloran: vector_xyz: no idea if there is an ide that can submit to git and svn, nativly
10:28  Fratyr: ross`: It is, but why you have this?
10:29  lewellyn: ross`: sure. but it doesn't necessarily make sense to do it.
10:29  kent\n: native git support in windows is lacking for starters, you can do it with mysysgit or whatever its called, it works, but I can't see an /IDE/ ( as you call it ) supporting that without a bit of dark magic
10:29  dr0id: what word would this correspond to -> Glam&acirc;€™eyes ?
10:29  ross`: lewellyn: i need to query a mysql database to form a ajax function
10:30  Fratyr: TML: fire that dev and hire me. I can handle all my tasks by myself and I work a lot. ;-)
10:30  DukeDrake: &acirc; = â
10:30  courpse: ross`: Just send the javascript headers, and you can jkust fine, :)
10:30  Keloran: DukeDrake: an a with a little tick above it i think
10:31  Keloran: oh you were ansering, soz
10:31  DukeDrake: ok, I switched on caching like so: http://www.php.net/manual/de/function.header.php#93377 ... but my images still get reloaded on page reload :/
10:31  dr0id: DukeDrake: yeah
10:31  dr0id: just don't understand whats happening, really frustrating, but when I fetch from DB and show on frontend it's fine, but the same info breaks xml S
10:31  courpse: ross`: header('Content-Type: text/javascript'); before outputting anything, and it'll be fine, :)
10:31  ross`: courpse: huh?
10:32  Fratyr: dr0id: maybe your xml is not utf8?
10:32  dr0id: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
10:32  vector_xyz: gvim is lacking the treebar of my files
10:32  dr0id: changing iso-8859-1 to UTF-8 doesn't fix it too
10:32  Fratyr: so It's not :p
10:32  vector_xyz: so not a good choice :)
10:32  ross`: courpse: you mean that would make it so it runs the php code when the function is called
10:32  ross`: not when the origional js is loaded
10:32  ross`: ?
10:32  courpse: ross`: That would make the file return in js format to your browser.
10:33  Fratyr: vector_xyz: use Eclipse and Git + SVN plug-ins. It will fit good in your team.
10:33  dr0id: Fratyr: read what I said?
10:33  courpse: So you can use <script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.php" />
10:33  Fratyr: dr0id: aha.. I see. I had this problem few years ago :\ can't remember the solution
10:34  dr0id: frustrated now :(
10:34 * DukeDrake too :(
10:34  Keloran: dr0id: theres a solution on htmlchars_decode or the htmlspecialchars page
10:35  dr0id: when I fetch on frontend from DB, I get Glam’eyes
10:35  Fratyr: dr0id: do you use "SET NAMES utf8" as sql query before you select data?
10:35  dr0id: but it breaks xml
10:35  Fratyr: oh
10:35  Altreus: print html_entity_decode('&rsquo;');  # &rsquo;
10:36  Altreus: Why :(
10:36  Fratyr: htmlentities
10:36  Keloran: dr0id: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.get-html-translation-table.phpits on there
10:36  Keloran: dr0id: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.get-html-translation-table.php its on there*
10:36  Altreus: what
10:36  grosboulet: Hello
10:37  Altreus: hang on did I just ask that question while someone else is asking the exact same question?
10:38  kent\n: Altreus: looks like a truth value..
10:38  Altreus: errr
10:38  Altreus: I'm so confused right now
10:38  dr0id: me too
10:39  Keloran: Altreus: you could also use that to do the translation, not sure if that specific char is listed on the examples though
10:39  Kako: Hi, I'm trying to work with SOAP, but in all Soap-answers de namespaces xsi and xsd are mising in the answer. Do anyone know if/where I can change the SOAPServer contructor or the WSDL so that this (unused) namespaces are printed in the result (Like it is been shown in all examples)? Here an example of my actual result an how I aspect it (http://soap.pastebin.org/151053)
10:39  dr0id: this is what I get on frontend -> http://codepad.org/T1EvAZb8
10:39  dr0id: Keloran: Fratyr: ^^
10:40  dr0id: http://codepad.viper-7.com/OZol5c confusing :-/
10:40  Fratyr: dr0id: when you put your code into xml file, use htmlentities() function on that problematic string
10:40  Fratyr: code = text*
10:40  dr0id: yes, I am using
10:41  Keloran: dr0id: that tells me that the output is broken
10:41  Fratyr: and you get something like &blabla; ?
10:41  dr0id: <title><?php echo htmlentities(strip_tags($row['name'])); ?></title>
10:41  dr0id: <description><?php echo htmlentities(strip_tags($row['content'])); ?></description>
10:42  Altreus: The answer was ENT_QUOTES
10:42  dr0id: this is what I can see in the source -> <title>Rimmel Glam&acirc;€™eyes Mascara Black</title>  anything starting from this is not diplayed on the pag
10:42  kent\n: wut
10:42  Keloran: dr0id: so im gona go with your setting the actual header of the xml page to be something otehr than UTF8, and also the data itself might be stored in its ascii form instead of its actual form
10:43  Keloran: dr0id: are you spitting the file into a static file, or presenting it through generation, becasue if its through generation then you will need to set the header to be UTF8 aswell as saying the file is UTF-8 encoding
10:43  bianchi: is there possibility to find out where (on disk) is located script that is currently executing?
10:44  Altreus: hooraaaaay
10:44  dr0id: generation
10:44  Altreus: that was like pulling my own teeth
10:44  Keloran: Altreus: i suggest a door for that, its fast and can be very satisifying to hear the slam, hehe
10:44 * f00li5h paws at Altreus and kent\n  
10:44  Altreus: Keloran: rm -rf comes to mind
10:45  Keloran: just dont do it with a swingdoor, that isnt pretty when you break your own nose on the rebound
10:45  kent\n: Altreus: go somewhere ethnic and use a slur at somebody weilding a baseball bat, then you can save yourself some effort =p
10:45  dr0id: Keloran: http://pastie.org/private/1ukqtkg2qleh0tljujvvkg
10:45 * Altreus calls kent\n an aussie
10:45  courpse: Altreus: Now now, no need to be nasty.
10:46 * kent\n gives Altreus dental surgery with an ion cannon.
10:46  Altreus: :3
10:46  Altreus: me and kent have this ionic bond
10:47  f00li5h: an ionic band? what do you play?
10:48  Altreus: fusion
10:48  kent\n: f00li5h: theramin
10:48  f00li5h: \o/
10:49  dr0id: how to fix this -> http://codepad.viper-7.com/z8KWlc ?
10:49  f00li5h: dr0id: paw at it
10:50  dr0id: weird, html_entity_decode fixes this
10:50  Keloran: dr0id: give it the correct header, give it the correct encoding
10:51  f00li5h: don't encode a string that's already encoded!
10:51  ss23: Unless you want to double encode it!
10:51  f00li5h: when is that helpful?
10:52  kent\n: extra  safety!
10:52  ss23: f00li5h: If someone says "I'll pay you $100 if you double encode this strong"
10:52  ss23: string*
10:52  ss23: :)
10:52  dr0id: haha :D
10:52  Adry: If I need to make a small, mostly static website, that is made of main page, sections (six or seven) and subsections (about 20), which all share header and footer, and all have a similar div with photo and text but different photo and text, and then in the middle all sections and subsections have a similar structure with different content (1 or 2 middle divs), do I need to use some templating technique or can I just use includes and pass content
10:52  Adry: in variables?
10:52 * f00li5h misses having nice things
10:52 * kent\n thinks you should also rot13 it, twice, just to be safe
10:52  ss23: f00li5h: Nice things like an IRC channel without me to mess around with people? :P
10:53  ss23: kent\n: Silly noob, he's done that!
10:53  ss23: If I didn't know better, I would say he's done it 4 times...
10:53  f00li5h: Adry: write a handler that will filla template based on the url its requested as.
10:54  f00li5h: Adry: mod_rewrite all rewuests to it, bull images/text from either flat files or a database
10:54  Adry: f00li5h, isn't that too much for a mostly static (80% of content) small website?
10:55  Adry: f00li5h, I also don't want to leave a client with something they can't grasp or whoever later takes on the project would have trouble with. It's for a small shop. I wanted to go with plain html, but then found it absurd to have to edit about 30 files separately. But don't won't to overdo on complexity either.
10:56  f00li5h: Adry: this makes less effort for you, while giving the customer what they are asking for
10:56  f00li5h: if you don t want to write code, don t ask coders
10:57  f00li5h: hmm, space next to '
10:57  kent\n: basic templating is a must, if you're editing 30 files for minor changes, you're DoingItWrong
10:57  kent\n: because what eventually happens is you forget to change *one* of those files
10:59  PiousMinion: Hi, I've got some code that takes a while to process (sending emails) so instead of calling it in the browser I add it to a queue file I created.  My question is, how do I then call my code that sends the mail without lagging the browser?
10:59  courpse: php -f filename.php ?
10:59  PiousMinion: If it was *n?x I'd use cron, but this a windows box.
11:00  f00li5h: PiousMinion: cron!
11:00  f00li5h: also. windoes has a sheddulething
11:00  courpse: No idea on windows.
11:00  courpse: yeah, it has task scheduling.
11:00  Adry: f00li5h, I was forgetting that a lot of irc is basically a role playing game. Happier now that you've fed your ego? Just because I have a hammer in my hand (AM a coder) doesn't mean I want to treat every problem like a nail.
11:00  courpse: But no idea where its located.
11:00  Adry: f00li5h, I used to do only php part in a team. Now have to do a much smaller project, but all on my own.
11:01  PiousMinion: f00li5h: Any idea how I'd call my code with  "?foo=bar" via command line?
11:01  Adry: f00li5h, and don't want to apply some random solution only because it's the default answer of your 'i'm so coder on irc' person.
11:01  f00li5h: Adry: you asked how i would do it, and this is how I *do* do it when asked to
11:01  Adry: f00li5h, thanks for your answer.
11:02  Adry: kent\n, and if you don't read the question before answering it, you are doing it wrong too.
11:03  f00li5h: Adry: what's your current solution?
11:03  f00li5h: PiousMinion: $args
11:03 @LawnGnome: Charming. Don't hurry back.
11:03  Keloran: lol
11:03  f00li5h: LawnGnome: help me so i can ridicule yourr solution!
11:04  f00li5h: shoudabeenincaps
11:04  PiousMinion: f00li5h: Well, my code is looking for $_GET['foo'].  Am I going to have to change my code because I'm calling from commandline or is there a way to make that work?
11:04  f00li5h: PiousMinion: it will have to stop doing that
11:04  Keloran: f00li5h: i need a way to punch someone in the face through IRC, hehe
11:04  ss23: PiousMinion: You could put a thing at the top that takes a $argv or w/e it is and sets a $_GET manually
11:04  f00li5h: or you could stuff things from $args into $_get.. but thats a bad idea
11:05  PiousMinion: ss23: code is simple enough to change is, I just don't want to. haha  thanks though  :P
11:05  f00li5h: PiousMinion: isn't eerything you need in your database queue anyway?
11:05  PiousMinion: yes
11:05  f00li5h: what is the get for then?
11:06  Xyphoid: if you want to use a query string as input to a CLI app you might want to look at parse_str
11:06  PiousMinion: f00li5h: if ($_GET['foo']==..) { do ..} elseif ($_GET['foo']==**) { do **}  etc
11:07  PiousMinion: One option add items to queue, another to actually process the queue (send mail).
11:07  f00li5h: seperate scripts or a subcommand type argument
11:08  f00li5h: mailinator add filename
11:08  f00li5h: mailinator run-queue
11:09  f00li5h: don't call it .php if you run it in a shell...
11:09  ss23: f00li5h: Why not?
11:09  ss23: Does it make a difference?
11:09  PiousMinion: ..?
11:09 * courpse is wondering the same.
11:09  courpse: How does that make a difference?
11:10  ss23: In fact, by not naming it .php, you're going to confuse people who haven't seen it before...
11:11  lewellyn: ss23: why?
11:11  lewellyn: that's what a shebang's for
11:11  f00li5h: ss23: think about the commands you rum... ls.o cd.sh id.py ... nope
11:11  lewellyn: setup.pl
11:11  lewellyn: ;)
11:12  Keloran: i suppose if your giving it a link in /usr/bin then yeah not naming it .php makes some sense, but really it makes no diffrence and worse unless you move it to that location instead of symlink-n it then people will delete the .php thinking its not relevant anymore
11:12  ss23: f00li5h: Scipts != binaries
11:12  ss23: if it' a script, you call it name.ext
11:12  lewellyn: Keloran: in any case, if someone's editing the thing and they don't see the #!/path/to/php at the top, they shouldn't be touching it.
11:12  ss23: If it's a binary, you ommit the ext
11:12  lewellyn: ss23: i bet your os doesn't do that
11:12  ss23: lewellyn: True, but it's still handy to see in a ls
11:12  f00li5h: ss23: and when does the person running it care about that?
11:13  ss23: lewellyn: Sorry, what do you mean?
11:13  lewellyn: ss23: no it's not. it just makes the output wider
11:13  Altreus: What's the best way of finding the response code given a URL that contains a GET parameter string?
11:13  f00li5h: i dont care if ls is written in ruby, as long as it lists files
11:13  ss23: lewellyn: Is too handy!
11:13  Altreus: the HTTP code
11:13  lewellyn: ss23: i bet you have plenty of things in $PATH which are scripts
11:13  f00li5h: Altreus: curl
11:13  ss23: "wtf is this Script, HOW CAN I KNOW WHAT LANGUAGE IT IS WITHOUT OPENING IT?! GOSH DARN!"
11:13  Altreus: f00li5h: -_-
11:13  lewellyn: ss23: file(1)
11:13  Altreus: I was hoping that was not the answer
11:13  ss23: Okay okay
11:14  ss23: I still think that a PHP script should be named .php
11:14  lewellyn: if you care, you'll do "file someprogramname"
11:14  lewellyn: ss23: so do that. let the sane people stay sane, though. ;)
11:14  lewellyn: i still bet that most of the stuff in your $PATH that is a script doesn't end in .pl, .py, .sh, whatever.
11:14  f00li5h: ss23: so, you accept the argument, but won't change your opinion?
11:15  f00li5h: smooth
11:15  lewellyn: including the language in the program's name limits your ability to replace it as easily later
11:15 @LawnGnome: Guys, the suffix debate is veering closer and closer to the religious. May I suggest moving on?
11:15  lewellyn: LawnGnome: it's not religious as much as "this is how things end up in fail-mode over time"
11:15  ss23: f00li5h: I accept that there's no consistent way so it's personal preference :3
11:16  vector_xyz: why is 'Assignment in an IF' considered a Warning in some IDEs ?
11:16 @LawnGnome: lewellyn: That may be. Move on anyway. :)
11:16  lewellyn: i HAVE seen things with names like configuration.sh which are python scripts
11:16  [mu]keiserr: btw ,is there some existing function in php so as after doing a file_get_contents, i can identify whether is a binary file or a text file [i.e ifi t was a text file which was strlent <some bytes, i would have displayed it in a textarea
11:16  f00li5h: [mu]keiserr: you should already know
11:17  f00li5h: guessing encodings is a bad plan
11:17  [mu]keiserr: yup
11:17 @LawnGnome: vector_xyz: Some people consider "if ($a = foo())" to be a poor coding pattern because of the potential for it being a typo of "if ($a == foo())". I tend to disagree, but that's the rationale.
11:17  [mu]keiserr: hmm maybe i should just write something that parses everything and see if there are only characters which are in the ascii range then
11:17  dr0id: Keloran: htmlspecialchars fixed it :S
11:17 --- Farkie[Away] is now known as Farkie
11:18 @LawnGnome: [mu]keiserr: You could probably use count_chars() as a starting point for that.
11:18  lewellyn: [mu]keiserr: what about... unicode? ;)
11:19  [mu]keiserr: hmm true indeed.. that would be a problem
11:22  enerel: how to count rows in mysql?
11:23  dr0id: is_file works for urls ?
11:23  enerel: i mean counting in which row current row exist?
11:23  lewellyn: enerel: not really a php question, but check the mysql docs for count()
11:25  dr0id: http://codepad.viper-7.com/iA9qT3 <-- why is it false? doesn't works for urls ?
11:27  Keloran: dont use that stuff over the internet
11:28 +Viper-7: dr0id: no, it wont work on urls, its why i've given you that check_url($url) function to use instead like 3 times :P
11:28  [mu]keiserr: ah ha :D to know if a file is readable [non binary] or not :p use regular expression thank god there is \u
11:29  dr0id: Viper-7: well, I am trying to do something different, I want to detect whether say example.com/rss.xml rss.xml is a file or not
11:29  dr0id: or is it going as an argument to an action to some controller in the MVC framework
11:29 +Viper-7: dr0id: sounds like you still want to check if a url returns a 200 or 404 response code
11:29 +Viper-7: ie, its a file, or it doesnt exist
11:29  dr0id: just wondering whether that's possible to know or not
11:30  dr0id: no no, for example. mystore.com/feeds/rss.xml <--- this is my url, rss.xml isn't any file :D
11:30  dr0id: so was just wondering whether I can detect whether rss.xml is a file or not from php
11:30 +Viper-7: no, its a url, which would output a generated file
11:30 +Viper-7: lol, no you cant tell shit about what the servers going to push that content out to you
11:30 +Viper-7: just that you got content.. or didnt
11:30 +Viper-7: lol whoops :P
11:30  dr0id: hehe :D
11:31  Altreus: When I use command-line curl, the -d option to send POST data becomes the option to send GET data if I use the -G option. Is this true of CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS too?
11:31 +Viper-7: dr0id: there are a few headers, like X-Powered-By and such, but they're hardly standard
11:32  dr0id: true
11:32  dr0id: Viper-7: trying to generate xml, htmlentities breaks it while htmlspecialchars doesn't , so does that means we should always use htmlspecialchars to generate xml(rss) from DB ?
11:33  Keloran: dr0id: you need to stop trying to make the ultimate CMS system that can do everything from control a newsletter to run a house, your going to be writing code till the end of time, design your systems to take advantage of php not try and make php do things it wont, and tell yoru clients to stop demanding hte earth, if they want everything they need to pay for it, then you can hire a consultant and get this
11:33  Keloran: info from them
11:33  ccapndave: Does anyone have a recomendation for a good PHP framework to use to make a webservice?
11:34 +Viper-7: dr0id: if you encode an entire xml file with htmlentities or htmlspecialchars, they'll both break it. if you encode the CONTENT thats going into a field in an xml file with them (which is what they're built for), then neither should break it
11:34  dr0id: yeah, am encoding the content only
11:34 +Viper-7: unless your content contains characters other than < > ' which are important to your xml parser
11:34  dr0id: with htmlspecialchars, as htmlentities is breaking it :S
11:34 +Viper-7: in which case htmlentities() should work
11:34  Keloran: ccapndave: we dont recommend 3rd party stuff
11:34 +Viper-7: htmlspecialchars() will fail (it wont encode the extra elements)
11:35  dr0id: and htmlentities encodes the extra elements breaking the xml :S
11:35 +Viper-7: dr0id: i call lies
11:35 +Viper-7: either you arent sending the charset to htmlentities() and are expecting it to work with utf-8 content or such
11:35  ccapndave: Keloran: Oh ok.  Is there a better channel to ask?
11:35  dr0id: Viper-7: 1 sec
11:35 +Viper-7: or.. you made a mistake :D
11:37  dr0id: Viper-7: http://pastie.org/private/60mqktwnsysx8fm6xlwk6q
11:37  Keloran: ccapndave: not really each channel is specific to it, so thye will say there own, #web might be able to answer, but thats a guess, but in here we dont recommend because it becomes a holy war
11:37 +Viper-7: dr0id: save the output using htmlentities, and save the output using htmlspecialchars - then compare
11:38  dr0id: htmlentities broke it, htmlspecialchars fixed it heh :D
11:38 +Viper-7: dr0id: htmlentities just outputs "broke" hey? :P
11:38  dr0id: error on line 659 at column 27: Entity 'rsquo' not defined
11:38  ccapndave: Keloran: I understand :)  Cheers
11:38 +Viper-7: im sure theres more to the problem than you're aware, you need debugging
11:38  Altreus: nope I still can't figure out how to send simple GET data to a URL using curl. I've tried http://url/?get=data, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS = "get=data" and CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS = array( get => data ) using CURLOPT_HTTPGET = true
11:38  dr0id: that's not the only error, but I go to DB fix 1, and then get another driving me crazy
11:38 +Viper-7: *aware of
11:39  Altreus: Nothing is producing the same result as `curl -G -d get=data http://url`
11:39  ddog: im very new to php and have a small question, what is the key in an array? is it $ddog[hey] = "is this the key?" ?
11:39  Altreus: ddog: the key is the thing by which you access the data later
11:39  Altreus: i.e. 'hey'
11:39 +Viper-7: dr0id: rsquo is a valid html entity, but probably not in the document you're using (iirc its a utf-8 entity)
11:39 +Viper-7: dr0id: how are you loading this document? ie whats throwing that error ?
11:39  bartzy__: Hi
11:39  ddog: okey thanks
11:40  dr0id: Viper-7: can I show you the actual link on PM ?
11:40  bartzy__: Inserting an "object" into the DB (PDO), should be done in a function inside the object, or actually where I need to insert ?
11:40  rednblue: hey .. i am in need of php api interview question.. just got a call for an interview.. in 3 hours
11:40  totouser: hi i am using PHP 5.2.6-1+lenny but __autoload is not call in somme cases
11:40  bartzy__: I'm talking best practice , right & wrong... both will work
11:40 +Viper-7: dr0id: no thanks
11:40  Keloran: bartzy__: inserting an object into the database ?, why are you trying to store an object in the database
11:40  totouser: is there any explication for that?
11:41  dr0id: Viper-7: in chrome I get that error, also when I validate the xml I get the error
11:41 +Viper-7: dr0id: just use htmlspecialchars
11:41  Keloran: dr0id: have you tried settign the header to be utf-8 ?
11:41  dr0id: the code is same as I showed you (the pastie link -> http://pastie.org/private/60mqktwnsysx8fm6xlwk6q )
11:41 +Viper-7: dr0id: htmlentities != xmlentities, (there isnt one), your xml document doesnt have the namespaces and schema required to allow UTF-8 html entities in its content
11:41  bartzy__: Keloran: I'm not, I'm casting it into an array. I just want to know if it's general practice to create a function inside the class that INSERTS the object into the DB ? or should I just write the PDO code where I need it ?
11:41  Keloran: {swear i said that an hour ago}
11:42 +Viper-7: xml's dont have headers heh
11:42  thnee: installing php with apache 2.2 module on windows, produces this config: http://pastebin.com/Q9eJhvrC  but makes apache crash upon startup and not write anything to error log
11:42 +Viper-7: or <meta> tags for the content type ;)
11:42  dr0id: Keloran: don't know how to do that
11:42  dr0id: but I have this -> header('Content-type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8');
11:42  Keloran: bartzy__: sorry your question is confusing me
11:43  rednblue: please please some one help on "php api"  interview questions....
11:44  Keloran: rednblue: we cant answer a question you havent asked
11:44  Keloran: rednblue: so the answer is "a wizard did it"
11:44  dr0id: rednblue: why take a job? do freelancing lol
11:44  bartzy__: Keloran: Lets say I have a User class. I want to insert a newly created object User into the DB... Meaning the user's details. Should I do it in a function inside the User class ? Is that considered good practice ?
11:45  rednblue: dr0id:  i cud hav.. as m getting freelance jobs.. but the clients here pay a lot less.. need to get experience on advanced php.. i cant do it of my own..
11:45  dr0id: yes you can do on ##php becoming a channel vampire like me lol
11:45  dr0id: here ? where ?
11:46  rednblue: Keloran:  hmm :( i hav no idea of php api..
11:46  Keloran: bartzy__: thats whats confusing my why are you trying to put the object into the database, why not put the values relevant to the user into the database, e.g. username would go into the database but $user->username doesnt
11:47 +Viper-7: Keloran: hes asking if he should embed SQL queries into his models (from what i can tell)
11:47  dr0id: rednblue: even I have no idea what you are trying to mean by "php api" but they should be nothing complicated, plain function calls, post with curl and get info, simple :)
11:47  Keloran: ahh, that makes more sense, thought i was going mad
11:47  bartzy__: Viper-7: CORRECT ! :)
11:47  bartzy__: lol
11:47  bartzy__: sorry for being unclear
11:47 +Viper-7: bartzy__: the simplest common solution, is to provide static methods that contain the real sql, and wrap them in object methods
11:47 +Viper-7: so $foo->Save(); would internally call self::save($this->ID);
11:47  bartzy__: meaning should I have a function insert_user_into_db() inside my User Class ?
11:48  bartzy__: Viper-7: Why use static methods ?
11:48  dr0id: I usually have it in my Model_User
11:48  dr0id: Class Model_user :P
11:48 +Viper-7: bartzy: because then they arent scoped to any specific object instance, you have methods specific to a user, like $user->setName('bob'); and methods that work across all users, ie User::save($user);
11:48  thnee: enabling the php_curl.dll extension makes apache crash with no error message what so ever..?
11:50 +Viper-7: bartzy: its a separation of logic thing. a User instance itself should contain the properties (or fields) associated with a user, and methods to interact with those properties, and add business logic ( eg $user->approve() )
11:50  Keloran: thnee: did you install curl seperatlly or as part of a WAMP script ?
11:50  bartzy__: So the static methods gets an object instance ?
11:50  thnee: Keloran: no
11:50  thnee: Keloran: i installed PHP
11:50  PiousMinion: Does php-cli output errors to the error log defined in php.ini ?
11:50  Keloran: did you install the correct one ?
11:50  bartzy__: Viper-7 see my question above ^ :)
11:50  thnee: Keloran: i installed the latest one
11:50  Keloran: thnee: theres 2 for windows (for each release)
11:51  thnee: Keloran: actually there are more than tw
11:51 +Viper-7: Bartzy_: a class defines an object, and provides a static scope to hold methods & variables that are NOT specific to any single object
11:51  thnee: Keloran: are you suggesting i should use the non-thread-safe one instead?
11:51  bartzy__: Viper-7: Also, how could the class have 1 static method called Save and other not static method (wrapper) called "Save" too ?
11:51 +Viper-7: an object is a collection of methods & properties, that represent a real world object or similar
11:51  Keloran: thnee: fair enough, i never isntall php on windows, just going though the usual questions
11:51  bartzy__: Viper-7: Yes I understand that
11:51  thnee: Keloran: this is what i used PHP 5.2.14 installer [20,877Kb] - 22 July 2010
11:52  thnee: Keloran: the msi package, that is referenced in the .zip package
11:52  bartzy__: Viper-7: I just asked if the static method Save (that does the actual DB work) gets an object instance of the class as a paramater
11:52 +Viper-7: bartzy__: yep, thats the idea
11:52  bartzy__: Viper-7: Because $this is not available in static methods
11:52 +Viper-7: bartzy__: User::save() - the static method - doesnt apply to any single user. so you need to pass it an object to interact with
11:53 +Viper-7: hence the wrapper would call User::save($this)
11:53  bartzy__: Viper-7: OK, and how come in your example there are 2 "Save" methods ? 1 static and 1 wrapper (not static) ?
11:53 +Viper-7: my bad, i added that ->ID in my first example - wrongly
11:53  Keloran: Viper-7: i think you opened a can of worms now, lol
11:53  bartzy__: Viper-7: Yes that's what confused me. thanks for the clarficiation.
11:53  Keloran: rednblue: do you have a specific question ?
11:53  bartzy__: Keloran: Why ? :)
11:54  bartzy__: Viper-7: I still don't fully undrestand the logic of not writing the actual DB work inside a regular method.
11:55 +Viper-7: bartzy__: whatever naming.. usually my naming conventions are actually like User::save_object() and $user->Write();
11:55 +Viper-7: bartzy__: in this context - it does little more than to FORCE you to scope your db handling code to the class rather than to an object
11:55  Keloran: its just better practice
11:55 +Viper-7: bartzy__: this doesnt make a huge impact on smple systems, but in large systems you'll quickly port that logic out into a Factory
11:56 +Viper-7: which then gives you the power to use different db engines, swap sql implementations (for unit testing, dev environment, etc)
11:56  ddog: hey guys i have one more question, if i like to build a very easy cms do u know any guides i could read? have been searching @ google but did not find anything good
11:57 +Viper-7: bartzy__: it also helps to look from the other perspective. it keeps your model object instances clean. they do nothing apart from hold data, and provide methods to interact with that data
11:57 +Viper-7: they dont connect to the database, run raw sql, escape/bind parameters, etc
11:58  Keloran: ddog: there is no such thing as a "simple cms" people will always want more funcs, and if not planed properlly from the start it will very quickly become either broken or just a plain mess
11:59  bartzy__: Viper-7: Correct, but with simple User::save_object($my_user_obj) you can access what you want
11:59  bartzy__: or just $my_user_obj->write()
11:59 +Viper-7: bartzy__: yup
11:59  bartzy__: Viper-7: I'll go with what you said... It sounds reasonable :)
12:00 +Viper-7: bartzy__: it also makes $user = new User(); $user->name = 'Bob'; $user->write(); a little cleaner semantically
12:00  Keloran: ddog: but if you use a framework and you follow the methods set by it, you can add funcs without having to replan at the start
12:00  bartzy__: Viper-7: Thanks a lot for your help and patience.
12:00 +Viper-7: you dont need to worry about injecting a database connection into the instance and such, - you know its all managed statically
12:00 +Viper-7: np
12:00  ddog: okey thanks for answer, what do u thnk is the best way to learn php then? im reading "beginning PHP and MySQL from novice to pro" with jason gilmore atm, should i just read the book and then start do things?
12:00  bartzy__: Viper-7: Now when I have DB rows that represent users, lets say I want to get all users from the DB... But I want to have a view_user() method for the user class... how can I do that ?
12:01  Keloran: ddog: the bot has a very good 101 for learning php, i have no idea what its keyword is, Viper-7 might know
12:01 +Viper-7: ddog: http://devzone.zend.com/article/627
12:01  bartzy__: Viper-7: About the DB connection, I thought that I'd just create a PDO instance for my entire classes file... Is that wrong ?
12:01  ddog: thanks guys =)
12:02 +Viper-7: bartzy__: well you need to get access to that instance somehow, there are many options - dependency injection, registry pattern, singleton pattern, globals
12:02 +Viper-7: i'd try and stick to the first 2 in that list ;)
12:02  Keloran: (joke) everyone knows globals are the future
12:03 +Viper-7: bartzy__: as for view_user(), i'd apply the same factory pattern, again statically. $users = User::get('Age > 18'); foreach($users as $user) { $user->playBall(); }
12:03  Keloran: ive got a fun task this week, i have to read all the code in our codebase (only about 40k lines of code) and write comments for it, so we can migrate the code, lol
12:04 +Viper-7: lol
12:04  dr0id: Viper-7: a project for you -> http://www.scriptlance.com/projects/1286801192.shtml lol :P
12:05 +Viper-7: Keloran: thats semantic commenting too heh, those kinds of comments are "statements of intent" or "goals", not an explanation of the code
12:05 +Viper-7: how fun -_-
12:05 +Viper-7: lol budget $10-200
12:05  dr0id: lol
12:05  bartzy__: Viper-7: How User::get('Age > 18') should santize this ? It's going to the WHERE right ?
12:06 +Viper-7: bartzy__: there isnt a need to sanitize in this case, theres no user input or special characters involved
12:06  Keloran: exactlly, "this creates a user", "@todo rename from deleteUser to createUser" that kinda stuff, and that one isnt actually a joke, the function was actually called "destroyUser" and actually did "INSERT INTO user..."
12:06 +Viper-7: bartzy__: each db layer will have its own methods, i far prefer parameterization
12:06  bartzy__: Viper-7: Correct, but there will be in some case
12:06  bartzy__: Viper-7: What do you mean parameterization ?
12:06 +Viper-7: ie User::get('Age > :age', array('age' => 18))
12:06  bartzy__: Oh that's good.
12:07 +Viper-7: bartzy__: in PDO, i mean using bindParam or passing an array to execute()
12:07 +Viper-7: (under the hood that is)
12:07  bartzy__: That's very good approach
12:07  bartzy__: Viper-7: And then you build the WHERE clause according to what you defined ?
12:08  bartzy__: "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE " . $param1 . .....
12:08  bartzy__: ?
12:08 +Viper-7: bartzy__: yup, in that example the static get method is providing almost ORM level of automation, ie User::get($where, $join, $group, $order, $having).. it depends how far you want to go
12:08 +Viper-7: you can easily just embed the where clause or such
12:09 +Viper-7: or just a chunk of raw sql (after SELECT .. FROM ..)
12:09 +Viper-7: ie User::get('WHERE Age > :age', array('age' => 18))
12:09 +Viper-7: bartzy__: often i'll build cleaner static helper methods instead
12:09 +Viper-7: ie User::get_by_age(18)
12:10  bartzy__: Viper-7: get_by_age uses User::get ?
12:10  asmcad: is it possibile to use variable between different php tags. like something this :  <?php $smth = 'smth'; ?> <?php echo $smth ?>
12:10 +Viper-7: internally yup
12:10  bartzy__: Viper-7: Great.
12:10 +Viper-7: just automates the query building
12:10  ss23: Until you get User::get_by_age_last_week_admin_child_of_user_5
12:10 +Viper-7: ^
12:10 +Viper-7: thats there the versatility of a generic method comes into its own, but it really does depend on the system you're building
12:10  bartzy__: Viper-7: And you don't call User::get & foreach $users.. from your actual class or instanciated object right ? You do it just when you need to view the objects  ?
12:10 +Viper-7: anything short of large-to-massive, i wouldnt be too worried
12:11  bartzy__: ss23: lol
12:11 +Viper-7: bartzy__: i'd usually be making that call in the controller yeah
12:11  ss23: Or you can do User::get_by_age->filterByDate('bla'); or something, if you're that way inclined
12:11  bartzy__: Viper-7: So the controller will have foreach($users) in the code ? No other abstractions there ? :)
12:11  ss23: Filtering after getting from SQL is kind of ineffiecent though
12:11 +Viper-7: bartzy: the controller would probably pass $users straight on to the template
12:11 +Viper-7: depending on the use case
12:12  bartzy__: Viper-7: Makes sense.
12:12 +Viper-7: iterating and accessing properties is simple, safe & clean enough to do from there
12:12  bartzy__: Viper-7: So the User class should have a method to output stuff in the view_user method ? or the template should do that completely ?
12:13  ross`: hey um
12:13  ross`: somethign really weird is going on
12:13  ross`: for some reason i think a file is getting included twice, but i've checked everything its not
12:13  Fratyr: Is there a way to check if string is encoded by base64?
12:13  ross`: http://foo.mx/
12:13  ross`: for NO reason it displays the topnav twice
12:14 +Viper-7: bartzy__: you should either access properties of each user directly in your template, ie echo $user->Name; but if you like you could also give a User its own entire template, and give the User objects a render() or forTemplate() or such method
12:14  Fratyr: ross`: show full code
12:14 +Viper-7: you can even do a really nice implementation of that using __invoke() in 5.3
12:14  bartzy__: Viper-7: So from what I understand (and what makes the most sense to me), the class should never have any kind of presentation (CSS , html whatever) in it ? It should only provide a clean way for the controller to get an array of objects by some filter (from a DB for example), which then passes this array of objects to a template that does whatever it wants with it ?
12:14  ross`: Fratyr: you have it..
12:14  PiousMinion: Is there anything wrong with storing data as a serialized multi-dimentinal array in a file... or should I learn SQLite?
12:14  ross`: its over many files, but that source is it
12:14  ross`: except i cant explain the last part
12:14  ross`: its just not in any file
12:14  ross`: @.@
12:15  ross`: i have this code on header.php to include topnav.php
12:15  Fratyr: ross`: the php code that generates this
12:15  ddog: ross u have made <div id="topnav" at the end of u code
12:15  ross`: which has <div id="topnav">topnav</div>
12:15  ross`: ddog: im telling you, i havt
12:15  Kako: Hi, do anyone know how I can add additional namespace declarations on the Response of a "SoapServer::SoapServer"? Must this be done in the class-contructor or in the wsdl? Like shown in my example (http://soap.pastebin.org/151053) I'm missing  xmlns:xsi and xmlns:xsd in the Envelope.
12:15 +Viper-7: bartzy__: your models should have two DISTINCT sections, being static code responsible for the CRUD process, and member functions/properties providing the business / display logic (no html/css/whatever)
12:15  ross`: <? include_once('topnav.php'); ?>
12:15  Fratyr: show guts of index.php header.php and topnav.php
12:15  ross`: i have that on header.php
12:15  ross`: topnav.php is only one line
12:15 +Viper-7: bartzy__: your controller is responsible for fetching the right things and passing them to the view, so thats easy now
12:16  ross`: index.php doesnt have any html on it at all
12:16 +Viper-7: then the view (the template) renders those elements
12:16  ross`: and header.php only has that include line once
12:16  ross`: and the home module doesnt have any source in it besides home
12:16  Fratyr: ross`: you should understand that php is what generates this topnav twice, so showing only html wont give us any useful info to help you
12:16  ross`: thats why this is freaking me out
12:16  bartzy__: Viper-7: So the view can do $obj->getDiscountedPrice() or $user->getFullName() right ? Because sometimes I want to use the object's methods to get useful data.
12:16  ross`: its just not there
12:16  ross`: Fratyr: alright fine
12:16  ross`: Fratyr: but it wont help
12:17  Fratyr: lets see
12:17 +Viper-7: bartzy__: correct. try to limit the complexity of the methods you call from the views - for instance $orders = $user->getAllHistoricalOrders(); isnt a line i'd like to see inside a view or template, it goes in the controller instead
12:17 +Viper-7: but generally, thats it :)
12:17  bartzy__: Viper-7: OK. I don't have a controller and view correcntly...
12:17  bartzy__: :
12:18  bartzy__: :\
12:18  ross`: ok
12:18  ross`: Fratyr: http://foo.mx/src
12:18  bartzy__: Just a classes file and the actual file that the users see... Is there a simple way to create a controller/view model without a framework ?
12:18  Keloran: ross`: you should really use <?php not <?
12:18 +Viper-7: bartzy__: i think i have some very basic code lying around, sec
12:19  bartzy__: Viper-7: Thanks.
12:19  ross`: Keloran: thanks for the hint
12:19  ross`: i dont ever plan on using this source on a system that requires it tho
12:19  Fratyr: ross`: what's in $header and $footer vars? print_r them
12:19  ross`: now
12:19 +Viper-7: bartzy__: ok i do - its not the IDEAL because i'm using the singleton pattern here (and for a database! shame on me!) but it covers much of what we've discussed
12:19 +Viper-7: http://home.viper-7.com/trac/browser/PHP/Snippets/basicmvc.php
12:20  ross`: Fratyr: simply header.php
12:20  ross`: and footer.php
12:20  bartzy__: Viper-7: Sorry for all the irritating questions, but one more : You said that my classes should have DISTINCT sections of static methods and regular methods .... It's just seperating in the code right ? Declraing properties first, then __consruct function, then static functions and then member f unctions ?
12:20  ross`: which is empty atm
12:20  Fratyr: print_r !
12:20  Fratyr: and $footer as well
12:20  ross`: Fratyr: ok, ill check
12:20 +Viper-7: bartzy__: you should see in that code of mine, in that, the methods that would be static against the User class, have been broken out into their very own UserFactory class
12:20 +Viper-7: thats the "next step" i was talking about
12:21  ross`: thank you problem solved
12:21 +Viper-7: you can use static methods instead - its really just a cheat... a timesaver. - but if you can keep that clean separation between the methods that handle the CRUD process, and your business logic, it gives you room to move later
12:21  Fratyr: ross`: what it was?
12:21 +Viper-7: and yes, when i say separation there, i mean give the methods a static keyword, and group them together in the file, nothing elaborate
12:22  Fratyr: wrong content in vars?
12:23  ross`: i've been using nano to text edit, and i've been copying lines with ctrl+k and ctrl+u and anyway i forgot to rename the topnav declaration to $topnav
12:23  ross`: so there was two $footers
12:23  ross`: one with the link to $footer
12:23  ross`: and one with the link to $topnav
12:23  bartzy__: Viper-7: OK, I'm reading it :)
12:24  bartzy__: Viper-7: Again, thanks so much for the help
12:24  Keloran: copy-paste teh bain of the coding world
12:24 +Viper-7: bartzy__: all good ;)
12:24  bartzy__: Viper-7: What's __CLASS__ ? :)
12:24 +Viper-7: however i do pretty much have to stop it there ;) got other stuff to do
12:24 +Viper-7: bartzy__: http://php.net/__CLASS__
12:24 +Viper-7: rofl that doesnt even work :S
12:25  bartzy__: Viper-7: OK , thanks :)
12:25 +Viper-7: bartzy__: get_class($this)
12:25 +Viper-7: == __CLASS__
12:26  bartzy__: understood
12:26  bartzy__: And why is this line needed ?
12:26  bartzy__: if(!isset(self::$instance)) {
12:26 +Viper-7: bartzy__: both of those are related to the singleton pattern
12:26 +Viper-7: theres tons of docs on that, read one and you should follow it
12:26  bartzy__: OK... you said that singleton pattern is not good here ?
12:27  bartzy__: Oh I understand - only 1 object of the DB class should be instanciated...
12:27 +Viper-7: its not ideal - using a singleton for a database is convenient, but it means you CANNOT connect to a second database using the same class (you cant create a 2nd instance)
12:27 +Viper-7: using a registry pattern is basically just as convenient, and much cleaner
12:27 +Viper-7: which is what i often use
12:28 +Viper-7: and the best solution is "dependency injection"
12:28 +Viper-7: plenty of keywords for google there ;)
12:28  Keloran: hehe
12:28 +Viper-7: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-php-designptrns/
12:28 +Viper-7: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-php-designpatterns/
12:28 +Viper-7: both of those are links i'd trust to some docs on design patterns
12:30  bartzy__: OK, thanks a lot :)
12:36  bartzy__: Viper-7: lol, I just saved the entire channel conversation since I joined to a text file.. very helpful
12:36 +Viper-7: haha ;)
12:36  bartzy__: I'm currently creating a PDO instance from a simple included file (db.php)... Is that VERY wrong ?
12:37 +Viper-7: where does it put the instance ?
12:37  bartzy__: global $dbh :\
12:37  Keloran: *shudders*
12:37 +Viper-7: heh
12:37 +Viper-7: well at the very least look into the registry pattern
12:37  bartzy__: Why is that so bad ? :)
12:38 +Viper-7: storing it in a registry is much better
12:38  bartzy__: I understand it's bad (from every where I'm reading that global namespacing is bad) but I don't fully understand why.
12:39  Keloran: it can be overwritten at a moments notice, it relys to much on storing thigns in memory that shoudlnt be, if you want something to use it either give it to the function or the class, dont rely on magic to have something pulled out of thin air
12:39 +Viper-7: bartzy__: theres no hooks to override, patch, dummy up, etc global variables, they only have one value, and they always apply script-wide. plus, you have no hook to see if/when something is reading that global value - which can be a debugging nightmare
12:39 +Viper-7: bartzy__: the best solution is dependency injection
12:40  bartzy__: what do you mean hooks to override ? override what ?
12:40  bartzy__: Viper-7: Yeah I'm reading up on design patterns
12:40  bartzy__: So I'll guess I'll be (a bit) wiser soon
12:40 +Viper-7: bartzy__: the best example is unit testing
12:40  bartzy__: :)
12:42 +Viper-7: to test a class, a common ploy is to dummy up either some data, or a database object instance that'll provide some data, and test using that
12:42 +Viper-7: the latter can be really cool if done correctly
12:42 +Viper-7: but only possible with dependency injection, or a registry with a slew of added features
12:47  ajavid: silence of the lambs
12:48  silv3r_m00n: hi there , I need to add some functionality to a class , so should I add some extra methods to it or subclass it and over ride some existing methods ?
12:48  ajavid: silv3r_m00n, what functionality?
12:48  silv3r_m00n: there is a function insert  , and I need to add another function called multi_insert
12:49  silv3r_m00n: so shud I add multi_insert to same class or subclass it and over ride insert and put in the code for multi_insert over there
12:49  ajavid: I would just subclass it and keep the multiple insertion function in a seperate object (depending on how often it needs to be instantiated unless its a static method)
12:50  ajavid: though some people would argue that these are related insert functions and should be put into one object
12:50  pea[1]: does md5_file use a lot of resources?
12:50  ajavid: if you need to use different kinds of multiple insertion it would obviously make more sense to subclass so you can polymorphize if you need at some point
12:51  silv3r_m00n: ajavid: I won't need multiple kinds
12:51  ajavid: so I might subclass in order to keep that option open (feature creep)
12:51  ajavid: put it into that original class then, keep it simple
12:51  silv3r_m00n: but insert and multi insert both may be needed in some cases
12:52  silv3r_m00n: then I need to keep both in same class
12:52  ajavid: mhmm
12:53  ajavid: I suffer from heartburn right now :(
12:53  silv3r_m00n: acidity ?
12:53  ajavid: I dunno, I woke up at 5am with massive heartburn
12:53  ajavid: drank some milk, now im waiting
12:53  silv3r_m00n: take some pudina , it would help in acidity
12:53  ajavid: I don't have any at the house
12:54  ajavid: I think we put the last of it into the aaloo gosht
12:54  silv3r_m00n: hmm
12:54  silv3r_m00n: then send a servant to get some
12:54  ajavid: I don't have a butler yet.
12:55  ajavid: I have maid that comes in twice a week, but not butler to buttle for me just yet
12:55  ajavid: I would love to have my own personal butler one day
12:55  ross`: can someone help me, this function doesnt work properly..
12:55  ross`: http://foo.mx/src/topnav
12:55  markskilbeck: ross`: define 'doesn't work'.
12:56  ajavid: markskilbeck, i think it sits on the couch all day and proscrastinates and doesn't have a friggin job! that dang function
12:56  ross`: it doesnt echo '<a href="$pubfile">$module</a> '; for each item it finds in the database
12:56  ajavid: :)
12:56  markskilbeck: Probably because you have no results.
12:57  markskilbeck: Is the topnav column holding an integer value?
12:57  markskilbeck: If it's not a string, remove those quotes around the 1.
12:58  ross`: markskilbeck: ty
12:59  ross`: markskilbeck: for some reason that function doesnt allow chrome to display the page
12:59  ross`: idk why tho
13:00  ross`: according to w3schools that while loop will echo that content for every row it finds
13:00  ross`: that matches topnav = 1
13:00  ross`: markskilbeck: right/
13:00  markskilbeck: ross`: try http://pastie.org/1215120
13:01  chouchou: hello good mornign, in php.ini, is this timezone correct? date.timezone = "Australia/Perth"
13:01  ross`: markskilbeck: ok
13:02  chouchou: I mean teh syntax?
13:02  Tricks: how do i reference a sub class from within a static class in the parent?
13:02  Tricks: is it new class
13:02  chouchou: any answer pls ?
13:03  ross`: markskilbeck: thank you, it works perfect or it will :)
13:03  ross`: it displays correctly wrong information xD
13:04  enerel: anyone know good php ping script?
13:04  markskilbeck: chouchou: yes.
13:04  chouchou: thanks
13:05  Tricks: enerel, what are you trying to achieve? Response time or to check if a server is up?
13:06  ross`: markskilbeck: something a little more complicated.. how would i have it show a | at the end of every echo but the LAST one
13:06  ross`: or is that impossible
13:06  enerel: Tricks: if the server is up
13:07  Tricks: try this : http://php.net/manual/en/function.fsockopen.php
13:07  Tricks: enerel, ^
13:08  ajavid: tricks, hmm
13:08  enerel: Tricks: i am using that but it is not working for some sites for ex: http://xopom.com
13:08  markskilbeck: ross`: it's possible - not sure what DBAL you're using though.
13:08  enerel: in windows command ping is working and the site is also
13:08  markskilbeck: ross`: you'd simply check if there were more records to come, and if so, append '|' to the output.
13:08  enerel: but fsockopen cannot check it
13:08  Tricks: enerel, ah I used it to make sure a service was running on a server
13:08  enerel: what is wrong with that domain?
13:09  Tricks: enerel, thing is a server may respond to ping but that doesn't mean the service is running
13:09  Tricks: enerel, which is why fsockopen is good because you can tell it which port the server listens on
13:09  enerel: Tricks: i use this function http://pastebin.com/Z22h0Z2h
13:10  Tricks: enerel, server / service
13:10  enerel: but the website is working from browser
13:11  enerel: that means the service is running right
13:12  Tricks: enerel, line 7 doesn't look right
13:13  enerel: i also want to check if either 80 or 8080 is working
13:13  Tricks: missing {}
13:13  enerel: okay
13:14  Tricks: enerel, you could use cURL to check http headers, that's another alternative if you're wanting to check only webserver
13:14  markskilbeck: Line 7 is fine.
13:14  courpse: line 7 looks fine to me too.
13:14  chouchou: pls is there any channel for PEAR on freenode ?
13:14  markskilbeck: Curly braces can be omitted.
13:14  enerel: for some websites it does not work
13:15  enerel: but for most it works
13:15  Tricks: markskilbeck, ah i didn't know that :)
13:15  enerel: i dont know why
13:15  Tricks: use cURL
13:15  Tricks: then
13:15  markskilbeck: chouchou: #pear @ efnet
13:15  enerel: cURL is it better?
13:15  Tricks: it's quicker and acts as a browser would
13:15  Tricks: yeah it's a relatively new class I believe
13:16  enerel: kewl
13:16  Tricks: google it there's loads of info I used it to do page scraping a while back
13:16  enerel: like crawling?
13:16  Tricks: but there's a way of checking http response codes
13:16  Tricks: yeah
13:17  enerel: hey guys is it bad to do crawling?
13:18  Tricks: enerel, I don't see how it's bad. The information is there it's just I'm not going to every page myself and getting the info
13:18  Tricks: enerel, PHP does it for me whilst I go for a fag :P
13:19  Tricks: ok I got told off by php bot for using that word lol
13:20  Tricks: anyway enerel try cURL I think it'll be fine for what you wanna do :) So much quicker as well
13:20  enerel: hehe
13:20  enerel: roger that
13:22  mikunos: hi guys how have I get recursively the category_id of these two item: [Low Budjet, Business]? http://pastie.org/1215147
13:22  ross`: markskilbeck: hehehe, this is actually a pretty good system i have going here
13:22  ross`: markskilbeck: i have it so it shows all items with topnav = 1 and order by topnav_order :)
13:22  mikunos: I would like to create a function that check if an item exist and return me the category_id
13:22  ross`: markskilbeck: and all items have a default of 999 int(3) for topnav order
13:23  ross`: so i manually set 1 2 3 etc
13:23  silv3r_m00n: I want the first element of a associative array
13:23  mikunos: I don't understand how where I have to start
13:23  silv3r_m00n: how ?
13:23  mikunos: any idea?
13:23  courpse: silv3r_m00n: reset() ?
13:24  silv3r_m00n: not reset exactly , just the first element
13:24  silv3r_m00n: no iteration has been done yet
13:24  courpse: reset() gives the first item in an array.
13:24  courpse: end() gives the last.
13:24  silv3r_m00n: oh gr8
13:27  mikunos: anyone?
13:28  saje: Be more specific, mikunos.
13:28  mikunos: saje:how have I get recursively the category_id of these two item: [Low Budjet, Business]? http://pastie.org/1215147
13:29  saje: mikunos, on what bassis are these tow specific items selected for returning
13:29  saje: two*
13:29  courpse: Is this comming a database?
13:29  mikunos: saje, ????
13:29  saje: courpse, on what basis are these two specific items selected for returning
13:30  courpse: I _think_ he knows the item name, and wants to get cat id that matches.
13:30  saje: mikunos, if you can't explain the goal of the function to me, no wonder you can't explain it to a computer
13:30  saje: is the name the criteria, mikunos?
13:31  mikunos: saje, I would like to extract a group of ID from the multidimensional array
13:31  mikunos: is it clear?
13:33  silv3r_m00n: I need the pointer to the first element of an array
13:33  silv3r_m00n: $set =& reset(&$this->input_fields);  doesn't work
13:33  thnee: some extensions, such as php_curl.dll and php_exif.dll, and all the database drivers, makes Apache (on windows) crash upon startup without any error message. whats up with that?
13:33  silv3r_m00n: changing $set doesn't effect $this->input_fields
13:33  saje: function MATCH ($criteria, $item) { $matches = array(); if (isset($item['children']) foreach ($item['children'] as $subItem) $matches = array_merge($matches, MATCH($criteria, $subItem)); if (in_array($item['name'], $criteria)) $matches[] = $item['category_id']; return $matches; }
13:33  prgmrBill: I hope you don't expect anyone to try and read that
13:34  courpse: lol.
13:34  saje: mikunos, ^ you can optimize and avoid array_merge by passing array pointed with matches.
13:34  thnee: silv3r_m00n: only safe way is foreach + break, since reset() doesnt work with iterators
13:34  thnee: silv3r_m00n: but if youre defining youre array yourself, reset should return the first element
13:34  saje: mikunos, you can avoid the entire ordeal if you select directly from the database you use, as courpse suggested.
13:35  saje: array pointed = I mean array pointer, i.e. reference
13:35  mikunos: let me try it
13:35  courpse: mikunos: Are you getting that info from a database?
13:35  saje: mikunos, try to understand it instead.
13:35  mikunos: saje: the source is a xml file
13:36  courpse: ahh kk.
13:36  saje: mikunos, see SAX and XMLReader.
13:36  mikunos: no I cannot
13:36  saje: If you use DOM see XPath.
13:36  mikunos: yes I know
13:36  saje: Yes... but somehow you have an array tree :P
13:36  mikunos: but the xml comes from a web service converted into an Array
13:37 * saje facepalms
13:37  mikunos: saje what about the criteria
13:37  mikunos: ?
13:38  mikunos: what have I send to the function?
13:38  saje: So every time you need something basic, you open the entire XML, parse it, recurseively scan it into an array, and then recursively scan it again to get two category_id-s out of it.
13:38  saje: This will run great. Great job, mikunos.
13:38  latemus: what is the significance of "->" in this statement "$this->name = $new_name"
13:38  saje: [Low Budjet, Business] <-- array('Low Budjet' (sic), 'Business')
13:39  saje: latemus, the significance is: it's a member of "$this"
13:39  saje: name is.
13:39  latemus: member?
13:39  saje: latemus, yes, do you know classes and objects?
13:39  latemus: as in its an element in an array called name?
13:39  saje: This answers my last question.
13:39  mikunos: saje, is this call right? Match($cats, array('Low Budjet' (sic), 'Business'));
13:40  latemus: thats what i'm reading about now- i was wondering if that symbol had a meaning, sounds like it does
13:40  saje: mikunos, are you trying to insult me :P? function MATCH ($criteria, $item)
13:40  saje: And you wrote (sic)?
13:40  courpse: lol.
13:40  saje: Ok, you guys.
13:40  mikunos: you have write sic
13:40  mikunos: ahhahhaa
13:40  saje: Have some readin' to do.
13:40  mikunos: :D
13:41  mikunos: saje Notice:  Undefined index: name in
13:42  mikunos: "if (in_array($item['name'], $criteria)) "
13:42  saje: mikunos, yea, it's hard to debug a structure I don't see. I geared it towards the array you pasted.
13:42  saje: mikunos *understand it*
13:42  saje: and fix it for your purposes
13:42  saje: recursion is simple
13:43  saje: courpse, what is the % of PHP devs on that level, how do you think.
13:43  mikunos: I have fix it with if (isset($item['name']) && in_array($item['name'], $criteria))
13:43  abhinav_singh: i still did not understand why php is treated as low level language level by java or .net developers..
13:43  ajavid: because it is.
13:43  mikunos: but now I don't get any result
13:43  saje: mikunos, is it possible a category can have no name?
13:44  saje: mikunos, or are you just cargo cult coding?
13:44  courpse: saje: Dont bring me into it, :P
13:44  ajavid: 'low level' or 'high level' no.
13:44  ajavid: php is crap.
13:44  mikunos: this is the structure: http://pastie.org/1215147
13:44  ajavid: that's what you meant?
13:44 * saje takes courpse by the hand.
13:44  courpse: :/
13:44  ajavid: lol
13:45  dr0id: :-/
13:45  saje: :/
13:45  saje: ajavid, what is your gripe?
13:45  abhinav_singh: Java or .net developers treats php as low level language...i mean the language which is used by developers who are not intelligent
13:45  dr0id: rue
13:45  dr0id: true*
13:45  saje: abhinav_singh, you misunderstand the term "low level"
13:45  dr0id: haha, :D
13:45  saje: abhinav_singh, and since you do PHP, I guess you kinda self-confirm your statement
13:45  dr0id: abhinav_singh: just say, "Crappy" languag
13:45  abhinav_singh: i know what is low level languages saje
13:45  ajavid: I don't have a gripe
13:46  dr0id: saje: haha
13:46  ajavid: I'm trying to figure out what abhinav_singh meant
13:46  ajavid: do you have a gripe?
13:46  saje: ajavid, yes. I have work but I am sitting here, trying to help people.
13:46  saje: Why?
13:46  ajavid: Sounds like a personal problem to me
13:46  ajavid: :)
13:46  dr0id: abhinav_singh: yeah, php and mysql are craps
13:46  saje: Yes, it is.
13:46  courpse: Disagree.
13:46  saje: I need more Dr. Phpil.
13:47  courpse: I like MySQL, :/
13:47  ajavid: haha
13:47  ajavid: dr. PHPil
13:47  dr0id: but still the *best* solutions lol :D
13:47  ajavid: :)
13:47  abhinav_singh: dr0id: then phy are you in php room...:-D
13:47  dr0id: would'nt say best, but really good solutions heh
13:47  dr0id: to entertain people like you
13:48  ajavid: all languages suck
13:48  courpse: Dont worry, i had a real good question earlier this week.
13:48  dr0id: true
13:48  courpse: couldnt belive my eyes when he asked it...
13:48  ajavid: you had a question
13:48  ajavid: and HE asked it?
13:48  saje: courpse, what was it.
13:48  dr0id: me ?
13:48  ajavid: how does that work?
13:48  courpse: "How do i count from 1 to X"
13:48  saje: courpse :(
13:48  dr0id: me ? :-O
13:48  saje: courpse, dude I thought it's *really* *good*
13:48  ajavid: Dont worry, i had a real good question earlier this week. couldnt belive my eyes when he asked it... <- does that make sense to anyone?
13:48  saje: Why are you lying to us.
13:49  dr0id: ajavid: know about d. pujas ? :P
13:49  courpse: Well, i meant good as in, really newb.
13:49  ajavid: no
13:49  ajavid: I think I misread
13:49  courpse: ajavid: meaning i was asked the question.
13:49  ajavid: you HAD a question meaning you were ASKED a question
13:49  ajavid: yes
13:49  ajavid: I got ya
13:49  ajavid: dude hang on man its that time of the morning
13:50  courpse: Still having trouble with it?
13:51  ajavid: woman problems.
13:51  saje: courpse, this morning we discussed a little why PHP frameworks are bad, I think you were around.
13:52  courpse: yeah, i stay out of those, i dont use frameworks.
13:52  courpse: At all.
13:52  ajavid: close minded twits
13:52  doonie: heh
13:52  saje: courpse, I've been thinking, maybe there are 1000-2000 frameworks that are good, but we'll never hear from them as there are too many PHP frameworks. Isn't that sad.
13:52  courpse: I dont think my php skill level is high enough to be using em.,
13:52  ajavid: you need a 'frame''work'.
13:52  courpse: I mean, i'd rather learn all the code myself than depending on frameworks.
13:52  ajavid: otherwise you have speghatti code.
13:52  ajavid: are you guys even serious?
13:53  courpse: I like speghatti.
13:53  ajavid: or just trying to troll ##php?
13:53  dr0id: I felt like zend was speghatti :P
13:53  saje: ajavid, have you heard of Martin Fowler, open minded twit :P?
13:53  ajavid: let me guess
13:53  dr0id: USE WHAT WORKS FOR YOU
13:53  dr0id: life is too short to stress on softwares :P
13:53  ajavid: you just discovered his books and now yo'ure preaching what you've learned?
13:53  ajavid: *sigh*
13:53  courpse: lol
13:53  ajavid: yo'ull grow up one day.
13:53  saje: dr0id, nah, life is toos hort not to stress out on everything you have time to stress over.
13:54  courpse: ##PHP is a very helpful channel tonight isnt it?
13:54  PiousMinion: Is there anything wrong with storing data as a serialized multi-dimentinal array in a file... or should I learn SQLite?
13:54  courpse: Very lively.
13:54  ajavid: life is too short to develop in php!
13:54  ajavid: piousminion, no need, just use a simple little orm that can use sqlite
13:54  dr0id: life is too short to learn sqlite
13:54  saje: ajavid, nah, it's an old thing.
13:54  ajavid: piousminion, store php objects into your db
13:54  dr0id: :D rofl
13:54  saje: ajavid, he basically found all PHP frameworks are crap back in 2003
13:54  ajavid: piousminion, make it easy.
13:54  silv3r_m00n: inside a class , inside a method can I change another method , e.g. inside a() can I write this >> $this->b = $this->c where b and c are both methods ?
13:54  saje: ajavid, even those which were not out in 2003
13:55  ajavid: ok
13:55  ajavid: move the php framework discussion along to ##php-offtopic
13:55  ajavid: thank you.
13:55  silv3r_m00n: dr0id: khaali bakhaan bancho
13:55  saje: silv3r_m00n, you can't
13:55  ajavid: then channel awaits you.
13:55  silv3r_m00n: saje: hmm
13:55  saje: silv3r_m00n, you can attach/remove methods, this is not JS
13:55  PiousMinion: ajavid: I'm not following.
13:55  saje: can NOT, that is
13:56  ajavid: piousminion, know anything about datamapping or relational patterns?
13:56  silv3r_m00n: saje: oh yes , I was doing js for past few days
13:56  saje: silv3r_m00n, well you can *sorta* do it with __call, and for members, see __get and __set
13:56  PiousMinion: ajavid: if I do, then not by those terms. probably not though
13:56  saje: silv3r_m00n, it allows you to handle non-existing methods and create virtual methods at runtime
13:56  silv3r_m00n: I am already using them widely
13:56  ajavid: piousminion, http://redbeanphp.com/
13:56  ajavid: piousminion, I LOVE it.
13:56  ajavid: piousminion, saved me countless hours prototyping my dbs.
13:57  ajavid: braindead easy to use.
13:57  saje: Right on the first line, Martin Fowler would reject your framework, ajavid.
13:57  ajavid: and there is also ezpdo
13:57  saje: "ORM layer!"
13:57  PiousMinion: Is this some framework thing?
13:57  ajavid: no
13:57  ajavid: ezpdo is also light weight
13:57  dr0id: silv3r_m00n: :P
13:57  ajavid: you can always write one yourself with PDO
13:58  saje: PiousMinion, this is what people who don't know SQL and are scared of it, use.
13:58  ajavid: but there are already written ones working with sqlite and they are excellent
13:58  ajavid: no need to reinvent the wheel
13:58  ajavid: Remember, time is money, so waste as little of it as possible.
13:59  saje: ajavid, I don't use ORM and I don't waste hours prorotyping my dbs. Maybe your premise is wrong.
13:59  ajavid: maybe you're just looking for argumentation and I'm about to ignore you
13:59  ajavid: go bother someone else.
13:59  PiousMinion: DBs are too easy to use someone else bloated framework.
14:00  saje: ajavid, maybe I'm trying to open the mind of someone who just called us "close minded twit"
14:00  ajavid: saje, stepped on a nerve have I?
14:00  saje: ajavid, nope.
14:00  ajavid: saje, let it go...
14:00  saje: you're welcome :)
14:00  saje: use lots of redbeans in your next project
14:01  courpse: Seems like everyone is trolling everyone, lol.
14:01  ajavid: you really think your opinion of it matters to me? you're really serious aren't you?
14:01  dr0id: no, use mr.beands :P
14:01  doonie: courpse welcome to the internets :D
14:01  dr0id: welcome doonie :)
14:01  ajavid: doonie, I love your freakin nickname
14:02  ajavid: doonie doonie doonie say it like 3 times fast
14:02  saje: ajavid, your arrogance is not an asset when you speak to me
14:02  ajavid: wicked.
14:02  ajavid: saje, you're not obligated to respond or address me kind sir.
14:02  meatbun: how can i assign a key to an array without a value?
14:02  ajavid: saje, I'm a horrible person, so please /ignore me.
14:02  doonie: :}
14:02  ajavid: thank you very much.
14:02  saje: ajavid, I don't feel obligated :)
14:02 * doonie x3
14:02  saje: I just want to
14:02  meatbun: whenever you assign a something to an array, the default take value first, if you dont put a key in there
14:02  ajavid: meatbun, $array['key'] = "";
14:02  saje: Got a problem with that?
14:03  doonie: my guess, people
14:03  meatbun: ajavid, that's not the same as null though...
14:04  saje: meatbun, it's most practical to assign "true" as the value so it works in isset() calls (avoids the need for array_key_exists, which is slower)
14:05  ajavid: meatbun, http://codepad.viper-7.com/shqKZa
14:05  ajavid: I'm sorry what?
14:05  saje: meatbun, if you *do* want to assign null, then use array_key_exists to detect presence of that key
14:06  meatbun: saje, ok. thx
14:06  meatbun: ajavid, thx
14:08 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:11  bartzy__: If I have a defined variable in a class, when I check for it , is it null ? or undefined ? how can I check it
14:11  bartzy__: isset will return true ?
14:11  saje: bartzy, isset will not return true.
14:12  bartzy__: OK so only if I actually set a value isset will return true ?
14:12  saje: bartzy, typically you should avoid members at runtime, if you need to do that maybe you can simply have an associative array to put all that in
14:14  Northwoods: which is good open source e-commerce shopping cart
14:14  saje: bartzy, check property_exists()
14:14  saje: bartzy, and for more advanced info, check the Reflection* classes
14:14  saje: bartzy, for methods it's method_exists()
14:15  meatbun: data members in a class is initialize before the constructor or after?
14:15  saje: Keep in mind before PHP 5.3, visibility affects the results of these two functions
14:15  saje: meatbun, before
14:16  NiLon: Northwoods, !+recommend
14:16  php-bot: Northwoods, No, we cannot recommend <whatever you asked about>. We're here to help you write PHP, not spend hours arguing the relative merits of A versus B. We won't recommend packages, libraries, scripts, sites, languages, version control systems, or sports teams; our only recommendation is that you please don't ask for recommendations.
14:18  meatbun: saje, ok. just like java then

14:29  saje: the flood bots are cut-throat.
14:31  [KS]: what's Suhosin Patch?
14:31  ae86-drifter: extra security
14:31  saje: [KS], security patch for PHP which does a bunch of smart things next to a bunch of stupid things to PHP.
14:31  [KS]: so it's good?
14:31  saje: Written by Stefan Esser, worldwide known douche, and zealot, although also knowledgable guy.
14:32  saje: [KS], it's a mixed bag.
14:32  saje: [KS], it can make your PHP misbehave.
14:32  saje: In some circumstances.
14:32  [KS]: so if it's behaving how I expect it, that's ok then?
14:32  saje: To determine that, if you get weird results, try without the patch, and see if i persists.
14:32  saje: Yes.
14:33  [KS]: cool
14:33  [KS]: thanks
14:33  aftab: hello i want to send url with base64_encode to a php page but sometimes base64_encode has == in it is there any other alternative to base64_encode which doesn't add characters which are not url friendly
14:34  aftab: please ?
14:34  saje: aftab, url_encode(base64($whatevs))
14:34  saje: urlencode, that is
14:34  aftab: great thanks
14:35  aftab: urlencode doesn't hide the url
14:36  aftab: viewpage=<?=base64_encode("http://www.blah.com")?>
14:36  aftab: it generates like viewpage=ada8u8u8u88==
14:36  saje: "hide it"?
14:36  aftab: i need something which doesn't add == in the generated url
14:36  aftab: hide as in encode it
14:36  aftab: but urlencode still shows the original link
14:36  saje: base64 is a crappy way to hide something
14:37  aftab: thats why i need an alternative please
14:37  saje: aftab, the example I gave was to call both
14:37  saje: not *eitheR*
14:37  salathe: the extra == is padding, just remove them :P
14:37  saje: salathe, won't help, it has also +
14:37  saje: and /
14:37  saje: it's best to urlencode
14:37  salathe: saje: i know, but that's not what he's asking for
14:38  salathe: (presumably because he doesn't know)
14:38  saje: salathe, if you remove the == some decoders won't work..
14:38  salathe: saje: and?
14:38  saje: ok, never mind everything then
14:38  saje: everything.
14:38  saje: :/
14:39  salathe: aftab: see the user comments on the manual page for base64_encode for "URI-safe" versions
14:39  aftab: thank you
14:39 --- thadin_ is now known as thadin
14:39  salathe: saje's urlencode would be the easy solution.. why can't/won't you just use that?
14:41 --- cescalante is now known as ce_afk
14:41  aftab: i will try it as well just need to run some tests to see which one looks better and doesn't send too much % or other urlencoded text
14:41  aftab: thank you again both of you
14:49  Deele: I am inside foreach loop, for an associative array, how do I normally get the key name, I am currently in?
14:50  ule: Deele: with the var you set in foreach
14:50  ae86-drifter: $var[i]?
14:50  ae86-drifter: i is the count
14:52  Deele: for example $array = array('alpha'=>array(1=>2,2=>50),'beta'=>array(1=>2,2=>50)); foreach ($array as $item) { echo 'Current key name is:'.?; }
14:52  ule: foreach (array_expression as $key => $value)
14:52  ule: You just use $value
14:54  Deele: ?
14:55  Deele: foreach ($array as $item => $key) { echo 'Current key name is:'.$key; }
14:55  bl4ckcomb_: no
14:55  bl4ckcomb_: $key => $value
14:56  Deele: ok, working, thanks!
14:57  ule: Deele: You must have to read PHP-docs. php.net/foreach
14:57  ule: :)
14:57  Deele: you guys are better than any manual :D
14:58  bl4ckcomb_: that's why we want to spend or time with stuff you can't read in the manual
14:58  bl4ckcomb_: *our

15:03  Fratyr: Hey guys. If I have .css file gzipped, what headers I need to send in order to extract it + read as css?
15:03  Fratyr: header("Content-Encoding: gzip"); and header('Content-Type: text/css'); ?
15:04  Leddy: I could use some help with sorting a multidimensional array: http://pastebin.com/mDF9yBKH
15:06  Deele: Leddy, I am currently working on same thing, multidimensional array sorting, cause sort() removes key names, but I need them
15:06  Deele: Leddy, you tried array_multisort() ?
15:07  Leddy: I can't remember if I've taken the dependency out in having the key named
15:07  Leddy: I needed it before
15:08  Leddy: hrm looks like I use it do so some filtering
15:08  bartzy__: if I do $stmt->fetchAll() on a INSERT statement... what happens ? :|
15:08  Leddy: deele: let me take another looking at that function
15:12  freepenguin0: hi
15:12  freepenguin0: how can I stop the execution of php page on apache2 without stopping the server?
15:12  dr0id: bye
15:14  dr0id: freepenguin0: exit(); die(); ?
15:15  AdvoWork: freepenguin0, don't know if you can, i've always just restarted apache for the 1 second it takes(if you mean for a script thats broke and has already been run)
15:15  bartzy__: if I do $stmt->fetchAll() on a INSERT statement... what happens ? :|
15:15  Leddy: hrm, I think I'm failing to understand how the multisort works as it doesn't seem to sort anything :(
15:16  Deele: Leddy, I got it working with uasort()
15:17  devil2005: freepenguin0: set_time_limit() on your script or exit; if you want to end it right away
15:17  AdvoWork: devil2005, what if its already ran?
15:18  devil2005: restartt apache and edit your script to use set time limit or edit your php.ini and change the max_execution time
15:19  davidthedrake: bartzy__: your question is hard to answer without more context. There is no mysqli statement::fetch_all
15:20  davidthedrake: Or PDOStatement::fetch_all for that matter.
15:23  Kingsy: if I had a string like this "1-19" how would I capture everything after the - not including the - itself? so the result would be $result = 19;
15:23  Kingsy: **?
15:23  huckfinnaafb: look for built in php string functions
15:23  ymas: Kingsy: http://php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php
15:23  zok: Have any of you used Zend Guard before?
15:24  courpse: Kingsy: explode and end
15:24  courpse: end(explode('-','1-19')); will return 19
15:24  ymas: Kingsy: get the position of the '-' using strpos
15:24  Kingsy: thanks
15:26  bartzy__: davidthedrake: I'm using PDO.
15:27  bartzy__: davidthedrake: And would like to know if it's bad to do fetchAll() on a INSERT query.
15:27  zok: What are you trying to fetch?
15:28  dr0id: nerves
15:28  zok: INSERT doesn't SELECT anything for you to fetch...
15:28  bartzy__: I'm not, but I'm using a query() function , which executes both SELECT and UPDATE and INSERT...
15:28  davidthedrake: zok: that's not necessarily true
15:28  Fratyr: Anybody? How do you uncompress gzipped css file?
15:29  davidthedrake: zok: while it doesn't select anything for you, you can get values from a fetchAll on a PDO statement insert.
15:29  bartzy__: zok: I know. So if $stmt->fetchAll (PDO) won't do anything for INSERT and it's not considered bad practice.. I'll just keep that like that.. because I don't know how to diffirntiate between SELECT and INSERT or UPDATE...
15:29  Leddy: deele: looks like array_msort in the comments did the trick
15:29  davidthedrake: zok: bartzy__: take for instance, example 3 on http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetchall.php
15:29  bartzy__: Also - Is it OK to put each class in its own class ? I understand that there's the overhead of looking up more files in the file system.... but if that's a performance problem, I can just use an opcode cache like APC right ?
15:30  davidthedrake: Not sure if the insert has anything to do with the results, since I don't have an instance to test, but it appears it may be using the inserted values to populate the array.
15:30  bartzy__: sorry : I meant put each class in its own FILE!
15:31  bartzy__: davidthedrake: OK , thanks.
15:31  zok: davidthedrake: that example doesn't use fetchAll on the insert
15:31  zok: It uses it on the select performed AFTER the insert
15:31  zok: Fratyr: tar -xzf cssfile.tar.gz
15:31  davidthedrake: zok: *nod* I see that. I guess the INSERT isn't necessary for that. NM, read that wrong. My bad.
15:32  zok: The only thing "returned" from an insert would be the auto_inc ID that the row was inserted into
15:32  zok: But you get that by doing $dbh->lastInsertId();
15:34  bartzy__: How can I make the difference between INSERT PDOStatement and SELECT PDOStatement ? Without regex or something
15:34  bartzy__: anyway ?
15:34  _nicolaas: Hi guys, I'm looking to create a secure download section with authentication. Any suggestions?
15:34  bartzy__: So I know not to fetchAll on INSERT statements ?
15:35 --- _nicolaas is now known as nicolaas
15:37  zok: bartzy__: there's no reason you should need to
15:37  nicolaas: Is there a php file manager that anyone can recommend?
15:39  devil2005: nicolaas: freshmeat.net and sourceforge.net have plenty.
15:39  nicolaas: cool thanx, will check
15:39  Kingsy: courpse - is there also a start() function ?
15:40  courpse: Kingsy: reset() is start.
15:40  Kingsy: ok np thanks
15:40  Kingsy: so that would give me "1" right?
15:40  courpse: Yes.
15:40  Kingsy: from 1-19 using explode
15:40  Kingsy: thanks

15:53  zok: Does anyone have a copy of zend guard? I'm wondering exactly what it does to protect source code from being ripped off/edited
15:54  zok: Does it just obfuscate the code?
15:54 @cythrawll: zok, in a way.
15:55  zok: cythrawll: you don't happen to have a sample output, do you?
15:55 --- ryzer is now known as ryzer-afk
15:55 @cythrawll: it actually encrypts the code, but since you have access to teh deencryption end point, it's easy to get around
15:56 @cythrawll: zok, no
15:56  zok: Aaahh
15:56 @cythrawll: because having such a thing is kinda dumb
15:56 @cythrawll: s/kinda//
15:56  zok: So it really just protects you from morons?
15:56  zok: lol
15:56  bartzy__: Also - Is it OK to put each class in its own file ? I understand that there's the overhead of looking up more files in the file system.... but if that's a performance problem, I can just use an opcode cache like APC right ?
15:56  Northwoods: #web is better than ##php , they don't cry about RECOMMENDATIONS
15:56  zok: bartzy__: I usually put similar classes in the same file
15:57  zok: bartzy__: and ONLY include the files that you need
15:57  bartzy__: zok: OK, and how do you name that multiple-class file  ?
15:57  bartzy__: If I only have 1 class per file, I name it MyClass.class.php
15:57  zok: Depends on what the classes are :p
15:57 @cythrawll: bartzy__, don't do that
15:57 @cythrawll: use APC
15:58  bartzy__: cythrawll: What's APC has to do with it ?
15:58 @cythrawll: use separate files and separate the layout according to your namespace
15:58 @cythrawll: bartzy__, it decreases the overhead of loading multiple files
15:58  bartzy__: So you say seperate each class to its own file, and let APC take care of the performance impact ?
15:58 @cythrawll: since it caches the compilation result
15:58 @cythrawll: yeah
15:58  bartzy__: cythrawll: It almost deminishing the impact isn't it ?
15:59  bartzy__: cythrawll: Thanks. That's what I started doing now but wanted to ask to be sure....
15:59 @cythrawll: eliminates.
15:59  dr0id: just trying to understand how can I implement layouts along with views :P
15:59 @cythrawll: look how zf does it?
15:59  bartzy__: cythrawll: Yeah. English is not my mother tongue...
16:01  rosstitute: whats the correct way to declare a constructor method within a class? function className() or function _construct() ?
16:02  thadin: __construct()
16:02  salathe: rosstitute: see http://php.net/oop5.decon
16:02  thadin: easier when you extend
16:03  vpv4oo: browser language check in index.php, then header('Location: http://example.com/'.$lang.'/'); . header() wont allow relative paths. what should i use instead of header here?
16:03  rosstitute: __construct it is then
16:03  rosstitute: thanks
16:06  el_kevino: vpv4oo: have you tried header("Location: http://example.com/$lang/") ?
16:07  vpv4oo: el_kevino: i would prefer to use a relative path, is that possible somehow?

16:17  Loonatic: Anyones can tell me if desactivating magic quotes is a good or bad idea ??
16:17  DeviaVir: Hi all, I'm running into problems with my shared hosting server. When people upload or use fwrite the file is saved with apache or nginx as the user. How can I be able to change this to the user that is actually "hosting"?
16:18  davidthedrake: Loonatic: relying on magic quotes is a bad idea. It's been deprecated in PHP 5.3
16:19  Loonatic: davidthedrake: so deactivating it would not create security issue since there would be any escapae caracter ?
16:20 --- haygus_ is now known as haygus
16:21  davidthedrake: Loonatic: it depends on the condition of your current codebase I s'pose. If disabling magic quotes makes it insecure, you will need to fix things.
16:21  Loonatic: davidthedrake: Then i would need to check the code in all my shared hosting site....
16:21  Loonatic: damn...
16:22  davidthedrake: Relying on magic quotes for security is a bad idea anyway.
16:23  Loonatic: davidthedrake: no i'm not  relying on it for security but i wonder if that's gonna create more issue then anything.... 1user need that 150other i dont know...

16:24  davidthedrake: If there's code that relies on magic quotes to be enabled, then yes, there's a chance disabling will cause issues.
16:26  Loonatic: davidthedrake: i'm not good in php but can you tell me if i do a search in all php file for magicquotes  i should find  some using the variables ?

16:27  rosstitute: if the scope of a class function isnt provided, is it assumed public?
16:27  davidthedrake: Loonatic: well, magicquotes isn't a funciton so... it would be difficult to recommend a particular search that would allow you to find instances that may break. It's up to you how you handle disabling them and communicating with your users.

16:28  fruitwerks: I'm getting ignored in #mysql so I am asking here.. ok yesterday I was told it is not possible to offset feedfreq with a supplied value "SELECT DATE_ADD(lfeddate,INTERVAL feedfreq DAY) < NOW() AS eating" - can I do it with a subquery? I need to somehow subtract a value from feedfreq
16:28  sacho: rosstitute: yes
16:28  rosstitute: bles: show your code
16:28  rosstitute: sacho: thanks
16:28  sacho: fruitwerks: getting "ignored" in that channel doesn't make your question any more on-topic here.
16:29  sacho: fruitwerks: most people interested in a mysql discussion would simply join both channels
16:29  fruitwerks: sacho I know, but I see plenty of sql in here as well, hoping someone will have a bit of insight
16:30  bles: rosstitute: it's a script, it was working good till yesterday, then had some problems with the server, user permissions changed somehow, then i got this error

16:34  Kyle__: Can anyone reccomend a good, simple blog/cms system in php that uses flat files/xml/sqlite or something simple for storage?  I've read the wikipedia comparison of CMS software, but wanted some first-hand accounts to point me in the right direction.
16:35  lewellyn: Kyle__: i've used frog + sqlite with not many complaints other than the normal "stupid plugin authors forgetting not everyone uses mysql!" stuff
16:35  DeviaVir: Can someone help me out with php scripts that upload files becoming owned by apache:apache?
16:35  lewellyn: which really is silly considering how easy it is to set up a sqlite database. :P
16:35  NoiseEee: Kyle__: why would you be seeking that instead of a proper database
16:35  Kyle__: DeviaVir: php is being run as apache, files created by it will be owned by apache.
16:36  lewellyn: NoiseEee: for most purposes, it's at least as proper as say mysql.
16:36  NoiseEee: lewellyn: fair enough, i was referring to his request for flat-files or xml
16:36  lewellyn: if you have 20 megabytes of mostly-read data, why waste the cpu/ram of a database?
16:37  dr0id: where do I learn apc ?
16:37  lewellyn: NoiseEee: and flat files have nothing wrong with them
16:37  Kyle__: NoiseEee: two reasons.  One, for under a certain number of pages a transactional db is less efficient than flat files.  Two (more importantly) the box is supposed to be for simple domain based hosting, and I've already told others I'm not running a DB on it.
16:37  NoiseEee: lewellyn: for a CMS, i would never choose flat files personally
16:37  davidthedrake: dr0id: http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php
16:37  DeviaVir: Kyle__: I noticed, any way I can change that?
16:37  NoiseEee: but you can all debate the point, im not interested
16:37  Kyle__: Sqlite can run nicely inside of php, so I'll make that exception easily.
16:37  lewellyn: NoiseEee: funny. i've purposely chosen them many times.
16:37  littlebearz: NoiseEee: that really depend on how big
16:37  dr0id: am there only davidthedrake , but there's function lists etc. umm, let me spend some more time
16:38  lewellyn: Kyle__: sqlite is just a glorified flat file ;)
16:38  Kyle__: DeviaVir: Root has the right to change ownership.  This is the nature of the beast :) but I'm sure someone can point you in the direction you need.
16:38  davidthedrake: dr0id: what are you trying to learn?
16:38  dr0id: how to implement APC in my app
16:38  littlebearz: NoiseEee: I use it ALOT for flat filed ie http://gallery.littlebearz.com uses a xml
16:38  Kyle__: lewellyn: I know :) but it's a nice glorified flat file, for when dbm won't quite cut it.
16:38  NoiseEee: nice littlebearz
16:38  d3c: validating a URL with ÆØÅ (UTF-8) chars via filter_var's FILTER_VALIDATE_URL fails. the URL is valid, though. for instance, http://www.æøå.dk - what can I do?
16:38  Kyle__: NoiseEee: There are some interesting articles if you can dig them up, about why/where flat files are more efficient.  Good reading if you can find it :)
16:39  littlebearz: d3c: LOLZ, that's a valid link?
16:39  d3c: littlebearz: yes
16:39  thadin: d3c, the .nl tld doesn't allow special utf-8 chars, so it's hard to check
16:40  Kyle__: And of course I meant relational, not transactional back there... Dohh.  Need more coffee.
16:40  d3c: thadin: why would you need to check it on the .nl tld?
16:40  lewellyn: Kyle__: yeah. and there's lots of practical obvious reasons. but he said he's not interested. *shrug*
16:40  littlebearz: .nl is neterland?
16:40 * Kyle__ nods
16:41  Kyle__: lewellyn: I'm a particular fan of dokuwiki, but eh, it's not quite right for a blog :)
16:41  NoiseEee: lewellyn: truthfully databases are part of the requirements where i work, im sure if i was designing something from scratch that wasn't DB heavy i'd look at flat files
16:41  NoiseEee: either case, smugness--
16:41  littlebearz: Kyle__: I use a mediawiki http://wiki.littlebearz.com
16:41  thadin: d3c: I mean it is hard to implement a function to validate all urls.. each TLD has different rules wich makes it "valid"
16:42  Kyle__: littlebearz: mediawiki is way to heavy for what I want :)
16:42  lewellyn: NoiseEee: i wasn't being smug. i was responding to your questioning why he'd want to use proper-sized stuff.
16:42  littlebearz: Kyle__: you need a blog  or a wiki?
16:42 * Kyle__ actually has a mediawiki box running a full local wikipedia mirror... I wonder what it's up to nowdays...
16:42  littlebearz: I use dot clear for wiki
16:42  bl4ckcomb_: d3c, what do you mean by valid url? one that can exits or one that exists?
16:42  littlebearz: I meant mediawiki for wiki and dot-clear for blogging platform
16:42  d3c: bl4ckcomb_: one that can exist
16:42  Kyle__: littlebearz: Blog.  Hence why I'm not using dokuwiki, which is my favorite for small wikis.
16:43  Kyle__: hum.
16:43  littlebearz: d3c: that depends on whether your top domain supports UTF-8
16:43  bl4ckcomb_: d3c, ok, that's hard
16:43  Kyle__: littlebearz: Thereare are TLDs that don't support utf-8?
16:43  d3c: bl4ckcomb_: but shouldn't PHP's FILTER_VALIDATE_URL allow URLs such as æøå.dk?
16:43  littlebearz: Kyle__: I think .ca doesn't
16:43  NoiseEee: d3c: it should, yes
16:43  Kyle__: wow
16:44  NoiseEee: d3c: but at the moment it doesn't, the whole utf-8 in URL's is rather new
16:44  Kyle__: d3c: it should, because there are non-tlds that are valid URLs.
16:44  Kyle__: local, private, etc.
16:44  d3c: NoiseEee: yes, it's only a few years since it became available ;-) heh. well, any dirty hack to fix it or something?

16:45  NoiseEee: d3c: depending on how badly you need it to be 100% accurate, you can use mbstring regex stuff and do your best attempt

16:47  Kyle__: I know somewhere there's an article (either joel on software or coding-horror I think) where they actually demonstrate a regex that properly verifies 100% of proper urls.  It was NASTY.
16:47  d3c: NoiseEee: alright. I'll put some regex together then. thanks
16:47  Kyle__: Oh god, no.  Regex is not for that....
16:47  lewellyn: Kyle__: aha. it's punycode.
16:47  NoiseEee: no, its not, but at the moment there is no other alternative to try to validate a URL like that

16:55  bles: the code was working
16:55  NoiseEee: bles:  sounds like you screwed up the permissions.  files still need to be readable by the webserver

16:56  Kyle__: lewellyn: Well, they did for the EU, but they're following suit in most other markets as well.  It's the micro-usb connector.
16:56  NoiseEee: bles: why are you messing with permissions in the first place?
16:56  mahen23: anyone intersted?
16:56  el_kevino: mahen23: what is your site?
16:56  DeviaVir: mahen23: What's it about?
16:56  lewellyn: Kyle__: my phone has mini

16:57  el_kevino: if it isn't a blender, it's all wrong
16:57  Kyle__: lewellyn: My old phone did too, but my new one is the micro.  Dunno what they do about the iphone though.  Knowing apple they probably got some legal-loophole.
16:57  bles: NoiseEee: I did not, it's a long story. http://pastebin.com/q546P6eA - this is the ls -la output.
16:57  mahen23: pm me
16:57  lewellyn: it also has additional connectors inside, giving it iirc 12 pins, so i can use the add-on cables for like vga out and such

21:18  kaylee_work: I know how to see what items are SELECTED in a multi-select form element when it's submitted...... is there anyway to find out what items are in the select but not "selected"?
21:18 @TML: lenswipe: Yes, if PHP can read it, PHP can read it - that doesn't make it "privileged"

21:19  urbee: #httpd folks say this is a php error
21:19  urbee: what tha hell is it? :)
21:19  Polleke: urbee, an apache error
21:19 @TML: urbee: Can't say I've ever seen that one before
21:19 @cyth: kaylee_work, yeah only way to know that is if you have a set of elements that you rendered in the select box, and diff it from what you got back from the form.
21:19  xconspirisist: urbee: Never seen that before either.

21:20  kaspar: Hey guys. I've got a Best-Practise question: Say I've got same kind of library, and many classes should be able to log messages to some logging facility (currently \Zend\Log), how would you implement this? Currently every logging-enabled class has setLogger/getLogger methods, and injects the logger to each class it uses, if the used class is not injected itself. Is this the right way to go? Becauso almost every class now provides the s

21:21  xconspirisist: urbee: Does php -f work on the CLI?
21:21  urbee: TML, cyth: i have an user complaining he cannot upload more then 5 photos on his site, he gets a "timeout"
21:21  slashxr: haha, well thats what YOU think
21:21 @cyth: slashxr, most people who hang out here are the wrong market for a CMS :p
21:21  urbee: xconspirisist: it works
21:21 @TML: urbee: 70007 appears to be "timeout"
21:21  bl4ckcomb_: kaspar, observer pattern
21:21  Polleke: urbee, it seems related to proxies. Could that be the case?
21:21  xconspirisist: Ah, just stops ever now-and-then. That's really quite odd.
21:22  slashxr: i have yet to meet a single php programmer who did not use joomla
21:22 @TML: slashxr: You've now met at least 10 of them
21:22  urbee: Polleke: no proxies here

21:23  bl4ckcomb_: kaspar, then that's the best practice imo
21:23 @TML: urbee: So in some instances, your PHP handler takes too long to return results, so Apache gives up
21:24  toxictux: urbee, i would check the runtime of the page in apache log
21:24  toxictux: urbee, if it worked some time or does it fail everytime?
21:25  Denicked: would this work?
21:25  Denicked: http://www.pastebin.org/157270
21:25  kaspar: It just bugs me, that I have to imlement getLogger/setLogger in all classes. It just doesnt feel right. But  a god-object (providing those methods) isn't an option as well. Probably this would be right place for traits...
21:26 @TML: No
21:26  Denicked: essentially I'm openning an executable in a text processor, copying and pasting the text to another file, and then naming it zip.exe
21:26  Denicked: I always wondered if you could do that.
21:26  Denicked: TML yeah it wasn't working for me. Just thought that maybe it would and maybe I was just doing it wrong
21:27  xconspirisist: erm, that sorta should work.
21:27  bl4ckcomb_: Denicked, why don't you use curl or wget?
21:27  urbee: toxictux: it fails every time
21:27 @TML: I was trying to be facetious. Obviously, it failed.
21:27  devil2005: Denicked: you would need to use fopen + foef() in a while loop i would imagine... thats what i woudl do
21:28 @TML: urbee: Profile your PHP script to see why it's taking so long, or up the timeout limit
21:28  xconspirisist: Denicked:  file_put_contents("hax.exe", file_get_contents("http://example.com/hax.exe"));
21:28  urbee: TML: the php file uploads photos thats why its taking so long
21:29  urbee: TML: but the max_execution_time or whatever is set to 180sec and it fails sonner than that
21:29  xconspirisist: Denicked: php.net/allow_url_fopen
21:29 @TML: urbee: There's a timeout on the httpd side that needs to be set higher
21:31  xconspirisist: urbee: I think it's simply "Timeout" in httpd.conf.
21:31  urbee: okay
21:31  urbee: i'll try that
21:31 @TML: urbee: The httpd is giving up when PHP is still running, which is what the 70007 means
21:31  lenswipe: TML, never the less, its somewhere a normal user couldnt get to
21:31 @TML: lenswipe: Hunh?
21:31  lenswipe: TML, say i put the mysql password in /var/www PHP can read it, but a normal user cant
21:32  lenswipe: TML, say a user creates a PHP file that runs file_get_contents on mysql.php
21:32 @TML: lenswipe: So normal users can't connect to the database?
21:32  lenswipe: TML, why do they need to?
21:32  xconspirisist: urbee: Try "Timeout 200" in your httpd config, if you then get a PHP timeout instead of a 70007, you know it's just httpd.
21:32 @TML: I have no idea, it's your setup, not mine
21:32  urbee: TML: "Timeout 300" is set in httpd.conf
21:32  lenswipe: TML, in a normal situation, you have the php and mysql stuff in /var/www
21:32 @TML: lenswipe: On my machines, normal users can read anything under /var/www, so...
21:33  lenswipe: TML, apache can read that, normal user cant
21:33  toxictux: urbee, did you restart apache after setting it?
21:33 @TML: Well, /srv/www, but the point remains
21:33  urbee: toxictux: it was set by default that way
21:33  lenswipe: TML, so you store your mysql password where a normal user can read it?
21:33  lenswipe: TML, thats crazy
21:33 @TML: lenswipe: Sure, since normal users are allowed to use the database
21:33  lenswipe: TML, the point is this:
21:33  lenswipe: that machine has a web app running on it with admins and users in the web app
21:33 @TML: If you have an account on my machine, you have rights to use any software installed on the machine
21:34  lenswipe: TML, if allow all users to read the mysql password it sort of negates the whole point of diffferent user groups on the weba pp
21:34  lenswipe: TML, its none of my business, but allowing normal users to read your mysql password seems like a crazy thing to do
21:35 @TML: lenswipe: Normal users on *my* machines have full sudo access, so giving them the mysql password isn't a problem
21:35  lenswipe: ah right...
21:35  lenswipe: again not a good idea
21:35 @TML: *shrug* It's a *great* idea for me. It means I don't have to hold their hands.
21:35  xconspirisist: lenswipe: You realize web app groups and unix groups are separate right?
21:35 @TML: They can do whatever needs to be done
21:35  lenswipe: TML, you will when they break shit
21:35  lenswipe: xconspirisist, yes
21:35  xconspirisist: mkay.
21:35 @TML: lenswipe: I've been running this way for 15 years and never had a problem.
21:35  lenswipe: mmkay
21:36  toxictux: lenswipe, depends on your users
21:36  devil2005: TML: i ahvent been reaing the full conversation ... but what is a shell is uplaoded to your site. they ccan connect to the DB and F**k S**t up ?
21:36  lenswipe: toxictux, well seeing as i just caught one of them trying to DDOS another site, lets just say they are exactly white hat
21:36  toxictux: lenswipe, some users might repear sh*t
21:36  xconspirisist: lenswipe: I have a maine with several mates who can full sudo, I trust the people who get shell accounts on my box.

21:36  NoiseEee: lenswipe: how are users able to access files in other vhost directories?
21:37  lenswipe: NoiseEee, only the sudo users
21:37 @TML: devil2005: Why would they bother doing that when they already have full sudo access?
21:37  gp5st: any reason to use uniqid(NULL, TRUE) vs uniqid(mt_rand(), TRUE) vs uniqid(time(), TRUE) vs md5(mt_rand().time()) vs uuid_gen()
21:37  lenswipe: the way it works is this
21:37  lenswipe: we have normal users and admins
21:37  NoiseEee: lenswipe: right. well nobody should have sudo access in a shared environment, yes?
21:37  lenswipe: NoiseEee, admins do
21:37  lenswipe: nobody else
21:37 @TML: NoiseEee: Or everyone should, with the understanding that everyone else does as well :)
21:37  lenswipe: the normal users can store stuff and runs irc bots from their shell and home dir
21:38  NoiseEee: admins of various vhosts, lenswipe?
21:38  lenswipe: apart from that they cant do much
21:38  lenswipe: NoiseEee, no
21:38  lenswipe: just listen
21:38  lenswipe: they have public_html under their home dir
21:38  lenswipe: and a web app runs from /var/www
21:38  urbee: TML, toxictux: the user tells me he times out after a minute or so, but apache doesnt timeot that fast
21:38  lenswipe: in the web app some of them are admins and some arent
21:38 @TML: lenswipe: So use one of the 4 or 5 solutions we've already told you about, instead of arguing with us
21:38  lenswipe: if i allow them to see the mysql password that kind of negates the idea of privaliges in the web app
21:38  lenswipe: screw this
21:38  gp5st: i know there is a bunch of discussion about it on the uniqid page, but it all seems very soft

21:41  kra5001: ignore_user_abort(true);
21:41 @TML: urbee: I didn't say it was Timeout - that was someone else. All I said is that there's SOMETHING in your httpd configuration that tells it to hang up on the PHP handler before it's done processing.
