09:27  GoogleGuy: hi over here
09:27  iaj: what's the most common way to iterate line by line over a file, and do something with each line?
09:27  iaj: I tried that SplFileObject - but it doesn't seem to work out on my windows machine
09:28  Northwoods: i need little help , i'm generating gift certificates ( promo codes to be redeemed by customers while shopping ) , say i have generate a code XYZ-2010-112 , and i assign it to all ( 3k ) customers , what i'm doing is storing the gift certificate ( auto-id ) against customer-id in a second table , does that mean if i have say 50 promo codes , and i assign it to all customers , that would mean...
09:28  Northwoods: ...50 x 3000 , i.e. 1,50000 entries in second table ?
09:29  Northwoods: and would be heavy to go through all to find , available code for particular cust
09:33  saje: ss23 "It wasn't as bad as it could've been" <-- in the world of PHP that's not a compliment, because it could've been beyond horrible.
09:33  saje: WordPress is just horrible-ish.
09:34  GoogleGuy: Let's all hate on WordPress because we have nothing better to do, meh
09:34 * saje hates
09:34 * GoogleGuy is hatred free
09:34  GoogleGuy: I can't believe it's not hatred!
09:34  G_G: I hate wordpress
09:34  G_G: urg!
09:35  G_G: and google
09:35  G_G: and facebook
09:35  G_G: *puke*
09:35  G_G: they are destroying the interweb
09:35  saje: What a coincidence, Google made WordPress, and Facebook recently bought Google.
09:35  GoogleGuy: I'm sure you're very valuable to society though
09:35  GoogleGuy: saje: But doesn't Yahoo make the stuff that Facebook is made of?
09:36  saje: GoogleGuy, hmmm
09:36  GoogleGuy: what do they call that... fecal matter?

09:37  Superman_: how to redirect to a url that is restricted before login and website ask to logged in before going to that page
09:37  saje: Superman_, O_o
09:37  saje: Superman_, the site doing the login should handle that typically
09:37  GoogleGuy: Northwoods: I'm just gonna say this because it's bothering me and not because I think you're in any way a bad guy..... but WTF are you doing man?
09:37  ajavid: well I just did what none in here were able to understand, despite my explaining myself a billion times.
09:37  saje: Superman_, by remembering where the user came from
09:37  G_G: Superman_: put a <post> with the url & a input field for username & password
09:38  ajavid: life is a blast.
09:38  saje: G_G, that assumes he knows the password
09:38  saje: Or asks the user.. anyway
09:38  saje: ajavid, blast you :/
09:39  GoogleGuy: ajavid: you made home brewed Starbucks coffee!!!
09:39  Superman_: like if we want to comment on a youtube video it will ask you to login before posting and take you to the login page and then after login send you back to the page from where you redirected to login page
09:40  Superman_: any thoughts how can i do that
09:40  Superman_: ?
09:40  GoogleGuy: OK ajavid if you want to PM me that you fu**** my mom you might as well be a man about it and say in the channel
09:40  saje: Superman_, 1) you serve the login right there on the url without redirecting
09:40  ajavid: I'm sorry?
09:40  ajavid: come again?
09:40  saje: Superman_, 2) when you redirect to the login you store the last attempted URL in $_SESSION or pass it to the login via $_GET as in:  /?returnto=....
09:41  GoogleGuy: ah, that's what I thought
09:41  saje: GoogleGuy, I think he just suggested that you go f* yourself
09:41  GoogleGuy: saje: horrible job at that
09:42  saje: Nah, he did, I see it in his eyes.
09:42  GoogleGuy: are they all googley?

09:49 @LawnGnome: I've had enough of all of you. Cool off for a bit.
09:54 +Viper-7: "never argue with an idiot, they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience"
09:55  Superman_: how we can delete the orphaned records from adjacency list?
09:55  Sausage: How can  if ($rscore >= 6) { file_put_contents('tt', $rscore); }  possibly be giving "1", regardless of whether it's a float or int?
09:56  Sausage: It's nothing to do with writing the file, though. Appending it to a string is the same.
09:56  Sausage: I am sure rscore is not a reference/object/anything stupid
09:56 +Viper-7: var_dump($rscore);
09:56 +Viper-7: if its a string, maybe theres whitespace or html tags or some nonsense at the start of it ?
09:57  Sausage: It comes from a function that definitely returns a float
09:57 +Viper-7: well somethings wrong, and its pretty hard for it to be file_put_contents at fault, so you need to do some more basic debugging to narrow it down
09:57  Sausage: The >= 6 comparison seems to work correctly as well
09:57 +Viper-7: like.. var_dump'ing the value instead of writing it
09:58  Sausage: I am doing that now, but I'm working with no console obviously :P *looks up the ob_ junk*
09:58 +Viper-7: or even try like file_put_contents('foo.txt', serialize($rscore))
09:59  Sausage: Umm... print_r gave no output...
10:00  Sausage: Actually, it destroyed my string.
10:00 +Viper-7: err
10:00 +Viper-7: doubtful
10:00  Sausage: Oh nope, it worked... it's becoming a boolean somewhere apparently.
10:01  Sausage: Which makes even less sense
10:01  Sausage: For one (bool)$x >= 6 would never be true
10:02  Sausage: Unless that's one of PHP's quirks... *checks*
10:02 +Viper-7: not that i know of
10:02 +Viper-7: in that state, $x should be cast to an integer for the comparison, but shrug
10:03  Sausage: [18:31:48]	<Sausage>	`eval return true >= 6;      	<A>	1
10:03  Sausage: NEVER MIND.
10:03  Sausage: How true got there is simple enough: My function is cached *reloads*
10:03 +Viper-7: ahh, of course
10:03 +Viper-7: 6 is cast to a boolean heh
10:04 +Viper-7: so its $x >= true
10:04  Sausage: That is... mildy confusing.
10:04 +Viper-7: yeah, not intuitive at all, but hey
10:05  PascalHunger: as much as php is hated on, its so hard for me to use anything else and I try
10:05  Sausage: Try Ruby. It's not regarded at the level of a decomposing rat covered in shit in a trash can, and it's dynamic.
10:06 +Viper-7: Sausage: pray you never have to touch coldfusion then
10:06 +Viper-7: php is an absolute _DREAM_ by comparison heh
10:06 +Viper-7: and ruby is very very cool, but no more useful / better in production imo
10:06  Sausage: I've touched C++. PHP is definitely a dream.
10:06 * Viper-7 stops before starting a holy way
10:06 +Viper-7: *war
10:09 * Locobob dreams of the PHP days before being forced onto java
10:09  Locobob: :P
10:11  dr0id: Viper-7: so php is the most useful and best in production ? :P
10:11  johnb003: how can I sort an array of objects by the return value of a member function?
10:11 +Viper-7: dr0id: you should know well my standard response to that :P
10:11  sacho: johnb003: usort, generally
10:11  Phaded: probably not the most useful but most used
10:11 +Viper-7: the system that best matches your requirements is the best and most useful to YOU in production :P
10:12  johnb003: k thanks sacho
10:13  dr0id: Viper-7: btw, any solution to that no image found -> calling controller -> session_start() -> webpage loading slow ?
10:13 +Viper-7: from a purely technical standpoint, i'd take python over php, java, ruby, etc any day of the week. but every language has its pros & cons, both in the core API itself, and the available modules/packages/frameworks/cms engines. for a happy medium between all of that, i choose PHP
10:14  dr0id: yeah, with php you can earn money too :P
10:14  dr0id: and feed urself
10:14  Phaded: you can earn money with anything, php has earned me over 100k so im not complaining lol
10:15  dr0id: lol, 100k in how many days ?
10:15  Phaded: last 2 years
10:15 +Viper-7: dr0id: dont call session_start() on requests when your controller detects it to be a non existant url ? or if you dont know that early.. call session_write_close() once you do know that this is an error request, or best yet, stop requesting files that dont exist on your server. no matter what you do the request will still be passed to php, which for many static files, quickly adds up to a huge extra server load, which you can only fix by repairing your content a
10:16 +Viper-7: i have mates that make _good_ money coding python
10:16  Phaded: that might dramastically increase this year since i've picked up more clients and some neat projects
10:17  dr0id: nice to hear, local clients or global ?
10:17  Phaded: its getting boring though, not really learning anything new sucks
10:17  dr0id: by global I mean via internet
10:17  Phaded: both
10:17  Phaded: s
10:17 +Viper-7: and why not, python can be up to *10 times* faster than PHP in some synthetic benchmarks (tho realistically, that averages out closer to 2 times, which is then negated entirely by extremely poor application code)
10:17  dr0id: how do you get clients on net ?
10:18  Phaded: last time i looked for a job was a few months ago, either its the same clients or they send me new clients.
10:18  dr0id: Viper-7: hmm...i think you are right, there's only 1 way, fixing the content
10:18  dr0id: "dont call session_start() on requests when your controller detects it to be a non existant url ?" <-- not possible
10:19 +Viper-7: aye, i figured as much
10:19 +Viper-7: session_write_close() would ease things (it will remove the session lock for that request) but its still a dirty fix
10:19  dr0id: yes, it's firty
10:19  dr0id: dirty*
10:20  dr0id: hey, Codeigniter doesn't calls session_start() at all, weird
10:20  PascalHunger: I have no clue on what php framework i should start messing with :(
10:20 +Viper-7: dr0id: codeigniter doesnt use php sessions
10:20  dr0id: insane :P
10:20 +Viper-7: it uses its own custom cookie system (which is poorly and insecurely implemented)
10:20  Phaded: fuckin hate code igniter
10:20  Phaded: yeah
10:20  Phaded: and horrible
10:20 +Viper-7: all data you put in a CI session is readable by clients
10:20  dr0id: Viper-7: well, say in SS, whenever a page is loaded, is session_start() called?
10:21  dr0id: even if it's not needed ?
10:21  Phaded: not in all cases viper, you can encrypt them, or use mysql
10:21  PascalHunger: Phaded: what do you suggest?
10:21 +Viper-7: dr0id: depends if its needed or not - thats managed by the Session class - if anything reads/writes to the session, and its not active, its started at that point
10:21 +Viper-7: ie, on demand
10:21 +Viper-7: Phaded: or just ignore CI's junk and use php sessions :D
10:21  dr0id: ic
10:21  edgars: hey
10:22  dr0id: it's very difficutl to use php sessions in CI
10:22  dr0id: :P
10:22  dr0id: that's what my partner said me just now heh
10:22  Phaded: i honestly just go generic, i have a pretty decent like.. starting point that just has: pages, smarty, mysql, all set up. plus clean urls as well
10:22 +Viper-7: its not that hard :P
10:22  Phaded: i doubt that.
10:22  PascalHunger: Phaded: cake?
10:23  Phaded: no, its not any framework
10:23  edgars: i have problems with attaching files larger than 2MB via squirrel mail, after some seconds of processing i got white page and mail is not sent :( upload limit is set to 20MB
10:23  Phaded: i guess its my own framework if anything?
10:23  edgars: what else i need to check and dig?
10:23  dr0id: Viper-7: so SS has a Session class, which you need to mess with in order to use php sessions, right? and whenever you instantiate that class,session_Start() is called, something like that ?
10:23  PascalHunger: Phaded: what do you think of cake?
10:23  Phaded: i've never used it.
10:24  dr0id: PascalHunger: write your own framework quickly :)
10:24 +Viper-7: dr0id: kinda.. its more like a registry, you just use Session::get('key') and Session::set('key', 'value') in your code, the framework manages the rest for you automatically
10:24 +Viper-7: dr0id: merry christmas - http://codepad.viper-7.com/LLbhHI - a custom shopping written as a codeigniter library, using PHP sessions
10:24  dr0id: can I check whether session_start has been called or not?
10:24 +Viper-7: dr0id: call session_id()
10:24 +Viper-7: if it returns false, then theres no active php session
10:24  Phaded: i've always found this happening: either you gotta start hacking shit to get it to work your way, you have to dig around to see how they intended things to be, and idk...
10:24  dr0id: aah, I think I can do it "on demand" too :)
10:24  Phaded: it just seems nasty.
10:25  dr0id: SUPERB :)
10:25 +Viper-7: *shopping cart
10:25  dr0id: Viper-7: I have written my own good cart class :)
10:25  Phaded: the whole idea of using a framework doesn't make shit easier. it over complicates and your coding in someone elses standards (which isn't always bad...)
10:25  dr0id: Viper-7: see PM
10:26 +Viper-7: Phaded: for a solo developer, a framework / cms represents a huge timesaving in code they dont need to rewrite. in a team, those standards you mention are essential.
10:26  Phaded: yeah i agree, standards are needed... i've never found a decent coder to team with so i stick with solo shit

10:33  ss23: 19:32:52 <php-bot> White Screen Of Death: If you're seeing a blank page (and view-source is empty), try putting: <?php error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', 1); ?> at the top of your script. Also enable error logging, See: http://php.net/log_errors & http://php.net/error_log
10:33  ss23: That's what php-bot wanted to say
10:33  ss23: rah: Start with editing your php.ini
10:33 +Viper-7: rah: then put <?php phpinfo(); ?> in a script and view it, check the Loaded Configuration File, and in that php.ini, set error_reporting to -1, and display_errors to On
10:33  ss23: Viper-7: Psh, that's what I said basically
10:34 +Viper-7: quality not quantity mate ;)
10:34  ss23:  :< I was both of those things
10:35 +Viper-7: back on silverstripe, i guess its because i dont care about silverstripe as a cms package, i've taken the codebase and am calling it my own, it just saved me about 2 years of dev time in building a cms the way i'd like to have it
10:35 +Viper-7: (which is unfortunately, fairly rails inspired) :(
10:36  ss23: I guess NZ developers just do things right ;)
10:36  hmd: Viper-7, does that mean you don't integrate updates from the official release.
10:36 +Viper-7: hmd: i do, i have a custom merge process - that said, it seems like many of my core changes may find their way back to the silverstripe core

10:37  rah: Viper-7: I've done that, I get nothing in apache's error log

10:37  rah: Viper-7: I still get a white page
10:38  ss23: I had my analytics module change put in
10:38 +Viper-7: if you're still getting a white screen, and are CERTAIN you've edited the correct php.ini file (the one listed by phpinfo()), then it must be something in your code either changing your error reporting level, or setting a custom error handler

10:40 +Viper-7: god i'd like so much to rip all the prototype code out, but who has the time
10:41  ss23: Last time I worked with SS is when they decided to switch to jQuery :P
10:41  rah: Viper-7: I now get a 200 error code, but the page is still blank
10:42  Fratyr: Hello guys. I have .gz file (compressed javascript) using php function gzcompress($path, 9); ... The question is - how do I read It on a frontend? It throws me Content-encoding error. I'm sending content-type: text/javascript and content-encoding: gzip headers, then using readfile($path) to read css file. also tried with additional headers: vary: accept-encoding and content-length: filesize($path) ----- Any ideas on how to read this fi
10:42 +Viper-7: rah: 200 is the HTTP response code for "everything was ok", are you sure your php code is actually outputting something ?
10:43 +Viper-7: ss23: i'd be happy with prototype or jquery, but this wierd blend they have atm is just nasty
10:43  rah: http://codepad.org/DkD5MJjI
10:43  rah: that's the state of play
10:43  ss23: Viper-7: Maybe in the next GSOC Silvestripe can snap up some motivated youngins to complete the switch :P
10:44 +Viper-7: heh
10:44  rah: Viper-7: yes, there was a full working forum there before I changed the apache packages
10:45 +Viper-7: rah: well php is working if info.php is giving you output. checked the default document? (does /ita_forum/index.php or such work maybe?) otherwise it has to be something in your code, an exit() or die() or such
10:45  bastic: rawr that was gay
10:46  rah: Viper-7: if there was an exit or die, there would be an error message
10:46 +Viper-7: rah: nope
10:46 +Viper-7: they dont raise an error, they just end execution, and will result in the 200 response code blank page you're seeing
10:46 +Viper-7: (as will an empty php file)
10:47 +Viper-7: Fratyr: i think you're overcomplicating things ;) both your webserver and php probably already have the ability to gzip content on the fly, without making any changes to your code
10:48 +Viper-7: its best handled by your webserver, so ask #httpd or such, but you can do the same in php with the ob gz handler
10:48 +Viper-7: you shouldnt try to compress the content yourself heh
10:48  bastic: have you tried adding: ob_end_flush() at the top of the file? (idk if your including other things that might of turned ob on?) but i've seen it happen
10:49 --- merlin83_ is now known as merlin83
10:49 +Viper-7: Fratyr: you're only allowed to use gzip encoding if the client tells you they support it first - the logic for detecting this can be cumbersome, but as i mentioned, both your webserver and php likely already have support for this built in ;)
10:49 +Viper-7: -goneski
10:52  Fratyr: Viper-7: True. But I can't do It on the fly. Some technical restrictions and "that's how we want It to be" from Boss. So I need to read gzipped file. Which means we create It on backend, and upon project deployment new version of gz javascript is sent to frontend as well.
10:53  rah: how do I output text in php?
10:53  ss23: Fratyr: Good luck with that :)
10:53  ss23: rah: echo "test";
10:54  bastic: Fratyr: http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/ that site shows both ways to do it, with webserver and php
10:55  Fratyr: bastic: I think this is what I need: http://www.sonassi.com/knowledge-base/combine-and-compile-css-and-js-into-gzipped-files/
10:55  bastic: ohhh

10:58  hmd: Are these combining CSS and JS into *one* file?
10:59  portalpie: Ok, so I am trying to do this thumbnail creation thing with max width and height. The idea being that once the thumb has been created to longest side the other will resize proportionally but I am having mixed results.
11:01  portalpie: Have been trying a couple of math methods but neither are working: http://codepad.org/nxnsRmqU
11:01  hmd: portalpie, if you have $newWidth, then $newHeight = $oldHeight*$newWidth/$oldWidth
11:03  portalpie: hmd: and for $newHeight you would just basically do the same?
11:03  portalpie: hmd: but swapping the names around
11:05  hmd: Exactly.
11:08  silv3r_m00n: is this syntax correct ?
11:08  silv3r_m00n: $debug == 1 ? flush() : '';
11:09  ss23: It works I believe
11:09  hmd: silv3r_m00n, it is, but is that longer:  if ($debug == 1) flush();
11:10  portalpie: hmd: So just do both of these... $newwidth = $currwidth*$newheight/$oldheight
11:10  portalpie:                 $newheight = $currheight*$newwidth/$oldwidth
11:11  hmd: portalpie, you can try $newWidth as $maxWidth and see if $newHeight > $maxHeight, if it is, you swap around and start with $newHeight set to $maxHeight
11:11  hmd: portalpie, otherwise you keep the first results.
11:11  hmd: portalpie, this is the entire algorithm

11:12  mamooth: Is someone know about a serious abstract data type library?
11:12  hmd: mamooth, describe your requirements.
11:12  Sausage: length/area units?
11:12  portalpie: thanks hmd: I am getting closer to getting my head around this
11:13  mamooth: hmd, I'm looking for something similar to java.lang.Collections
11:13  Sausage: The library is called $x = array();
11:14  mamooth: Sausage, just a joke
11:14  Sausage: Who's joking? =\
11:14  mamooth: array?
11:14  Sausage: The array in PHP takes the place of any data structure.
11:15  Sausage: It just does everything and does it poorly rather than specializing :P
11:15  hmd: Oh, I wouldn't say poorly.
11:16  hmd: Performance-wise and RAM-wise it's poorly, sure, so are objects. But feature/API wise, arrays are the best thing in PHP.
11:16  mamooth: Sausage, I'm just looking for something closer to java collections
11:16  Sausage: The "collection" type you want is dependant on how you use the array
11:16  hmd: mamooth, array() is what we use.
11:17  hmd: mamooth, if you can't do something specific, ask us a specific question.
11:17  mamooth: hmd, yeah, me too
11:17  Sausage: There's no clean way to implement a set, I guess. :P
11:18  Sausage: $x[$value] = true; but that only works with built-in types
11:18  mamooth: hmd, well, my specific question is that: Is there any library attempting to implement a standard abstract data type set of interfaces, such as those used in several others OO languages?
11:18  hmd: Sausage, what do you want out of your set, which is not clean.
11:18  Sausage: What?
11:19  hmd: mamooth, PHP 5.3 adds some data structures as classes, it's part of the SPL. These are fixed array, stack, queue, heap and so on.
11:19  Sausage: mamooth: SPL has some things that the built-in array can't do
11:19  Salathe: mamooth: the SPL would be the closest in PHP itself, but it's not even close to Java
11:19  hmd: mamooth, apart from this, it's all array()
11:19  Sausage: ... snap
11:19  mamooth: ok
11:19  mamooth: thanks
11:19  mamooth: :)
11:19  hmd: mamooth, look in the manual for all array functions and realize all things you can do with it
11:19  Salathe: aww, Sausage you win
11:20  mamooth: hmd, I'm quite well used to php and arrays
11:20  mamooth: but I would appreciate to use something more OO
11:20  rah: what does the '@' symbol signify in '@mysql_connect(...)' ?
11:21  Sausage: It's the STFU operator.
11:21  rah: (a function call)
11:21  Salathe: rah: php.net/@
11:21  hmd: mamooth, whether you type $array->shuffle() or array_shuffle($array) seems like a minor detail to me.
11:21  Sausage: It's a unary operator that sets the error reporting level to 0 until the expression following it ends.
11:21  hmd: mamooth, if you want OOP, check ArrayObject.
11:21  Sausage: Some messy crap PHP needs since it throws up errors (warnings) in non-fatal cases.
11:22  portalpie: hmd: I spoke too soon. So confused. Might sleep on it.
11:22  mamooth: hmd, weel, I love functional programming, and most php built-in array related functions are designed in this way. But what I would like to have is decent maps, hash, sets, queues, etc ...
11:22  Sausage: PHP's array definitely resembles a map the most :P
11:23  Sausage: Except the part where it keeps everything in order
11:23  mamooth: I'm not satisfied by the SPL classes and API
11:23  Sausage: queues/stacks are simply done with array_push/pop
11:23  mamooth: Sausage, of course, arrays are powerfull, but there're lack of constraints :)
11:23  Salathe: mamooth: well that's all you're getting, so you'll just have to be unsatisfied :P
11:23  mamooth: :)
11:23  Sausage: You may also have noticed you can compare a boolean to a string.
11:23  hmd: portalpie, maxWidth: mw, maxHeight: mh, oldHeight: oh, oldWidth: ow, newHeight: nh, newWidth: nw.   nw = mw; nh = nw * oh / ow; if (nh > mh) { nh = mh; nw = nh * ow / oh }
11:23  Sausage: Welcome to PHP.
11:24  mamooth: Thanks
11:25  portalpie: hmd: For a second there I thought that you were having a joke with me to confuse me more :) I will give it another go. Really should have listened to my maths teacher in school.
11:26  hmd: mamooth, if you have specific problem, ask..
11:26  mamooth: hmd, no, I haven't
11:27  Sausage: Having a single data structure type has some benefits...
11:27  mamooth: yeah
11:27  mamooth: I guess I'm just not in the php spirit
11:28  Sausage: Though PHP is duck typed, so if you give your "containers" standard interfaces like the STL you can get the same benefits with checking.
11:28  mamooth: I'm coming from a strong OO background, and duck typing don't made my life easy
11:28  hmd: mamooth, it helps to think of arrays as tuples (and named tuples) in functional languages.
11:28  Sausage: The problem is just how PHP is designed :(
11:28  mamooth: that's it
11:29  mamooth: in fact, I'm not sure if the problem come from the language or from the programmer
11:29  mamooth: but anyway, I'm feel much more comfortable with a language like scala
11:29  mamooth: but I HAVE to deal with php :)
11:29  mamooth: a job is a job ;p
11:30  Sausage: PHP can be fun. Very fun.
11:30 --- Farkie[Away] is now known as Farkie
11:30  Sausage: Plus it almost forces you to get work done instead of screwing around with design.
11:30  Sausage: That's my #1 problem with programming anything: I dont' spend enough time programming.
11:30  mamooth: yes, but it can also be very frustrating
11:31  hmd: mamooth, I feel like you should be able to tell us what exactly is frustrating
11:31  mamooth: but once again, it may be the programmer fault, not the language
11:32  mamooth: hmd, for example, I always deal with weak collections of objects. Principally with symfony
11:32  mamooth: by weak, I mean not constrained
11:32  mamooth: constrained by type
11:32  hmd: mamooth, I'm also coming from strong OOP background, and so if you can't pinpoint a specific issue, I'd say let some time pass. Things will start snapping in place.
11:32  hmd: ok
11:32  mamooth: you're probably right
11:33  mamooth: the major parts of bugs I have in my code come from thoses weak collections
11:33  hmd: mamooth, in PHP when you design services/models you often deal with serialized data from outside which is untyped as well, be it via POST, serialize(), JSON.
11:33  Sausage: My problems come from self-made complexity
11:33  hmd: So handling and validating untyped maps/lists is pretty much an architectural necessity
11:33  Sausage: Like my ORM system malfunctioning.
11:33  mamooth: but I'm certainly not familiar enough with duck typing
11:34  mamooth: hmd, you're right
11:34  Sausage: Heh. You will find yourself abusing duck typing if you've used C++
11:34  hmd: mamooth, PHP doesn't use ducktyping, it uses dynamic typing, whereas duck typing is implicit static typing.
11:34  Sausage: I keep neglecting to write implicit interfaces.
11:35  mamooth: hmd, I'm not sure to understand the distinction you made between php typing system and ducktyping
11:35  Sausage: Plus the fact you can't specify "SimpleXMLElement implements my interface"
11:35  mamooth: insn't duck typing related to a programming style?
11:36  hmd: mamooth, I'm not familiar to such a style. Duck typing is when you don't write a type on a var, but it's inferred from context and the values you assign to it, *at compile time*.
11:36  hmd: functional languages typically use ducktyping
11:36  mamooth: in fact, when I want to work against duck typing in php, I feel I'm working against the language itself
11:36  Sausage: I thought duck typing was just generic programming using dynamic typing.
11:36  hmd: JS, PHP use dynamic typing: the type is stored in the object itself and is fully mutable
11:36  mamooth: hmd, well, I'm learning Haskell. I don't feel haskell is duck typed :)
11:36 +Viper-7: In duck typing, one is concerned with just those aspects of an object that are used, rather than with the type of the object itself. For example, in a non-duck-typed language, one can create a function that takes an object of type Duck and calls that object's walk and quack methods. In a duck-typed language, the equivalent function would take an object of any type and call that object's walk and quack methods.
11:36 +Viper-7: If the object does not have the methods that are called then the function signals a run-time error. It is this action of any object having the correct walk and quack methods being accepted by the function that evokes the quotation and hence the name of this form of typing.
11:37  Sausage: I wonder how concepts in PHP would go :P
11:37  Sausage: interfaces seem to go "against the grain" too :P
11:37 +Viper-7: php walks between worlds heh
11:37 +Viper-7: both interfaces and class type hinting work against that
11:38  mamooth: Viper-7, that's the way I understand duck typing
11:38  mamooth: Viper-7, yeah, it's the good word "against"
11:38  mamooth: that where I don't feel comfortable
11:38  sacho: so what is the point of duck typing?
11:39  sacho: it seems more like an omission rule
11:39  Sausage: Concepts specify the way you make an object quack, with the ability to "type hint" with third-party objects.
11:39  Sausage: Of course, because PHP is so great, you can do that yourself with a simple function call at the top of each function
11:39 +Viper-7: mamooth: that said - i dont believe that to be a flaw in php - duck typing has its merits in being highly dynamic, but a clear inheritance chain and strong interfaces also arent bad things
11:39  Sausage: And concept maps can be done with plain forwarding classes
11:40 +Viper-7: mamooth: i think the key is that in php you can use duck typing wherever you like, not that you "must code that way"
11:40 --- RJD22|away is now known as RJD22
11:40  Sausage: I'm losing more and more faith in "pure" oop.
11:40 +Viper-7: its not a standard to go one way or the other
11:40 +Viper-7: i like php's semi-oop heh
11:40 +Viper-7: even without interfaces
11:40  mamooth: In my experience (well, in my code), most of bugs comes from weak collections. As long as I haven't a strong collection library, I feel that working with type hinting and collections will always be working against php spirit
11:40 +Viper-7: (but with traits :D)
11:40 +Viper-7: mamooth: you can still build strong collections in php
11:40  mamooth: I'm thinking about that
11:41  mamooth: *with type hinting and interfaces
11:42  hmd: Some do that, it represents overhead.
11:42 +Viper-7: my ORM does just such a thing, collections are "DataObjectSet"s, all records are "DataObject"s or derivitives, you wont get strong type restrictions down to a specific source table, but its clean & obvious that a DataObjectSet will only hold DataObjects - and its easy to enforce that, either through interfaces, type hinting, or inheritance stack checking
11:42  hmd: Especially if you consider that you often need a "slice" of an object, not the entire set of fields.
11:42  hmd: How do you validate that, when its validity is context-dependant?
11:42  Sausage: Well.. /my/ ORM blanks random fields in objects. :D
11:42 +Viper-7: lol
11:43  mamooth: ok anyway, thanks for the discussion guys! :) I have to get back to work :)
11:43  dr0id: mamooth: please don't get back to work
11:43  mamooth: haha :)
11:43  hmd: If you let fields be defined or not defined, then we're back to the same problem: bugs because a column you expect is not there.
11:44 +Viper-7: im wondering what the name is for what hmd was talking about - static typing vs dynamic typing vs implicit typing
11:44  hmd: Even strong OOP languages like C# have this dilemma between slicing and pure objects.
11:44 +Viper-7: as in, the implicit typing that ruby and such does
11:44 +Viper-7: hmd: traits solve all :D
11:45  hmd: Viper-7, type inference, I had the impression when someone says "duck typing" he means that by default.
11:45 +Viper-7: they're just near impossible to get playing nicely with each other heh
11:45 +Viper-7: "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck."
11:45  hmd: Almost all duck typed languages I've used resolve everything to static types at compile time.
11:45 +Viper-7: lmao, thats the justification behind the name
11:45 +Viper-7: hmd: fair enough
11:46  Ilie: hi guys, I just did a php online test, I'm interested if I can see the questions again, if they were cached, I used google chrome, any sugestinons ?
11:46  Superman_: I have a little problem in inserting a record in database
11:47  Superman_: I need to insert a product in products table and its images in gallery table
11:47  Superman_: but confuse how i make the link between them
11:47  hmd: Superman_, images will have productId column
11:47  Superman_: I maintained the adjacency list list also in schema
