10:31  iaj: lo there
10:31  joshsmith: I'd like {$query} to be a named or unnamed placeholder, but it simply won't work
10:31  iaj: when I got a variable containing 2 strings like $a = "foo bar"; how could I extract the first and the second string to two different variables?
10:31  joshsmith: I'm not sure if it's the single quotes that's doing it or what; any help would be deeply appreciated
10:31  Snoopal: does somebody of you know a supportchannel for phplist ?
10:31  bngle: thadin: are discussing what again?
10:31  Mark_Morcom: Hi - http://pastey.net/141871 - The UPDATE is not working - I have no clue why
10:32  joshsmith: Mark_Morcom: That's probably a question for #mysql
10:32  bngle: thadin: checking if string is '' -> $var === ''; isset($var[0]); strlen($var) === 0; ....
10:32  Snoopal: Mark_Morcom -> echo mysql_error();
10:32  Mark_Morcom: Well its mysql in PHP
10:32  Keloran: iaj: you can explode on space
10:32  Snoopal: and you will know what the problem is
10:32  Mark_Morcom: I know the SQL is correct it works in PMA
10:33  Keloran: joshsmith: thats really a question for sphinx
10:33  joshsmith: Keloran: well it's a PDO question
10:33  joshsmith: not a Sphinx question
10:33  Keloran: why did you mention sphinx then ?
10:33  joshsmith: the problem is clearly with the placeholders, not with anything with SphinxSE
10:34  joshsmith: because it's contextual information that simply doesn't make sense to omit
10:34  Snoopal: Mark_Morcom just use that and you will know why mysql does not your update ;)
10:34  joshsmith: would you prefer I abstract all my questions away so that they're in the most generalized form possible?
10:34  Shwaiil: Hi people
10:36  Keloran: joshsmith: so your query looks like, "SELECT this FROM here WHERE :jimmy = 1" ?
10:36  Keloran: or even, WHERE ? = 1
10:36  iaj: Keloran: so I'd do  $refs = explode(" ",$a);   and then $refs[0] or $refs[1] would contain of the strings?
10:37  Keloran: iaj: yeah
10:37  iaj: thanks a lot
10:37  joshsmith: no it looks like "SELECT this FROM here WHERE query='?*;mode=any';"
10:38  Keloran: and that isnt being bound with the bindParam ?
10:38  joshsmith: does PDO automatically insert single quotes?
10:39  Keloran: depends on the string yeah
10:39  Keloran: so if the value is a number, then it doesnt, if its a string then yes
10:39  joshsmith: no I use execute(array($query))
10:40  Keloran: so your query would look like WHERE query=''asda'*;...
10:40  joshsmith: ah, is there any way to parametrize but not place it in single quotes
10:40  Keloran: or if its a number, then it would do, WHERE query='3*;...
10:40  joshsmith: gotcha; I forgot that was the case
10:41 --- Evanlec_ is now known as Evanlec
10:43  joshsmith: does bindParam() also do the same? with PDO::PARAM_STR?
10:43  Keloran: yes
10:43  joshsmith: gah
10:43  Keloran: if you want that string, you want to pass the whole thing
10:43  joshsmith: does PDO have a function for pure escaping, then?
10:43  Keloran: so ? == (stuff) . "*;mode=any'
10:44  Keloran: (well with the correct " ')
10:49  smallfoot-: how do i make IF where first condition must be true, then one of the two following conditions must be true too?
10:50  spuun: if (cond1 && (cond2 || cond3))
10:50  smallfoot-: like IF ($a == 1 && ($b == 2 || $c == 3)
10:50  smallfoot-: oh, that works?
10:51  spuun: yes.
10:51  iaj: Keloran: another question.. lets say I want to split a string at the last space... so the first string $a should contain everything up to that last space, and the string $b only the last 'word' how would I achieve that?
10:51  _nix00: hi,all. I found if  switch control structure is included in foreach structure , if I use continue in switch, it is invaild. so it is php problem, not my mistake , am I right ?
10:51  joshsmith: Keloran: thanks; what I think I'm going to do is just do $query = $query . "*;mode=any"; and then $query = $this->dbh->quote($query);
10:51  smallfoot-: cool
10:52  joshsmith: spuun: that doesn't work in all cases
10:52  joshsmith: nevermind
10:52  joshsmith: misread
10:52  spuun: B]
10:52  joshsmith: logic != working at 2AM
10:54  _nix00: ok, I get it lol. Note: Note that unlike some other languages, the applewebdata://99234FA5-B21B-4F45-BDE7-66735C570ADE/control-structures.continue.html statement applies to switch and acts similar to break. If you have a switch inside a loop and wish to continue to the next iteration of the outer loop, usecontinue 2.
10:54  styol: joshsmith: i disagree
10:55  styol: depends on whether or not you're in the zone, and i guess not being tired as hell helps also
10:55  joshsmith: yeah, I am well out of the zone and tired as hell
10:55  joshsmith: it has rained non-stop in San Diego, which is just so far outside my comfort zone I feel like I'm gonna be sick
10:55  styol: sleep has been deprecated
10:56  joshsmith: I'm still running on Sleephp 4
10:56  styol: ah yeah im in LA.. waiting for the rain, only seen a lil
10:56  silv3r_m00n: where does this method come from >> java_require ?
10:56  styol: its probably headed here
10:56  joshsmith: I didn't sign up for this
10:56  styol: you signed the waiver, i have it
10:56  styol: and im gonna blow it up at kinkos
10:57  joshsmith: gah, you're a bureaucratic nightmare, styol
10:58  styol: not until i take out the advertisement
10:58  joshsmith: oh, thank God! I finally have SphinxSE working in production
10:59  joshsmith: Oh man, that only took a metric ton of my blood, sweat, and tears
11:00  styol: its gonna be so worth it though
11:02  joshsmith: so true, so very true
11:02  joshsmith: for future reference, anyone thinking of trying to compile Sphinx as a plugin should forget it
11:02  joshsmith: remove MySQL entirely and reinstall
11:02  joshsmith: it is less effort
11:02  joshsmith: I'm just putting that out there in the universe
11:03  styol: i will remember this. it will possibly prevent red hot pokers
11:03  ss23: I thought people used Solr these dayys :S
11:03  joshsmith: depends on your use case
11:03  styol: i hear usually either solr or sphinx.. or lucerne?
11:04  ss23: Lucene is the back end to solr
11:04  joshsmith: Lucene
11:04  joshsmith: they merged
11:04  styol: ah lucerne api
11:04  joshsmith: both under the same team
11:04  ss23: Apache put out some kick-ass stuff
11:05  styol: only a few animals were harmed in the making of apache
11:05  joshsmith: The thing that killed Solr for me was that it outputs in XML
11:05  joshsmith: making it a performance bust
11:06  ss23: joshsmith: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolJSON
11:06  joshsmith: I think there are some other response writers, but Sphinx was quick to do (other than the prod problems)
11:06  ss23: Yeah, definitly a case of using what you can
11:06  joshsmith: but that was really ultimately my fault
11:07  joshsmith: I'd wanted to use Solr originally, but went with Sphinx ultimately
11:07  joshsmith: partially because it was the recommended engine in High Performance MySQL
11:08  joshsmith: hmm getting JSON output would be awesome, actually
11:08  joshsmith: but whatever
11:08  joshsmith: time wasted implementing Solr now == too much
11:09  ss23: I'm just glad I'm not the one working with Solr at my work. I mean, cool stuff and all but... seems like such work to get anything done
11:09  styol: especially 5 minutes after gettting sphinx setup? at least give her a drive around the block
11:09  joshsmith: oh well I've had Sphinx working on my laptop
11:09  joshsmith: and it's awesome
11:09  joshsmith: I've got a kind of weird use case in some situations, too
11:09  styol: ah word, ive only used solr so i guess im just projecting
11:09  joshsmith: I'm actually doing recommendations with it
11:10  ss23: I think we used solr for our recomendations engine too
11:10  styol: like did you mean or what
11:10  styol: oh like this this out too or you might also be interested in or something?
11:10  ss23: I'm guessing the latter styol
11:10  styol: *check this
11:11  ss23: Only issue we have with Solr is "Did you mean?"
11:11  ss23: It's spell check/suggest thing is crap
11:11  admin0: how do I get an array key from a value ?
11:11  styol: array_keys()? from a value hmm
11:11  ss23: admin0: array_keys?
11:12  admin0: never mind .. found it :)
11:12  admin0: sorry
11:12  styol: i wonder how did you mean is going to like mostly names
11:12  styol: im guessing im going to have to note use it more often then not
11:12  styol: or does it base it on actual stuff in the index?
11:13  styol: *not
11:13  ss23: styol: Uh, what?
11:13  styol: ss23: sorry, do you know if solr's "Did you mean?" is based on an actual dictionary, or is it based off the indexed terms or whatever its called (im  not deep in it yet)
11:14  ss23: Not sure, but probably some sort of dictionary. As I said, we had problems with it. We don't even use it because of how bad it is
11:14  ss23: (Although we could just be configuring/using it really wrong I guess :S)
11:14  styol: yeah thats what i was just realizing is im using it (or tested it) but its likely not going to work in reality because most of the things that will be searched are names as opposed to common dictionary words or even common devices or anything like that
11:14  joshsmith: The one thing that makes me think an eventual switch to Solr down the road might not be a bad idea is that I'm using Sphinx to do a lot of autosuggestions
11:14  joshsmith: so getting JSON out would be awesome
11:15  styol: ss23: thats the thing too is im almost always sure that im doing something wrong with it haha
11:15  joshsmith: plus the fact that Solr seems capable of pulling out document data so I don't have to make a round trip myself
11:20  marthinal: if i use strtotime("now 00:00 +2"); i have correctly today at 00:00 dont understand why +2???? normally strtotime("now 00:00 "); is ok but i put it and then i have 10/20/2010 - 02:00
11:21  Keloran: what is your timezone set to
11:22  dr0id: anything wrong here -> $arr['content'] = str_replace("{age}, {error_age}", $form_meta_vals['age'] . "," . $valid_msg2['err1']['age']['error'][0], $arr['content']); ?
11:22  ss23: Looks okay
11:23  dr0id: replacement doesn't occurs
11:23  marthinal: Keloran dont know excuse me how i can check it?
11:23  dr0id: but when I do $arr['content'] = str_replace("{age}", $form_meta_vals['age'], $arr['content']); replacement for {age} occurs
11:23  Keloran: marthinal: echo date("e");
11:24  ss23: dr0id: Not 100%... probably just the space wrong or something
11:24  Keloran: dr0id: did you read the specs ?
11:24  dr0id: yeah I did
11:24  marthinal: ok Keloran i check it
11:24  Keloran: dr0id: if you want to replace multiple things with seperate values, then you need to read the spec it tells you how
11:24  dr0id: I did read
11:25  ss23: Keloran: What he's doing should work
11:25  dr0id: yeah, it should, as I have done the same thing with different values before too
11:25  marthinal: Keloran i have 01/01/1970 - 02:00
11:26  ss23: http://codepad.viper-7.com/Rhw7U1 dr0id - Works there
11:26  ss23: dr0id: Pastebin your $arr['content']
11:26  smallfoot-: if any way check if a variable has one or another value with IF?
11:26  smallfoot-: like IF ($var == (1 || 2)) ?
11:26  Keloran: marthinal: what version of php are you using ?
11:27  ss23: smallfoot-: if (($var == 'lol') or ($var == 'no'))
11:27  ss23: smallfoot-: No "short" way of doing it like that unfortunatly (but I wish there was)
11:27  marthinal: PHP Version 5.2.6
11:27  smallfoot-: ss23, i must check the $var twice, i cant use $var = (1 or 2) ?
11:27  Keloran: marthinal: http://codepad.viper-7.com/RhzgIJ because thats the kind of thing that should return
11:27  dr0id: ss23: 1 sec
11:27  smallfoot-: ss23, okay
11:29  dr0id: ss23: http://codepad.viper-7.com/3QpQwd and http://codepad.viper-7.com/NmoHhd
11:29  marthinal: Keloran UTC
11:30  ss23: dr0id: ... You can't replace two values like that
11:30  marthinal: i did a date_format is for that i had the other result
11:30  haygus: hi, i have a question about session_set_save_handler
11:30  ss23: dr0id: Do two str_replaces. Do one for the {age} then one for {error_age}
11:30  joshsmith: this is bizarre
11:30  dr0id: why not like that ss23?
11:30  haygus: "The garbage collector, this is executed when the session garbage collector is executed and takes the max session lifetime as its only parameter. "
11:30  ss23: dr0id: It's looking for '{age}, {error_age}'
11:30  haygus: when the session garbage collector is exectured ?
11:31  joshsmith: I moved from one Linode to another, and suddenly PHP isn't serving the index.php, but will serve other php files
11:31  joshsmith: any ideas as to why?
11:31  dr0id: ss23: why does it works in your case then ?
11:31  Keloran: joshsmith: any index, or just that one ?
11:31  joshsmith: Keloran: just that one
11:31  dr0id: ss23: I also tried "{age}, {error_age}" before (if you are talking about the space after the comma)
11:32  joshsmith: all other PHP files work just fine and dady
11:32  joshsmith: *dandy
11:32  Keloran: joshsmith: why not recreate it ?, copy content, delete file, create file, paste content
11:32  ss23: dr0id: Because my content is literally "{age}, {error_age}"
11:32  ss23: dr0id: It needs to find that exact line
11:33  dr0id: o sorry yes :P
11:33  joshsmith: Keloran: no good
11:33  ss23: joshsmith: Error reporting all turned on?
11:33  Keloran: joshsmith: does it not serve it at all, or does it just echo the raw source
11:33  ss23: And what do you mean by "isn't serving"
11:33  dr0id: ss23: hell, they have to be arrays lol, my mistake
11:34  joshsmith: it downloads the page
11:34  joshsmith: doesn't display anything, just downloads it directly
11:34  Keloran: thats why i said read the spec
11:34  ss23: I misunderstood what you were doing dr0id :S
11:34  ss23: I thought you were searching for the literal string
11:35  dr0id: sorry my mistake, wanted array there :P should had read the specs when Keloran mentioned :P
11:35  joshsmith: hmm this might be a Chrome issue and not a me issue
11:35  Keloran: joshsmith: link ?
11:35  ss23: joshsmith: Hmm, you're the second person to have an issue like this that I've seen in here today :S
11:35  joshsmith: http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=6eef714cbdc12d30&hl=en
11:36  joshsmith: There's a long discussion there about it
11:36  thadin: haygus: probability/divisor is ithe chance the gc is called in a request
11:38  admin0: hi ..this is my code:   http://php.pastebin.com/Z8WzrEhW    -- why does my loop goes on and on even after it finds the value ?
11:39  ss23: Why would it stop?
11:39  ss23: You haven't told it to stop there that I can see :S
11:39  admin0: how to tell it to stop :D
11:39  admin0: i can see that it gets the accid in the 3rd or 4th table
11:39  admin0: from the echo statement
11:40  ss23: Oh, beecause of the while you mean
11:40  ss23: admin0: You have it around the wrong way :P
11:40  ss23: admin0: I'll codepad it for you
11:40  admin0: i have 7 identical tables .. which is passed from the array ..
11:40  admin0: ok
11:41  thadin: admin0: http://php.net/break
11:41  ss23: admin0: http://codepad.viper-7.com/fpPt02
11:41  ss23: That's still bad though
11:41  ss23: But it is probably more what you wanted
11:42  ss23: admin0: Instead, at the bottom of that foreach, do "if $bla == '' { break; }"
11:42  thadin: ss23: admin0's code was better, yours will create an infinite loop
11:43  Keloran: broken or better...
11:43  haygus: thadin: session.gc_probability is 1; session.gc_divisor 100
11:43  admin0: :D
11:43  ss23: Ah, crap
11:43  ss23: Okay, I take it back :S
11:43  ss23: It's late! I blame the lateness >.> <.<
11:43  thadin: haygus: so you have a chance of 1% that the gc is called at a request
11:44  haygus: for test how can i do for 100% ?
11:45  haygus: divizor to 1 ?
11:45  thadin: yes
11:46  Keloran: http://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Dynamic-Web-Sites/dp/032152599X now thats a book ahead of its time LOL
11:46  admin0: thadin, ss23 , the break worked .. thanks .. updated code here: http://php.pastebin.com/p44nFviL
11:47  thadin: admin0: skip the while loop
11:47  thadin: otherwise you'll get an infite loop as well if the records aren't found in a table
11:48  thadin: and remeber to escape your data
11:48  admin0: escape ?
11:48  admin0: you mean mysql one ?
11:49  admin0: thadin, i have been using this for a while: http://php.pastebin.com/6VPtky6A  -- to clean all variables
11:49  thadin: yes, don't send raw input to the DB
11:49  admin0: i do have : mysql_real_escape_string
11:49  admin0: up somewhere
11:51  thadin: you're "clean" function will destroy normal data as well
11:51  thadin: just use mysql_real_escape_string once
11:51  admin0: noted
11:52  haygus: thadin, thank you
11:53  Despe70: pretty sure it's obvious, but how can I remove a value from an array ?  $a = array ('green', 'blue', 'red'), remove 'blue' (without knowing it's key) ?
11:54  admin0: Despe70, i had asked this a while ago, but found out myself ...  to get the key, use  array_search('your-value-here',$array-name);
11:55  admin0: and it will give you the key
11:58  Despe70: admin0: k, thought that there was a function just to remove a vallue
11:58  Despe70: but i'll work it out that way
12:01  nVee: hi guys
12:01  nVee: what is the best way to get docroot
12:01  nVee: i am busy with a front controller
12:01  nVee: but looking for the best way to get docroot
12:02  negev: hi, is there any way to 'stub' function calls out in php?  in the past i've done this using the php debugger's rename_function() but that no longer works with 5.3.0
12:02  negev: specifically i want to be able to catch certain function calls and reroute them elsewhere, for the purpose of unit testing.

12:56  Raydiation: hi im looking for something like django, just for php
12:57  Keloran: eh
12:57  Myztik: then you've come to the wrong place
12:57  Keloran: we dont recommend frameworks
12:57  Keloran: frameworks, ides, editors, hats are holy wars
12:57  Raydiation: Keloran: what do you recommend then? cms?
12:58  Keloran: we dont recommend any (most) 3rd party scripts
12:58  Raydiation: :/
12:59  Myztik: Raydiation: The channel is for helping people write PHP
12:59  Keloran: were here to help you write php, not help you find something that does the work for you
12:59  ultramage: hello, this is something I've been meaning to ask for a while now: what's the best practices for avoiding/dealing with race conditions in php code?
12:59  Raydiation: dunno, maybe someone used django before and knows a pretty equivalent php framework
13:00  Raydiation: i basically just look for a very close copy done in php
13:00  Myztik: Raydiation: We're not a search engine
13:01  Myztik: go to #phpc or whatever it's called
13:01  Raydiation: Myztik: hm ok cya
13:20  j0nr: hey all...need a little help.
13:20  j0nr: this script throws up just "Connect Error (0)" in my browser... but I can't figure out why... http://paste.pocoo.org/show/277921/
13:21  j0nr: I think it is happengin around line 23/24
13:23  thadin: replace  or die('Connect Error ('.mysqli_connect_errno().')'.mysqli_connect_error());    with     or die('Mysql error: '.myql_error());
13:23  thadin: code is still wrong, but better then you have atm
13:24  j0nr: thadin that just gives: Fatal error: Call to undefined function myql_error()
13:24  thadin: j0nr: oh, you're using mysqli.. so use mysqli_error($link)
13:24  j0nr: ah
13:25  j0nr: or die('Mysql error: '.myqli_error($link));   < like that?
13:25  thadin: yeah
13:28  j0nr: still undefined function error
13:28  thadin: you don't have the s in your code
13:28  thadin: (forgot it in mine as well the first time)
13:29  j0nr: heh...typo
13:40  nVee: Hi Keloran, you here?
13:41  nVee: Busy with a front controller, but remembering from a previous experience, i have an issue i would like to resolve before I do the code. With my previous controller, I had a class which "put together" the template, and the output was then used with e.g. $page->view()
13:41  nVee: this however cause big issues with not being able to use other classes as you can only extend 1 extra class (and the output was built using a class)
13:42  Xcon: heya guys, could someone please help me? http://codepad.org/ORdZgbVq <-- Once you have logged into paypal and it redirects to our page, its only fetching back the payment amount, not the contractor ID, job ID, invoice number, any ideas please?
13:42  nVee: can you give me some ideas on how to do this better? build a template and output, but still have full access to the other classes?
13:43  j0nr: wow... am learning the devastating power of a _single_ incorrectly captilised letter in my code
13:43  nVee: xcon: apart from the syntax issues
13:43  Xcon: just noticed that myself
13:43  nVee: umm what is in configuration.php?
13:44  Xcon: just the configuration of the site for access etc
13:44  nVee: wher eis $row["intid"] specified?
13:44  Xcon: nothing todo with the paypal
13:45  Xcon: defined in configuration.php
13:45  nVee: ah okay
13:45  Xcon: i just dont understand why its recognising to send the payment amount
13:45  Xcon: but none of the other fields
13:45  nVee: well wait
13:46  nVee: is the issue the form not posting?
13:46  Xcon: no
13:46  Xcon: its posting
13:46  Xcon: going through to paypal sandbox
13:46  Keloran: nVee: yeah im here
13:46  Xcon: im then logging in, its sending me back to my page, with the following
13:46  nVee: mind reading my message at the top?
13:46  Xcon: http://codepad.org/WC8h29SX
13:46  nVee: i can repaste but you know how the people get :P
13:47  Xcon: http://codepad.org/7cAfRDtt
13:47  Keloran: your wondering how to get other classes but can only extend 1 ?
13:47  Xcon: sorry thats the url
13:48  nVee: not really, its more a "how would you do it" question as appose to a query
13:48  j0nr: hmmm... ok I am fetching an array of mysql rows and then echo'ing a list of certain cell names... e.g. one column is called 'name', so I just echo a list of 'name'.... but sometimes there are rows where name is the same.... I need to some how not repeat listing entries that have already been listed.
13:48  j0nr: so I cant just  while($uploadRow = mysqli_fetch_array($uploadResult)) {
13:49  j0nr: echo ...
13:49  j0nr: as it iterates row by row
13:49  silver_star_iri: hello , how i can measure a user how long be there in my site ?
13:49  Keloran: i only have 2 classes that extend, the rest grab an instnace of the other classes or call those classes from the main, e.g. if i want to get the template class tehn $template = $hammer->getTemplate, if its one not in the main then i do $hammer->getnail("name");
13:50  Keloran: then if i need that passed down the chain, i pass it down, e.g. $hammer->getnail("asda", $hammer->getnail("template"));
13:50  nVee: i see
13:51  nVee: it appears that there will be a lot of debating surrounding this topic
13:51  Keloran: or because everything knows about hammer, i request that class as needed
13:52  nVee: Keloran, do you have time, mind if I private you? I want to just run my logic past you
13:52  Keloran: okie dokie

13:57  silver_star_iri:  how i can measure a user how long be there in my site ?
14:02  solofight: how can i change the post_max_size php.ini setting from .htaccess file ?
14:02  further: silver_star_iri: how about have a try of google analytics?
14:06  dr0id: silver_star_iri: google analytics, or JS(Ajax)
14:07  zamba: heavy stuff
14:07  thadin: solofight: php_value post_max_size 4M   or something
14:08 +Viper-7: James13433: it is case sensitive
14:08  solofight: thadin, got it thank you its php_value post_max_size
14:09  James13433: yer just realised, had to edit my database
14:10  solofight: in the value field can i give something like 1G ?
14:11  solofight: by default they have specified in M => mb
14:11  solofight: ? can i say G
14:11  solofight: ?
14:11  solofight: thadin, ^
14:11 +Viper-7: a) try it, b) check the manual, or c) use 1000M instead of 1G
14:12 +Viper-7: php.net/ini - click directives, click post_max_size
14:12 +Viper-7: it should be documented ;)
14:12 --- Putr is now known as Putr|Away
14:12  solofight: Viper-7, :) i am trying it already, thank you
14:12  solofight: 1000M is a good one, but wanted to know whether i can use G
14:12  solofight: thank you Viper-7
14:12  solofight: Viper-7++
14:13 +Viper-7: heh
14:13 +Viper-7: you're capped at about 2gb tho remember
14:13  further: hi, I am writing a php extension, is there any output buffer implemented in zend source? so that I can use it instead of rewriting a new one.
14:13 +Viper-7: you cant do more than that over http - at least without recompiling your webserver & php to 64 bit
14:13 +Viper-7: and you shouldnt really do more than ~50mb of uploads over http imo
14:14 +Viper-7: its not a file transport protocol ;)
14:14  Keloran: *repeats Viper-7's last 2 lines*
14:14 +Viper-7: further: #php.pecl on efnet
14:14 +Viper-7: they'll be much more helpful for extension development
14:14  solofight: Viper-7, capped at 2Gb ?
14:14 +Viper-7: solofight: 32 bit signed integer limit
14:14  solofight: you mean i cannot upload a file more than 2 GB ?
14:15  further: Viper-7: thx.
14:15  solofight: OMG
14:15 +Viper-7: php has trouble dealing with any files larger than like 2.1gb
14:15 +Viper-7: as do most webserver
14:15 +Viper-7: as do most clients
14:15 +Viper-7: etc
14:15  solofight: Viper-7, so what do we do in that case ?
14:15  solofight: whats the alternative or fix ?
14:16 +Viper-7: solofight: use a different protocol. ftp? scp? tftp? etc
14:16 +Viper-7: im sure there's flash/java/js (tho probably html5 only) solutions for most of those
14:16 +Viper-7: to handle the client side
14:17  Keloran: theres defentlly a flash one for ftp
14:18  winmutt: hi
14:18  winmutt: gd doesnt seem to want to provide jpeg support
14:18 +Viper-7: winmutt: its possible to compile gd without libjpeg support - but i'd call that a broken install heh
14:18  winmutt: i am on debian and have compiled my own php from src
14:19  winmutt: i guess ill just roll my own then
14:19 +Viper-7: add
14:19 +Viper-7: --with-jpeg-dir --with-png-dir
14:19 +Viper-7: to your configure
14:19  Keloran: did you compile with jpeg supprot ?
14:19 +Viper-7: you dont need to specify the actual paths
14:19 +Viper-7: apt-get install libjpeg62-dev libjpeg62 libpng12-dev
14:19 +Viper-7: for the dependencies for those
14:20  dr0id: sudo apt-get....

14:39  codec: i thought thats called oracle
14:39  codec: *scnr*
14:39  prgmrBill: ha ha ha
14:40  ccapndave: Guess that means no :(
14:43  ajavid: good morning
14:45  orangey: hello all!
14:45  orangey: I'm having trouble with something that sounds like it should be easy: playing with arrays.
14:45  orangey: : )
14:45  orangey: What I want is the "getVolume()" object from $issueDao->getIssueById('14')
14:46  orangey: unfortunately, there's a layer in this PHP program that seems to be returning the object only as a variable.
14:46  orangey: thereby causing a fatal error
14:47  orangey: I'm wondering if there's one construction that would give me the getVolume for IssueId 14 in object issueDao
14:47  orangey: $issueDao->getIssueById('14')->getVolume()?
14:49  orangey: (obviously the above doesn't work)
14:50  Shadow: Hi, I have this, if (THIS_SCRIPT == 'osc_shop') {  .Is there a way that if the THIS_SCRIPT was equal to osc_shop1 or osc_shop2 etc, it would execute.
14:50  salathe: you're playing with arrays?
14:51  Shadow: <salathe> is that for me
14:51  salathe: nop
14:51  Shadow: np
14:52  salathe: i can't type that quickly
14:52  prgmrBill: Shadow: if( in_array(THIS_SCRIPT, array('foo', 'bar')) )
14:52  prgmrBill: Shadow: switches also work and if/elseif or an if with the OR operator
14:53  prgmrBill: I think switches are purdy
14:53  Shadow: <prgmrBill> not using arrays
14:53  prgmrBill: okay, so the three other approaches still apply
14:53  prgmrBill: I'm not sure why you'd avoid arrays though
14:53  prgmrBill: they sure are useful
14:54  orangey: prgmrBill: he likes purdy
14:54  salathe: arrays are purdy too
14:54  prgmrBill: any code that doesn't use arrays is not purdy imo
14:54  prgmrBill: it's deliberately crippling yourself
14:54  Shadow: Basically each file has a line like: define('THIS_SCRIPT', osc_shop);
14:54  orangey: arrays are like beautiful hot women
14:55  ajavid: no they are not.
14:55  ajavid: Not at all.
14:55  ajavid: But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
14:55  Shadow: another file would have define('THIS_SCRIPT', osc_shop1);  etc
14:55  orangey: they're great, and you'd love them when they work out. BUT DAMN, they are fickle
14:55  orangey: and make you want to pull your hair out
14:55  ajavid: haha
14:55  djmccormick: array like a beautiful hot woman: [ . ][ . ]
14:55  orangey: just like my current array/object problem
14:56  Shadow: How how do I have something like,   if (THIS_SCRIPT == 'osc_shop*') {
14:56  sacho: "arrays are fickle"?
14:56  salathe: orangey: how is your current problem related to arrays?
14:56  sacho: Shadow: use substr
14:57  ajavid: djmccormick, with square breasteses
14:57  sacho: substr(THIS_SCRIPT, 8) == 'osc_shop'
14:57  ajavid: ?
14:57  ajavid: robot chics.
14:57  orangey: salathe: let me start by saying I'm an idiot. However, if I'm trying to get getVolume() from $issueDao->getIssueById('14'), aren't I essentially diving deep into arrays?
14:57  salathe: sacho: you sure about that substr?
14:57  ajavid: ( . )( . ) <- not square.
14:57  sacho: I really hate it when people refer to computers as having feelings, and whatever not.
14:57  ajavid: sacho, why not?
14:57  sacho: salathe: you're right, substr(..., 0, 8)
14:57  orangey: sacho: It helps people make sense of the world. Whatever works.
14:57  ajavid: sacho, there is nothing wrong with anthropomorphsizing electronics
14:58  salathe: orangey: maybe, maybe not... but you're working on objects not arrays
14:58  Shadow: <sacho> what exactly will that do
14:58  sacho: orangey: arrays aren't "fickle"
14:58  djmccormick: nah ajavid push 'em together buddy (  .  Y  .  )
14:58  sacho: your understanding of them might be
14:58  ajavid: As Chuck Schuldiner puts it
14:58  ajavid: "Individual Thought Patterns"
14:58  sacho: Shadow: it will check if the first 8 characters in THIS_SCRIPT are equal to 'osc_shop'..?
14:59  orangey: salathe: Hence my referral to it as an array/object problem : ) Notwithstanding, is there any way to dive into objects, so that a subobject of a subobject is accessed?
14:59  Shadow: so substr(THIS_SCRIPT, 0, 8) == 'osc_shop'
14:59  salathe: orangey: sure, just do what you were doing :P
15:00  LabMonkey: wtb easy-to-use MVC AJAX framework working today
15:00  orangey: salathe: hehehe ; ) I'm here because it wasn't working!

15:01 --- Putr|Away is now known as Putr
15:01  orangey: salathe: I'm essentially playing with templates, and I've already gone into the core enough times. But if I can't get this done in some reasonable way, then that's a major core chunk that needs rewriting. The essence of the problem is that the core sanitizes my variable {assign var=blah value=blah} into I believe something unusable
15:01 * LabMonkey quacks.
15:02 * ss23 throws a wild duckling at LabMonkey 
15:02  salathe: orangey: i still have no idea what you want or have :|
15:02  JdGordon: really noob question... is "curl_setopt ($curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?action=login2");" wrong? without "?action=login2" it works, with it, nope
15:02  sacho: orangey: "diving" and "subojects" are terms that are not defined for a general object
15:03  LabMonkey: oh
15:03  LabMonkey: Why I'm asking this is kind of an involved explanation, but...
15:03  orangey: salathe: this is the "object" that should come back: http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/doxygen/html/classIssue.html
15:03  sacho: JdGordon: define wrong, and "works", and "not works"
15:03  prgmrBill: JdGordon: that argument should be a URL. if you want get arguments use the post fields argument
15:03  LabMonkey: What's that mythical creature that looks normal/human if you're looking directly at it but when you're not looking it's a monster?
15:03  prgmrBill: and set tthe type to get
15:03  Shadow: thanks for the help
15:03  orangey: salathe: with one of the "public member functions" being getVolume()
15:04  salathe: orangey: ok so why doesn't what you've got work?
15:05  JdGordon: prgmrBill: bah, thanks :) /me is a very tired not-web dev :)
15:05  ajavid: yes
15:05  ajavid: it is raining
15:05  ajavid: ! beautiful morning
15:06  prgmrBill: JdGordon: np
15:06  orangey: salathe: Well, I'm working not within the core (where it would work), but within a *template*, which I suspect is sanitizing what the var can come back as. To assign a variable, I have to execute: {assign var=issue2 value=$issueDao->getIssueById('14')}
15:06  orangey: however, issue2 cannot be manipulated in any way. I can't say $issue2->getVolume(), for example.
15:07  orangey: The error I get is: registered 'issue2' is not an object
15:07  salathe: orangey: ok
15:07  salathe: orangey: so make a new variable for the volume
15:09  orangey: salathe: I just tried: {assign var=issue2 value=$issueDao->getIssueById('14') \ {assign var=issue3 value=$issue2->getVolume()}
15:09  orangey: but now get a different error message when I try to display $issue3
15:09  orangey: syntax error: unrecognized tag 'issue3' (Smarty_Compiler.class.php
15:10  salathe: orangey: how about {assign var=volume value=$issueDao->getIssueById('14')->getVolume()}
15:10  j0nr: I have a mysql table, with (for example) a column called 'name'. rows under 'name' contain '1', '2', '3', '4', '4'. I am using: while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)) { echo $row['name'] }   to produce a list of 'name'. How can I prevent it from repeating '4' as '4' shows up twice. I don't want duplications
15:11  davidthedrake: j0nr: maintain an array of values that have already been output and check before you echo
15:11  j0nr: I was thinking of building a temporary list and ... davidthedrake I thought so
15:11  prophile: alternatively, modify your query
15:12  davidthedrake: *nod* or, modify your query so you don't have dupes :)
15:12  prophile: which I would suggest is preferable, as it means transferring less data from your database
15:12  prophile: I suggest looking up 'distinct' in the MySQL documentation
15:12  j0nr: so how can I iterate each row in a while loop and simultaneously check for duplication?
15:13  prophile: s/suggest/recommend/
15:13  j0nr: aha
15:13  orangey: salathe: doesn't work either. I think I need to go back to the core and make sure everything is solid. Thank you very much.
15:13  salathe: orangey: no problemo
15:14  j0nr: prophile: thanks, I see more clearly now
15:14  prophile: you're welcome
15:16  orangey: salathe: indeed a typo in my core crept up about 15 minutes ago
15:16  orangey: though it still doesn't work, but the errors are getting more reasonable.
15:16  j0nr: prophile: stunning, a simple fix (adding one word) I like it :)
15:18  orangey: salathe: SUCCESS!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much for your help
15:18  salathe: orangey: :)

15:25  philsturgeon: Hey guys, throwing something out here which annoyingly will probably just end up getting flamed, but try to hold back.
15:25  philsturgeon: would any of you post scripts to CodeCanyon if it wasn't such a rip-off for the developer?
15:26 --- cescalante is now known as ce_afk
15:26 --- imphasing_ is now known as imphasing
15:27  Myztik: Why would it be a rip-off and that's off-topic
15:27  philsturgeon: by rip-off i mean, the developer gets 50%
15:27  philsturgeon: that's only just up from 40%
15:27  dr0id: where ?
15:27  philsturgeon: they change it a month back :)
15:27  dr0id: seems like some interesting convo goin on :)
15:27  philsturgeon: http://codecanyon.net/
15:27  Myztik: and in return they give you a massive exposure to customers
15:27  dr0id: yeah, that's a rip-off :P
15:28  dr0id: lets open our own marketplace where we would give 80% to the devs/designers, what do ya say ?
15:28  philsturgeon: Myztik: yes, thats why it works. but right now they can charge that much because they are the only real option
15:28  philsturgeon: dr0id: i have that in place already. im looking for a little more seed content
15:29  dr0id: seed content ?
15:29  philsturgeon: i have a few people interested, business plans, marketing people on hold, a bunch of content, a design, etc. i need a few guys that dont mind knocking out some simple scripts and throwing em on the site
15:29  philsturgeon: seed content = launch content
15:29  dr0id: ic
15:29  philsturgeon: think http://devot-ee.com/ for Ruby, PHP, jQuery, etc
15:30  dr0id: I had planned to start such website, but it's difficult you know, envato has a good grip over the market
15:30  philsturgeon: thats the guy helping me :)
15:30  dr0id: awesome userbase, so they won :P
15:30  philsturgeon: dr0id: ahh yes indeed. the joy of what im offering here is that we dont expect exclusivity
15:30  philsturgeon: and we give people 80%
15:30  philsturgeon: so throw your code on both, who gives a f**k.
15:31  philsturgeon: and, you dont have to worry about the plan. make some random code and we sell it :D
15:31  imphasing: I'm guessing the chan ops aren't going to love the idea of you pimpin out your product here.
15:31  philsturgeon: i just need a few more people interested in providing content
15:31  imphasing: "Give me free code" <- this isn't a good plan for this channel, methinks.
15:31  philsturgeon: imphasing: im trying to get in touch with a large number of php developers. thats basically it
15:32  prophile: this is going against channel guideline 7
15:32  dr0id: philsturgeon: anyone buying yet ?
15:32  imphasing: I get it dude. This is more than likely the wrong place though.
15:32  philsturgeon: imphasing: not at all, i'll take it private, email and contract up anyone that wishes to work with me. just explaining the plan in full so people can make up their minds
15:32  dr0id: philsturgeon: the discussion is cool for me
15:32  dr0id: some people are probably hating the fact that you will become rich soon lol
15:32  philsturgeon: lol i'll shut it now guys, IRC seems a bad way to go about this. people generally end up complaining. Twitter works brilliantly but hard to explain it properly and have a real-time discussion
15:33  prgmrBill: philsturgeon: it's not the fact that it's irc, it's that you're asking people to code for free
15:33  sacho: IRC is not a bad way.
15:33  dr0id: philsturgeon: any sales you having yet
15:33  imphasing: Not welcoming solicitors in a community channel and complaining are highly different things.
15:33  sacho: This channel is.
15:33  prgmrBill: many of us make careers out of this
15:33  philsturgeon: im not asking for code for free, of course not!
15:33  philsturgeon: im asking if people are interested in providing seed content, that is paid for
15:34 @cythrawll: philsturgeon, no recruiting
15:34  philsturgeon: i have been building up a passive income using sites like this for a long time, i just want an option for PHP developers that isn;t a rip-off
15:34  imphasing: Whether there's money involved or not doesn't seem very pertinent.
15:34  philsturgeon: cythrawll: fair enough
15:35  philsturgeon: didnt want to cause any trouble, just struggling with content and this seemed like a good "last ditch" :)
15:35 @cythrawll: turns out you were wrong
15:35  philsturgeon: ./shuts his face
15:38  u0m3: can anyone think of any reason why text send to a php script via xmlhttp would have issues with the "+"(plus) character?
15:38  prgmrBill: u0m3: define issues
15:38  NiLon: u0m3 most likely because + is ommited with integers
15:38 @cythrawll: u0m3, url decoding is turning it into a space?
15:38  NiLon: or that
15:38  u0m3: prgmrBill: well it's transformed in a white space
15:39  prgmrBill: sounds like you have your answer
15:39 @cythrawll: ooh what do I win?
15:39  u0m3: cythrawll: yes kind of... tho I use encodeURIComponent
15:39 @cythrawll: doesn't sound like it's encoding + signs right then
15:43  u0m3: cythrawll: I tested the java script and it works.. eg: C++ is encoded as C%2B%2B
15:43  u0m3: cythrawll: s/java script/javascript/
15:43 @cythrawll: u0m3, are you double decoding then?
15:43  u0m3: cythrawll: don't think so... I can show you the javascript code.
15:43 @cythrawll: u0m3, it's the server side part I'm worried about
15:44 @cythrawll: not encoding DECODING
15:45  u0m3: cythrawll: I don't have access to the code right now but it's: escape all quotes, exchange \r\n|\r|\n with <br />, insert in database
15:45  u0m3: so I figure something wen't wrong in "insert in database"

15:58  LabMonkey: The problem is... There isn't room in the budget for me to develop MVC controls from scratch.
15:58  Vienzzion: anyone here knows a good fast php framework
15:58  LabMonkey: Viper-7: Apply more cynicism.
16:00  stoned: vienzzion, we really don't.
16:00  stoned: vienzzion, but I bet google does.
16:00  stoned: vienzzion, /msg php-bot frameworks
16:01  stoned: labmonkey, I think it was appropriate
16:01  Vienzzion: let me see
16:01  stoned: viper-7, I call it 'Buzzard compliance'
16:01  stoned: ;) (say Buzz word really fast... buzzard buzzard)
16:02  stoned: I think a buzzard is like a Vulture maybe

16:02  Northwoods: hi stoned
16:02  stoned: Hello northwoods long time no see
16:02  stoned: demegeek, please do not /msg me
16:02  Northwoods: yeah long time no seige
16:02  dr0id: huh
16:03  stoned: northwoods, I made a facebook app after... 2 years
16:03  stoned: They changed the whole php-sdk around, and its using a brand new api system
16:03  Northwoods: after 2 years ?
16:03  stoned: yes
16:03  Northwoods: ah ok
16:03  stoned: I haven't made an fb in two years
16:03  stoned: so they changed a lot of stuf around
16:04  stoned: Hip hop!
16:04  stoned: hahahahaha
16:12  ace_me_: php store anywhere the lastr error ?
16:14  stoned: ace_me_, log
16:14  stoned: ace_me_, try apache's error.log and also in php.ini you can specify where to log php errors
16:14  stoned: ace_me_, check the manual
16:14  ace_me_: so no command store error
16:15  stoned: im sorry?
16:15  stoned: you want to see php give errors?
16:15  stoned: ace_me_, /msg php error reporting
16:15  stoned: ace_me_, /msg php-bot error reporting
16:18  IDT: what is php-bot?? is it a bot written in php or sth ?? it's not givig me /version ..
16:19  stoned: he is a python based factoid bot
16:19  stoned: you can send him messages to get pre written facts and answers so people don't have to type them over and over again
16:20  Keloran: e.g. rule 8
16:20  stoned: do /msg php-bot guidelines
16:20  IDT: ah .. i tried to /msg (him) but no anserr
16:20  IDT: i'll try this
16:21  stoned: idt, it only responds to factoid's key/val pair. You type in key, it gives your val. You have to know the factoid name. I'm not sure if this is info or bloot
16:21  stoned: either of those would have listkeys and listvals directives
16:21  Keloran: yeah theres some in there that are just comedy
16:21  stoned: so that you can search the factoid db.
16:21  IDT: good .. it responded now :)
16:21  stoned: yay
16:21  IDT: sorry .. (he)
16:21  stoned: :)

16:24  feindbild: hi
16:25  feindbild: how do I get a child of a DOMElement by it's tagname?
16:26  u0m3: cythrawll: you said the bug might be on the server side... so here is the code. the fuction is "putcomments" http://codepad.org/NDiHZVw4
16:26  prophile: feindbild: http://www.php.net/manual/en/domelement.getelementsbytagname.php
16:27  feindbild: prophile: I want the children, not the descendants ...
16:27  knubbze: is it possible to undefine functions?
16:27  knubbze: like: function a() { return 1; } undefine(a); function a() { return 2; }
16:27  prgmrBill: isn't that called overloading?
16:28  ndee: I have following array: $foo[0][position]=4, $foo[1][position]=3, $foo[2][position]=2. Now I want to sort the array $foo according to the values in $foo[X][position]. How can I do that?
16:28  imphasing: prgmrBill: Well, overloading would imply that both would exist, and are callable, but the runtime decides which to call based on args.
16:28  u0m3: prgmrBill: overloading requires having different argument count/type
16:28  imphasing: I think he just wants to kill a function he defined.
16:29  prophile: knubbze: yeah it is
16:29  prgmrBill: I see
16:29  prophile: iff you have the runkit extension
16:29  domo: is it "correct" to have setFoo() or "setter" functions in a static class:  ie.    foo::setDir('some_dir/');
16:29  knubbze: hm nope
16:29  imphasing: It should be possible to undefine a function though.
16:29  knubbze: it isn't really important, I do have the option of freeing the entire php codebase before re-evaluating another command
16:30  knubbze: that would mean re-evaluating the interface at any call though
16:30  knubbze: hm
16:30  prophile: knubbze: what I've seen done, which is a little hacky but works
16:30  prophile: for long-running php processes
16:30  prophile: is to look up functions you want to redefine from an array
16:30  knubbze: going to write a custom vtable-esque manager
16:30  prophile: ie $callbacks['my_callback_name']
16:30  knubbze: yeah, that's what I am going to do, only I will do it not from userspace
16:31  prophile: then you can redefine them by just doing $callbacks['my_callback_name'] = function() { /* do different stuff */ }
16:31  knubbze: now it would only be useful to know if zend already has an interface to the userspace codebase
16:31  knubbze: i.e. extracting existing functions and their code
16:33  knubbze: hm, if function.die does call zend_bailout() then I might have another dirty work-around
16:33  knubbze: brb
16:34  knubbze: okay - another question, once I figured that one out I'll be gone for a while implementing this, I promise ;)
16:34  knubbze: is there a way to intercept userspace function calls
16:35  knubbze: just like ub_write, etc. are replaceable
16:36  Kuifje111: could anyone tell me what the at sign in @mysql_query(); means?
16:36  NiLon: @ = error supress
16:36  knubbze: it surpressed the error
16:37  Kuifje111: oh, ok. thanks.
16:37  NiLon: don't use it
16:37  NoiseEee: its a perfect way of making sure you never know what mistakes you are making
16:37  Kuifje111: so normally mysql_query postes an error if something goes wrong and with @ it doesnt post the error?
16:37  NiLon: knubbze runkit kind of does what you are looking for, tho that extension is not something that should be relied on
16:37  NoiseEee: Kuifje111: no
16:37  NoiseEee: Kuifje111: displays an error, yes
16:38  Kuifje111: ok.
16:38  NiLon: Kuifje111 @ hides the error if function can generate one, don't use it, use display_errors setting instead when moving to production
16:39  Kuifje111: ok, thanks
16:39  NiLon: error supression basically means that "let my code be broken and do fatal things"
16:39  NiLon: errors are not logged etc. also it slows down your code
16:40  NiLon: it's not toggeable so you need to modify your code to see possible errors, so it's not maintable
16:42  ickmund: does WWW-Authenticate use cookies to store PHP_AUTH_USER?
16:45  ickmund: I have a scenario where I do a www-auth on one page then forward to another page. One the second page, PHP_AUTH_USER is *usually* set, but never on my iPad. If I instead just print PHP_AUTH_USER on the first page, it's present
16:46  knubbze: does php come with a way of dumping its current state as php?
16:46  prgmrBill: state?
16:46  Keloran: ickmund: i think its held in a private session flag, since its passed by the authorize header
16:46  knubbze: e.g. $a = 5; function b() { return 5; } $code = DUMP(); would yield: $code = "$a = 5; function b() { return 5; }"
16:47  prgmrBill: I think the closest thing to that would be a trace string
16:47  ickmund: Keloran, any idea why it wouldn't work on the iPad? I can't find anyone else with this problem, so I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong...
16:48  NoiseEee: ickmund: what about using sessions
16:48  ace_me_: how to ensure that two arrays are equal and they are same type
16:48  ace_me_: === ?
16:48  knubbze: hm
16:49  knubbze: prgmrBill: that would work from userspace only
16:49  Keloran: is on the same domain (as in your going from www.asda to www.asda) because i think iOS doesnt like it when you change subdomin .e.g www.asda => images.asda
16:49  khinester: hello, how does the get_browser() function determines if the USER-AGENT has javascript enabled or not?
16:50  ickmund: I'm doing the testing on IP even, so no domain changes
16:51  thadin: khinester: "Attempts to determine the capabilities of the user's browser, by looking up the browser's information in the browscap.ini  file. "  http://php.net/get_browser
16:51  Keloran: maybe ios just doesnt like it then, possible that mobile-safari really doesnt like it
16:51  ickmund: NoiseEee, I would usually roll with sessions (and not use www-authenticate either), but it's on a legacy system and while I could tell them a re-write is in order, it would never be approved to be fixed for iPad only...
16:52  FFForever: Good morning
16:53  NoiseEee: ickmund: if you can't find similar issues on the google, i'd assume you're doing something wrong.  maybe linking to a file in a (differnet) protected directory or something
16:53  onomi: hello
16:53  FFForever: Is it possible to create an array with the same keyvalue multiple times? like array('item' => array(), 'item' => array())
16:53  NoiseEee: ickmund: it would be highly unlikely for you to be the first person with this issue this far into ipad / iOS4 :)
16:54  Keloran: ickmund: http://lightyearsoftware.com/blog/2010/05/remember-http-password-in-mobile-safari/
16:54  NoiseEee: Keloran: ouch
16:54  ickmund: Is it common practice to always issue the www-auth-headers if $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] isn't set? Because this actually works... IE, on second page, if PHP_AUTH_USER is not set, issue www-auth, then print PHP_AUTH_USER. It's now set, and I don't get challenged.
16:54  onomi: im using xpath('/item/person') and there isnt a <person> in any item, but xpath returned an Array(), is that right? if yes... how can i guess if a <person> exists ? :S
16:55  NoiseEee: onomi: my guess is that the array would actually have contents
16:55  onomi: nope
16:55  onomi: im print_ring
16:56  NoiseEee: onomi: you're saying its not returning anything but there IS a <person>?  if thats the case your query is wrong
16:56  prgmrBill: FFForever: I think that would either not work or overwrite the value
16:56  prgmrBill: pretty sure you can't do it
16:56  ickmund: Keloran, But that is only for saving the data in the browser so I don't have to re-type it every time I visit the site (and has been logged out)
16:56  onomi: no, there isnt a person but calling xpath with that query returned an empty array, instead return false or something...
16:56  Keloran: onomi: you can ask its nodelength
16:57  onomi: nodelenght, let me google it
16:58  NoiseEee: onomi: right, im saying if there IS a <person> then the array will not be empty
16:58  NoiseEee: check the LENGTH of whats returned, not true/false
16:58  Keloran: onomi: http://us2.php.net/manual/en/class.domnodelist.php
16:59  khinester: thadin: but the map to javascript how is this done? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields there is no field javascript
17:00  thadin: khinester: no, see that browsercap file
17:00  salathe: onomi: you're using SimpleXML?
17:00  onomi: salathe: yes, http://pastie.org/private/xypk384zv196nun1nkxnow
17:00  ace_me_: how mysql_real_query() differ from mysql_query ?
17:01  onomi: so next to this im doing print_r with the returned $error
17:01  onomi: and its an empty array
17:02  sarfios: Hello
17:02  davidthedrake: ace_me_: mysql_real_query() isn't a PHP function
17:02  NoiseEee: onomi: why $error[0] and not $error?
17:02  NoiseEee: also, "return $error" ?
17:02  sarfios: I got a little problem, I've installed joomla, and then one tamplate with name ja purity 2, but when i've tried to enter the site it's write me that
17:02  NoiseEee: n/m that last part
17:02  sarfios: Fatal error: Call to undefined function: overload() in /home/www/tehamv.com/www/templates/ja_purity_ii/libs/ja.obj.extendable.php on line 39
17:02  klusias: hello. i got some problem with ldap + php..i got lot of user entries, where [dn] = CN=User Name,OU=Agents,OU=_Groupname, but some of them is without OU=_Groupname...how can i check is, OU=_Groupname in [dn]? without strpos...
17:02  aidan: How can I set the path that is searched when running an exec() call?
17:03  Keloran: onomi: ask for its length, since it returns an array, you can perform count on it
17:03  NoiseEee: sigh
17:03  NoiseEee: sarfios: check joomla support
17:04  stoned: sarfios, $joomla
17:04  stoned: doh
17:04  stoned: #joola
17:04  stoned: seriously?
17:04  sarfios: what
17:04  stoned: I give up.
17:04  stoned: #joomla.
17:04  sarfios: i've write there, but no one was able to help
17:05  azazul: because its too damn hard to understand what you're saying
17:05  sarfios: xDD
17:05  NoiseEee: sarfios: well we can't help you here, we don't support joomla/anything other than homegrown PHP
17:05  sarfios: Well, sorry for my poor english...
17:05  cj101: hi
17:05  aidan: sarfios: this is about programming in PHP, your question has nothing to do with that, go away.
17:06  stoned: aidan, there is no reason to be mean
17:06  aidan: sarfios: sorry, not to be mean :)
17:06  LabMonkey: says the pot
17:06  stoned: Then don't be.
17:06  azazul: LabMonkey++
17:06  sarfios: stoned, thanks i don't mind it...
17:06  cj101: ive just enabled uploadprogress on my php server but i cant find any docs on php.net about how to use it. anyone got any ideas?
17:06  stoned: apparently I'm the pot...
17:06  NoiseEee: cj101: what is uploadprogress?
17:07  khinester: i don't get this, get_browser() function depends on the setting set on my browser, if USER-AGENT headers sent does not include javascript how is this determined?
17:07  aidan: cj101: heh, no, it's so undocumented. Have a look at the Drupal source code for an example.
17:07  cj101: http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress
17:07  stoned: Not sure how I've ever been mean to anyone while supporting or told someone to just go away without at least pointing them in the right direction
17:07  Keizer: Hey guys
17:07  aidan: khinester: what's user-agent have to do with javascript?
17:07  Keizer: Which pdf library is the most opensource/best performing for PHP
17:08  Keizer: I seen PDFLib but it says my program has to fall under the OpenSource Initiative list of projects
17:08  aidan: Keizer: they all suck. I've used tcpdf and it successfully wrote the PDF, but that's all the praise I would give it.
17:08  Keizer: lol
17:08  Keloran: i love that, most opensource, or best performing
17:08  abstrakt: sarfios: try #joomla
17:08 --- ChanServ sets modes [##php +o cyth]
17:08  Keizer: aidan: I will look into that
17:08  stoned: abstrakt, you're the 3rd person to say that :)
17:08  NoiseEee: cj101: its a PECL package; you won't find any documentation in the php manual
17:09  abstrakt: stoned: not surprised
17:09  aidan: NoiseEee: most PECL packages are documented in the PHP manual
17:09  stoned: abstrakt, yet here he is :)
17:09  abstrakt: stoned: again, not surprised, look at where we are
17:09  NoiseEee: aidan: not well
17:09  cj101: aidan, but not this one?
17:09  stoned: abstrakt, exactly.
17:09  aidan: cj101: nope, sorry.
17:09  khinester: aidan: http://php.net/manual/fr/function.get-browser.php [javascript] => 1
17:09  stoned: ai dan, artifically intelligent dan
17:09  stoned: hehe
17:10  aidan: khinester: JS information is not usually sent in the UA. It's guessed from a huge library of browser information. You can't rely on it, instead use functional based sniffing.
17:10  azazul: khinester: yeah , because browsers only tell the truth
17:10  azazul: its stupid to check for JS on php side
17:11  IDT: i am trying to do this http://ajaxpatterns.org/HTTP_Streaming#Goal_Story
17:11  IDT: is it practical (from the resource pov) to keep a connection open between every open page and the server (which will be idle most of the time) ?
17:11  onomi: Keloran: NoiseEee: ok i think its not the problem, maybe a CDATA, look at this: http://pastie.org/private/qxaanjgqtwekwa4hxfuj7g
17:11  cj101: aidan, is there anywhere that does have docs on it?
17:11  aidan: IDT: no
17:12  aidan: IDT: you need to use something other than PHP for Comet programming
17:12  IDT: ah ..
17:12  khinester: so get_browser() makes a test on the browser to see if javascript is on or off when a user makes a request?
17:13  aidan: IDT: I recommend Twisted, Medusa, Tornado or even Node.js
17:13  IDT: aidan: i thought so, but hoped otherwise .. thanks .
17:13  aidan: khinester: no, did I say that? did anyone say that?
17:15  Keloran: khinester: the capfile just says "JavaScript=true", so it might not
17:16  stoned: this is php
17:16  stoned: oops
17:16  IDT: aidan: as i can see, every possible solution includes a custom server (no shared hosting where i most my clients are)
17:16  Keloran: khinester: you dont really need to care about javascript beign turned on or not if you follow the guidelines of Progressive Enhancment, make it work like its a text browser to start, and then add on extra caps if they browser can accept them
17:16  stoned: shared hosting sucks
17:16  stoned: why does it even exist
17:16  khinester: Keloran: ok this is where i got twisted
17:16  LabMonkey: Why are you so closed-minded?
17:17  NoiseEee: onomi: take your xml/query to http://www.whitebeam.org/library/guide/TechNotes/xpathtestbed.rhtm and play ther
17:17  stoned: labmonkey, why are you so serious?
17:17 @cyth: IDT, nah, it depends on what you use for an application container.
17:17  Keloran: onomi: if it returns a simplexml object, you can ask it, hasChildren ?
17:17  IDT: stoned: i know .. nut i can't force any of my software buyers to get a server
17:17 @cyth: IDT, for example I wouldn't need a custom server because I use tomcat, which can do comet just fine.
17:17  stoned: imagine if one server was hacked. He has access to however many sites are stord on that server
17:18 * LabMonkey quacks.
17:18  stoned: its not a matter of taste, its a matter of freaking security, not to mention server resources and other technical shortcomings
17:18  stoned: technoloical*
17:18  stoned: worrying about those issues is not being close minded.
17:18  IDT: cyth: tomcat can save me ?? thats good news cuz most shared hosts offers it as an option ..
17:19  onomi: NoiseEee: invalid, error, can u help me to find the error?
17:19  stoned: idt, vps or cloud is good
17:19  IDT: so i just implement the live part in java :D
17:19  stoned: :D
17:19  aidan: IDT: have a look at what Drupal does, it does not include a custom server
17:19 @cyth: IDT, yeah iirc it has to be tomcat 6+
17:20 @cyth: aidan, what drupal does is technically bad.
17:20  stoned: you can actually deploy server virtual machines on clouds (not sure if you knew that) and it cost only a few dolalrs more than share dhosting.
17:20  IDT: aidan: i am trying to avoid doing what drupal does
17:20  LabMonkey: stoned: I dare you to cease stating opinions for one hour.
17:20  aidan: stoned: so you're actually advocating people manage their own servers on a security standpoint? lol.
17:21 @cyth: aidan, some of us are better at that than most web hosting companies
17:21  stoned: we're developers, not shared hosting users who know nothing.
17:21  aidan: cyth: right, which is why I have my own servers
17:21  aidan: but there is obviously a case for shared hosting
17:21  LabMonkey: Being a developer does not necessitate administrative duties.
17:21  stoned: so yes, in our context, I would advise manaing your own security
17:21  IDT: believe me i know .. but i am still stuck with a bunch of clients who insist to use shared hosting ..
17:21  NoiseEee: but most websites aren't exactly designed/coded by 'developers'
17:21  NoiseEee: aidan's point is quite valid
17:21  stoned: no, but being a good developer does.
17:21 @cyth: shared hosting is good for people's personal blogs and sites.
17:22  NoiseEee: most people, even developers, know shit all about best practices for linux security
17:22 @cyth: it should never be used for anything concerning business
17:22  stoned: idt, i am too unfortunately
17:22 @cyth: unless the risk is worth the low price
17:22  IDT: +1 for NoiseEee
17:22  stoned: idt, bu those client are only using blogs or wordpress etc. to its cool, not high traffic or anything
17:22 @cyth: not to mention how extremely limited you are ina  shared host
17:22  LabMonkey: Being a good developer does not necessitate administrative duties.  That's what datacenter personnel are for.
17:22  stoned: neccessitate?
17:22  aidan: Speaking of the cloud, I can't recommend rackspace cloud servers enough if anyone is in the market. Being able to fire up a VM through a python script on my desktop ROCKS.
17:22  LabMonkey: necessitate*
17:23 @cyth: LabMonkey, only to a point.
17:23 @cyth: you can't be a good developer and not know how to configure atleast yoru web stack securely.
17:23  stoned: cyth, thank you.
17:23 @cyth: *web developer
17:23 @cyth: now, there are plenty of developers who can't, but we can't call them good :p
17:24  imphasing: lol, "cloud." People need to get over these buzzwords and just call it managed virtual hosting or something.
17:24  LabMonkey: cyth: An application can provide as much security as is available to its runtime environment.  An application cannot, for example, prevent people from breaking into your building and physically tampering with hardware.
17:24  stoned: imphasing, cloud is one word
17:24  stoned: imphasing, youre suggestin we use 3 insetd of one?
17:24 @cyth: LabMonkey, that goes beyond the web stack
17:24  stoned: imphasing, that does away with the whole giving things a short sweet name logic
17:24 @cyth: so that's not included
17:24  Keloran: bah who needs security, bugs like that are only features waiting to be discoverd, how else will the candy unicorn get fed....erm or somet to that effect
17:24  stoned: hehe
17:24  imphasing: stoned: Cloud is a stupid word for that tech, so yeah.
17:24  stoned: imphasing, i think its cute
17:24  stoned: I like clouds.
17:24  Cryp71c: Given that I have Class A which Inherits from Class B. Class B has a method test(), can I overload B's implementation of test with a more relevant implementation of test() in class A?
17:25  stoned: I have no problem with the word, its a silly thing to argue about
17:25  imphasing: It's a buzzword for the sake of being a buzzword. I hate "AJAX" too.

21:23  Alan_Hicks: git__: Only the most rudimentary ones. I've been kinda side-swiped by this suddenly.
21:33 @caffinated: git__: PHP6 is largely irrelevant as it doesn't even have a production release yet.
21:33  chachan: Hi, everyone, I'm trying to createmulti independent processes using exec from the parent process and fork from the child process, but the exec function doesn't realese the control, instead of releasing it waits for the output
21:34  chachan: is there a way to release the exec function calling, so, I can call many exec function, is that clear enough?
21:35  chachan: I really don't care wheather I have to use exec or another function, I just want to make many call to external scripts
21:37  hmd: Alan_Hicks, don't worry, everyone is "stuck" on PHP5 :P
21:37  hmd: Alan_Hicks, PHP6 doesn't have a release.
21:38  NiLon: there's no php 6 at all
21:38  hmd: Technically..
21:38  hmd: There is :/
21:39  NoiseEee: chachan: as you can see, php really isn't the best language for what you want to do.  consider doing that via CRON if you can
21:39  Alan_Hicks: hmd: Ah. :-) I hadn't even looked. I'm forced to use 5.2.x right now. If 5.3 is out then 6 is way out.
21:40  hmd: Alan_Hicks, 5.3 is starting to gain adoption. It's on the horizon.
21:40  chachan: I have this: http://fpaste.org/cmti/
21:40  hmd: Alan_Hicks, 5.2 is realistic ;)
21:40  hmd: chachan, if you mean parallel/asynchronous process calls, proc_open/popen/process_open
21:40  pteague_work: 5.3 is worth it if you can get 5.3
21:40  hmd: chachan, I do forget which one was the best, but one of these.
21:41  pteague_work: it has goto statements
21:41  hmd: pteague_work, how could we forget.

21:52  prgmrBill: what if I am definitely in object context and I get Using $this when not in object context?
21:52  domo: then you're not in an object
21:52  domo: paste some code ;)
21:53  dp: php is segfaulting on me; is there a way to have php output debug stuff until such time as it segfaults?
21:54  prgmrBill: so bizarre
21:54  prgmrBill: I changed Class::method to $class->method
21:54  prgmrBill: and it worked
21:54  Strav: hmd: here: http://pastebin.com/HXr6jWwD
21:54  prgmrBill: so I'm guessing if you try to call a method statically when it's not static, you get that cryptic error message
21:55  hmd: prgmrBill, yea, very cryptic :P
21:56  Strav: (of course, I've stripped irrelevant code from it)
21:56  deadowl: the this variable in javascript is wierd
21:57  b1lly: lets say I have a string like .... brakes_bendix_price                    is there like an instring command to grab between the two "_" underscores? so that it returnns bendix
21:57  garrett__: What's the favored method of running unit tests for things that need to interact with the db?  use pdo and a local sqlite?
21:57  garrett__: and write your code using PDO or something so you can interchange the underlying bits?
21:57  Strav: Now since php is evaluated, I would have guessed that $this->validator would be resolved as an object.
21:57  prgmrBill: hmd: do you think that error message says "you called a method statically when you shouldn't have"?
21:57  prgmrBill: it really doesn't
21:58  hmd: prgmrBill, what does it say
21:58  prgmrBill: hmd: Using $this when not in object context?
21:58  prgmrBill: I guess perhaps they mean the object doesn't exist when called statically
22:00  b1lly: say $string = "brakes_bendix_price";   is there away to return what is inbetween the two underscores? so that I can return a value of "bendix"?
22:00  hmd: prgmrBill, this means you have not enabled E_STRICT which would directly complain about calling static method that is not static.
22:00  hmd: prgmrBill, instead it runs it and then it sees $this in a static call and it, naturally, s**ts itself.
22:00  prgmrBill: hmd: is that different than E_ALL? I have that on
22:01  themiddleman: Hi guys, is there an easy to convert a string formatted: '2010-10-20' to a timestamp?
22:01  hmd: prgmrBill, somehow E_ALL doesn't include E_STRICT you need to specify both E_ALL | E_STRICT
22:01  prgmrBill: themiddleman: strtotime
22:01  prgmrBill: b1lly: explode by _ and return the second array element
22:01  prgmrBill: hmd: awesome, thanks
22:01  themiddleman: prgmrBill: thanks
22:01  b1lly: orgrnvukk!!!!!!!!!!!
22:01  b1lly: prgmrBill: thx man
22:02  prgmrBill: np guys
22:02  Strav: May anyone take a look at this  http://pastebin.com/HXr6jWwD and tell my why can't php resolve $this->validator to an object? (btw the Validator class def isn't in the paste and that shouldn't matter, it instantiate correctly).
22:03  hmd: Strav, sorry for the delay. First thing I notice, aside from your issue: you changed the constructor signature, which is a bad idea.
22:03  hmd: Strav, I'll read more now.
22:06 --- cescalante is now known as ce_afk
22:06  Strav: hdm: it's really been a while since I touched php, so it's a bad idea to specify args to __construct()?
22:06  hmd: Strav, second thing I notice, $validator is private.
22:06  hmd: And private var are local to a class, make it protected, that's what you want.
22:06  hmd: private: only the class sees it;  protected: class and subclasses see it;  public: everyone sees it
22:07  ispirto: hey, how can i post an XML to an url by curl?
22:07  hmd: Strav, no, what's a bad idea is to make a subclass and change its *signature*
22:07  hmd: Strav, PHP will complain in some cases when it detect you do that.
22:07  hmd: detects*
22:08  hmd: Strav, a subclass can do more and have more methods, but it needs to be a strict superset of the parent class for those concerned that use it.
22:08  Strav: hdm: about the private keywords, before making scrapping my code, I was using accessors but perhaps now this is actually the problem.
22:08  hmd: Strav, pardon?
22:09  Strav: hdm: my properties were private and the subclass constructors used public setters and getters to set and get them.

22:16  ygip: Fatal error: Out of memory is what it said. i dont get the error right now
22:16  ygip: i found the error in a google search
22:16  ygip: ok
22:16  ispirto: anyone knows how i can post a xml to an api?
22:16  hmd: Ok wait.
22:16  hmd: This is not a memoty limit error, ygip.
22:17  hmd: That's a system eror.
22:17  ygip: oh?
22:17  ygip: i checked and my parallels machine said it had 755 memory left
22:17  ygip: 255 left
22:17  ygip: 25%
22:17  hmd: ygip, do you use WordPress with that SEO all-in-one extension?
22:17 --- Channel ##php was synced in 112 seconds
22:18  ygip: no, I use Qcodo framework, thats all
22:18  pteague_work: ispirto, curl would work
22:18  hmd: ygip, try to set your memory limit low and see if it dies.
22:19  hmd: ygip, if it does, it'll tell you when, and might orient you as to what the usage  comes from
22:19  ygip: good idea, but if it says "Fatal error: Out of memory" it's the OS deniying it ram?
22:19  hmd: ygip, if you set it low and you still get Out of Memory error, it *might* be a leak.
22:19  ispirto: pteague_work, http://pastebin.com/TUEbNt55 returns bad request error
22:20  dp: TML: still here?
22:22  hmd: ygip, let me check something
22:23  hmd: ygip, this is typically how a memory limit error looks like: Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 1048576 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 524289 bytes) in somefile.php on line 4
22:23  Ross: Important message:
22:23  Ross: http://twitter.com/wikileaks
22:23  Ross: Not realted, off topic, but...
22:23  Ross: related*
22:23  hmd: ygip, Out Of Memory I think means a system issue.
22:23  Ross: "WikiLeaks communications infrastructure is currently under attack. Project BO move to coms channel S. Activate Reston5."
22:23  hmd: ygip, i.e. leak, no RAM, something else takes RAM, something like that.
22:24  hmd: ygip, try with a low limit as I said, say, 16MB, and see how it goes.
22:24  pteague_work: ispirto, um, look at CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER for the headers & CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS for your $xml
22:25  ispirto: pteague_work, POSTFIELDS doesn't work
22:26  hmd: Ross, they like drama a lot.
22:26  ygip: its on 16mb now
22:26  hmd: ygip, does it manage to serve pages when you browser

22:26  hmd: browse*
22:26  hmd: ygip, yes it's at 16M
22:26  hmd: B
22:27  ygip: tried spamming it a bit
22:27  ygip: no errors
22:27  pteague_work: ispirto, are you sure? & are you sure your sample.xml is in the right format?
22:27  pteague_work: as it is .net... .net has weird issues
22:27  hmd: ygip, is there a page that may do something more complicated
22:27  ispirto: pteague, i've added content-length and worked now
22:27  Igoru: can i make questions about phpunit here?
22:27  ispirto: weird
22:31  hmd: Ross, the Pentagon is still using this language of "return the documents to us", as if someone physically went there and delivered papers :/
22:31  hmd: Some very old folks in there, it seems.
22:32  ygip: hmd, hmm i dont think it on any pages gets that much more complicated
22:32  victrolla: hmd, I think they want the documents 'returned' so they know exactly what wikileaks has. They're sort of scrambling to find out what everyone knows
22:35  hmd: victrolla, yes, I do find the way they formulate it slightly comic, though.

22:50  Ineluctable: I have two html select forms (http://fpaste.org/3OFM/)  The first select echos the menu names(i.e. menu 1, menu 2, etc...) and the second the page position in the menu (i.e. 1, 2, etc).  I need the second select form to display something like if menu one is selected then give the position(order) of the page you want to display under that menu.
22:50  Ineluctable: I have googeled for two days, and I am lost what would I search for or how would I do this?
22:51  kov: hey, I have a script that does this: "$command = $_GET['command'];" if command is not given in the GET request, though, the script errors out and logs something about undefined index; is there a setting I can use to disable this being strict?
22:51  Evil_Otto: check for $_GET['command'] being set first
22:52  Deltachaos: hmd: 0, 1, 0, 0 => black
22:52  Deltachaos:  0, 0, 1, 0 => red
22:52  Deltachaos:  0, 0, 0, 1 => green
22:52  Deltachaos: 1, 0, 0, 0 => black
22:52  kov: yeah, I'm aware of that, but can I make that work without changing the code? it does work on a couple other servers, so I'm wondering
22:52  NoiseEee: kov: turn down error reporting
22:52  Evil_Otto: it probably just doesn't report the error on the other servers
22:52 * Evil_Otto thwaps NoiseEee 
22:52  NoiseEee: thank you sir may i have another
22:52  Evil_Otto: he should fix the error :P
22:53  NoiseEee: obv!
22:53  Evil_Otto: change the code.
22:53  NoiseEee: but his request is "without changing the code"
22:53  hmd: Deltachaos, HSVA?
22:53  Evil_Otto: yeah well i'd like to request a pony but i'm not getting that either
22:53  kov: this code is part of a test suite, the tests pass on the other servers but not on this one (which has a newer php than the others, I'm almost certain)
22:54  kov: so I'm pretty sure there's a difference in behavior handling this case
22:54  Xyphoid: your error_reporting ini setting is different
22:54  Deltachaos: and 0, 0, 1, 1 => yellow
22:54  Deltachaos: hmd: can you give me an example
22:55  kov: Xyphoid, shouldn't error reporting affect just what is reported, and not how it behaves?
22:55  PointMan: !paste
22:55  PointMan: where can I paste code?
22:55  Deltachaos: PointMan: http://pastebin.org/
22:55  Xyphoid: if your code prints errors to screen, then error_reporting will absolutely affect how it behaves
22:55  NoiseEee: kov: http://php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php
22:56  NoiseEee: PointMan: pastebin of your choice
22:56  kov: the code does not report errors, no
22:56  NoiseEee: kov... read the link
22:56  kov: NoiseEee, on it!
22:58  Deltachaos: hmd: 0, 68, 48, 0 gives rgb(255, 0, 0) but it suld be in rgb(123, 39, 39)
22:58  Deltachaos: hmpf :(
22:59  kov: NoiseEee, so that seems to be indeed related only to error printing, not to how it behaves, or am I missing something?
22:59  kov: this is the file, by the way: http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/LayoutTests/http/tests/resources/network-simulator.php#L156
22:59  NoiseEee: kov: on one server, you are requesting that warnings be reported.  on the other, your are not.
23:00  Evil_Otto: make your error_reporting setting the same as on the servers it 'works' on and i bet you get the same results
23:00  kov: NoiseEee, I understand that
23:00  hmd: Deltachaos, you know, I gave $30 bucks to the imagic author for a Windows version of the extension (and many did) for a Visual Studio license, we later learned he got a free copy on a conference, but didn't return the money, AND today there's still no Windows version. Hope that says enough.
23:00  NoiseEee: kov: okay, and now your question is?
23:00  kov: NoiseEee, notice I did not say the other server does not report the warning, I'm saying the test passes
23:00  NoiseEee: what test?
23:01  Evil_Otto: error reporting will affect the outcome of the test
23:01  kov: NoiseEee, the webkit test that uses this php code
23:01  Evil_Otto: now try the error_reporting setting
23:01  kov: Evil_Otto, it would, if the error was being reported to the test results, yeah =)
23:01  Deltachaos: hmd: hmm but a friend of my work on windows and use the imagic class as well? haw can it be? :D
23:01  Evil_Otto: obv it is
23:02  Evil_Otto: just try the setting
23:02  kov: Evil_Otto, sorry, but it's not
23:02  Evil_Otto: and if it doesn't work, then let us know
23:02  kov: this is a webkit test, the warning is only going to the apache log
23:03  NoiseEee: ...
23:03  kov: but anyway, thanks for your attention, I'll try to figure it out
23:04  hmd: Deltachaos, hmm, Windows builds were made available on Sep 19.
23:04  hmd: Deltachaos, there was a period of over an year where no Windows builds were available and I stopped bothering.
23:05  hmd: Deltachaos, I'll check, thanks for the heads up.
