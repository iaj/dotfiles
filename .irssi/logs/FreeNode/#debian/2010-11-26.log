00:01  noir_lord: The network manage applet under gnome is saying "no network connection" despite me having a working ethernet connection (I'm on it now) not a big issue except evolution won't go online since it thinks I'm offline
00:02  noir_lord: anyone else run into this? (debian squeeze - fully updated)
00:06  tharkun: noir_lord: yes ran into that as soon as i updated from lenny. I ditched network-manager
00:07  noir_lord: currently my thinking, it sucked under ubuntu and it sucks under debian, more automagic failure :|
00:09  noir_lord: it must be because this box has two eth interfaces my other machines are all fine, it's a good job machines with *two* interfaces are rare </sarcasm>
00:14  noir_lord: tharkun, good call, /etc/init.d/network-manager stop pretty much fixed it :|, damn I hate that program it is nothing but hassle
00:19  poisonbit: noir_lord, what is hassle for ones, is not for others, and vicebersa. I hate when there are not alternatives.
00:21  lolufail: hi!
00:21  noir_lord: poisonbit, I can see what you are saying but network-manager is bad, the issue I just ran into was filed as a bug in 2008 :|
00:21  lolufail: on a debian lenny, between 2 kvm lennys, any filetransfer is extremely slow, "cpu stuck for 61s" vith virtio, e1000 and rtl8139 are just super slow (10kb/s)... any ideas?
00:22  poisonbit: noir_lord, i'm about more than 10 years using the same lines/format in /etc/network/interfaces and try to avoid shapes like network-manager :)
00:23  noir_lord: poisonbit, I'm a refugee from slackware land so I can do the same if required which is nice if you can but it still sucks :)
00:23  poisonbit: noir_lord, if you don't connect to unknown networks, but has 2 or 3, you can use simply mappings  (zmore /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz for examples)
00:25  ike: zless is zmore!
00:25  ike: (sorry - couldn't resist)
00:25  noir_lord: poisonbit, thanks, I know you can do that and I have done that, my point was that nm fails in a simple use case, it's not user friendly and something like networking should be rock solid particulary when these issues crop up on every new release
00:26  noir_lord: also the message "no network connection" from the network manager while you are currently using a network connection to google how to disable the network manager is ironic :)
00:27  poisonbit: noir_lord, whats DDs use to say is "if something bugs you, use the bug tracker"
00:28  noir_lord: still that is the only issue I've had so far with debian squeeze which compared to 10.04 is a massive improvement, fully loving squeeze
00:29  noir_lord: having used it for a couple of weeks I'm still trying to figure out where ubuntu is adding value, debian squeeze feels like 10.04 except stable
00:29  poisonbit: ike, I was going to say that less is not in minimall install, but curiously:  LANG=C aptitude show $(dpkg -S /bin/zless | cut -d':' -f1) | grep Prio    # Priority: required
00:29  emerson_: hi everyone ..
00:30  poisonbit: gzip suggest less
00:30  poisonbit: hi emerson_
00:30  emerson_: I'm using gnu pascal and I have a problem, which is: I can't compile and make  the exe.
00:30  poisonbit: apt-get install build-essential ?
00:31  poisonbit: i've not used pascal in all my life, sorry, i shut up and continue what i was doing
00:31  poisonbit: "the exe" ?
00:32  noir_lord: emerson_, out of curiosity why are you using GNU Pascal, I found free pascal to be vastly superior if you've not had a look it might be worth while
00:32  emerson_: poisonbit: it's okay man don't worry ..thanks anyway ...
00:32  noir_lord: http://www.freepascal.org/
00:33 * tharkun once used Borland pascal
00:33  abrotman: yay turbo pascal ..
00:33  noir_lord: used Turbo Pascal then Delphi 3 through 6 and has used free pascal though not for a few years
00:33  emerson_: noir_lord: I have it installed already...
00:34  emerson_: noir_lord: so how do I installed it ?
00:34  noir_lord: emerson_, fair enough, if you get chance take a look at free pascal as a former pascal programmer it is *bar none* the best free pascal compiler (and works on a whole bunch of platforms and architectures pretty much seamlessly)
00:34  noir_lord: I think it is in the debian repo's as fpc
00:35  noir_lord: yeah it is, sudo aptitude install fpc
00:35  emerson_: noir_lord:  if you're a former pascal programmer we hava a lot to talk ...actually I have a lot to learn from you...let's say..
00:36  emerson_: noir_lord: I'm a freshman.....as you can see it ..
00:37  noir_lord: emerson_, not really the place for it however free pascal has an irc channel on here (freenode) #fpc
00:38  emerson_: poisonbit: sorry poisbit what did you say ..
00:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 897]
00:40  poisonbit: emerson_, I readed "I can't compile and make" and i thinked in the package "build-essentials" that provides "make", C compiler, etc,
00:40  poisonbit: emerson_, as said, I do not know pascal.... is it used by someone to solve daily production issues ?
00:42  poisonbit: emerson_, define "I can't compile and make the exe", are you about pascal syntax errors, or do you get other error messages ?
00:42  emerson_: poisonbit:right I think you missunderstood me ..:) is alreay up and running the gpc but I can't used..the problem isn't the gpc...is me :)
00:44  emerson_: poisonbit: right I can't give you my pastbin ... and you can't see it ..I gonna stop to talk about this here otherwiser people is gonna get angy here ..because isn't the right place for  that ...
00:48  poisonbit: ok, lets talk about debian... why there are too many `basename $0` (/usr/bin/basename "a; $(ls)" )   instead of  prog="${0##*/}"      (?)
00:49  poisonbit: what is the biggest point of entry of bugs in debian ? are there number about that ?
00:49  abrotman: point of entry?
00:49  poisonbit: maybe spanglish.... "origin"
00:50  abrotman: yes .. elaborate
00:50  k-man: if i am using lvm, is it safe to rmove libdevmapper?
00:50  emerson_: poisonbit: perhaps who knows ...lol...
00:51  poisonbit: abrotman, I mean something like... "upstream" N % of bugs, "mantainer scripts" N % of bugs
00:51  abrotman: poisonbit: i'm not aware of any stats on that
00:51  poisonbit: k-man,  aptitude why libdevmapper
00:52  k-man: poisonbit: lvm2 depends on it
00:52  k-man: poisonbit: but that command is cool, i never knew you could do that
00:52  poisonbit: then you do not want to remove it
00:52  emerson_: noir_lord: man the channel is dead...I mean the one that you told me ..nobody answer ...
00:53  noir_lord: emerson_, it's a small team there often is no one in there (considering the size of the team what they do is pretty cool)
00:53  noir_lord: emerson_, http://www.freepascal.org/docs.var is pretty much all you need to get up and going
00:53  k-man: poisonbit: yeah, i realised that, thanks :)
00:54  poisonbit: n.p.
00:56  poisonbit: why debian does not have an internal shell library functions like gentoo ?
00:57  poisonbit: couldn't be nice for mantainer scripts ?
00:58  abrotman: why does it need it ?
00:58  poisonbit: why don't ?
00:58  emerson_: noir_lord: right but, can I install it straight from my terminal ...would me much easier ..
00:59  mjmt: poisonbit: I think you'll find Gentoo needs that kind of thing because emerge scripts are sh.
01:00  poisonbit: mjmt, what are usually mantainer scripts but sh ?
01:00  poisonbit: more and more python, but you know
01:01  poisonbit: there is nothing in one line of shell that 6 linex of python can't do
01:03  kj4: does the book 'debian system' still apply to the current testing/stable releases.  The book is 5 years old
01:03  franki^: I think the point is that it's possible to read 6 lines of Python. ;)
01:03  kj4: i heard there was a newer version coming out, should I wait?
01:05  poisonbit: franki^, it's posible to _understand_ 6 lines of python, if (and only if) you know python, the same for one line of shell  (where shell is something more than piping useless uses of)  :)
01:07  poisonbit: I think that a lib, following best practices and wikis in the #bash /topic, couldn't does any hurt to debian and to pythoners unqupting shell
01:07  poisonbit: imho

01:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 886]
01:09  poisonbit: lot ot 20 years ago shell code, that is in any default debian, does not follow currently known best practices
01:09  abrotman: kj4: probably the general principles would still apply ..
01:10  themill: poisonbit: relying on python being installed and working for the maintainer scripts would be quite icky. Your assumption that there aren't libraries made use of in the maintainer scripts is quite wrong, however.
01:10  abrotman: themill: i think he meant having a central library
01:11  poisonbit: themill, maybe my ignorance about debian packaging, sure
01:11  poisonbit: if there are libs, I do not know them as user/sysadmin
01:11  themill: abrotman: there essentially is through debhelper and debconf for most of the stuff that could be abstracted sensibly.
01:11  abrotman: themill: i'm aware of those .. i assume he meant you know .. othe rstuff :)
01:12  jeeves_moss: is there a way to do fuzzy logic comparisions with imagmagick (or any other CLI program) of ~65Gb of pics to come up with dupes?
01:13  poisonbit: i've used debconf-set-selections to preseed options in packages
01:13  poisonbit: but that does not change old "codign" practices like progname=`basename $0`in my os
01:14  poisonbit: jeeves_moss, define  "logic comparisions"
01:14  themill: poisonbit: there's nothing wrong with that in a maintainer script or an init script.
01:14  mjmt: poisonbit: What do you think is wrong with that?
01:14  poisonbit: it can be done better
01:15  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, I have a huge image database (picture gallary board), and I need to be able to sort through (not manually though), and find images that are the same.  the only problem is that the images can/will be of diff sizes, file names, compression, etc.
01:15  poisonbit: and also, if there is something wrong in a future, with a lib it's easyer to fix all packages
01:16  amphi: jeeves_moss: the only thing I've done that with is gqview, which is not CLI
01:16  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, ideally, I'd like to be able to do "levels" of comparision, so I can use my CPU cycles better.
01:16  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, and then sore the hashes in a MySQL database so when I'm importing new images, I can hash them and compare them to the database and not hammer @ the disks
01:17  poisonbit: jeeves_moss, apt-cache search gives me:  findimagedupes - Finds visually similar or duplicate images
01:17  poisonbit: i don't know if will serve to you
01:18  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, dosn't work well with HUGE image sets.  it'll grind the disk, CPU, and RAM into the ground.  hence why I asked if there was a way to multilevel hash images, then use a fuzzy logic compare with hashes from a databse (I've got an insanely fast DB server)
01:19  poisonbit: I have photos dir most chaotic of all the channel, sorry, I'm not your man
01:20  poisonbit: with perl you can read exif, have more files open than filedescriptors available, etc...
01:20  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, thanks.  I'll figure it eventually.  I can't be that hard.  I just havn't found the right soulition yet
01:26  poisonbit: jeeves_moss, I don't knwo how many ram can take the hashs of 65GB of +/- 3 or 5 MB .... files, but storing/consulting hashed data should fly with memcached
01:29  jeeves_moss: poisonbit, memcached?  how would that help?
01:30  poisonbit: mysql needs too many tunning to go to serious numbers
01:30  poisonbit: with memcached you just need ram to get serious numbers
01:30  poisonbit: or more "nodes" (apt-get install memcached, not fucking mysql NDB clusters, heartbeat fuckups, etc)

02:25  JairunCaloth: hrm... from first glance at fdupes, it looks like this would be a good thing to script
02:25  JairunCaloth: it looks like it seperates groups of dupes by a newline
02:25  JairunCaloth: so you'll have to look for that to let you know you're on a newline
02:25  JairunCaloth: or a new file rather
02:26  JairunCaloth: ignore the first one, and run mv on the rest of the group

But, well, you can't do that without internet access :) Is there a way to download those packages and all their dependencies and burn them on cd?
10:53  homie: Pinchiukas: that depends totally on your needs
10:53  Pinchiukas: Which needs?
10:55 --- liable__ is now known as liable_
10:55  homie: Pinchiukas: like if you will move partitions or data around later....
10:55  Grega: I do know about packages.debian.org, but its a never-ending list of dependencies, do I really need to download one by one?
10:56  homie: Pinchiukas: it's normally not required to partition, one partition suffices normally and is the default for non-experienced ones
10:56  Pinchiukas: Well I'm setting up a webserver. Where could I get benefits from multiple partitions?
10:56  homie: Pinchiukas: however, say you have two disks, and would want to use the second one as say for something specific like /usr or /var or /home, then you can do that too
10:57  Pinchiukas: I have a single disk.
10:58  homie: Pinchiukas: security wise it could be matter, but otherwise it's even better its on one disk, since you won't have issues with disks of different speeds and such
10:58  homie: -be
10:59  homie: Pinchiukas: otherwise it's totally unrelevant where you put your server files, it will be mostly /srv or so, it does not have to be on a different disk
10:59  rdw200169: I have a rather silly question: I am trying to package a precompiled binary for multiple architectures.  I have a working package; but, to build it for multiple architectures using dpkg-deb, i have to manage separate control files! is there a better/easier way to do this?
10:59  homie: or partiton, just have proper security settings and
11:00  homie: maybe a jail around that
11:01  homie: Pinchiukas: for server things you do conentrate more on proper secure server config's and such
11:02 --- fyndat is now known as josep_
11:02  Pinchiukas: I'm thinking about using LVM for the server to make snapshot backups of the filesystem.
11:03  Pinchiukas: Any suggestions on documentation? :)
11:04  Hohi: when I have a 'interfaces="ipsec0=eth1 ipsec2=eth1:2"' I get an 'Cannot find device "ipsec2"' error.
11:04  Hohi: If I change ipsec2 to ipsec1 everything works fine
11:04  Hohi: Where is the knob to configure the amount of ipsec-Devices?
11:04  iaj: lo there.
11:06  iaj: I got a question - even tho this might be kind of off but I don't quite know on where else to ask.. I need to upgrade the system memory of a machine - so I opened up the machine and tried to find out, which motherboards inside.. but I only know its coming from dell - there are 6 DIMM slots, with the first 2 of them used with 1GB 400Mhz 2.5ns DDR modules (according to lshw) - anyone know what a safe way of upgrading would be ? and its maximum?
11:07  jelly: iaj: find out the model number (lshw, dmidecode), then look up its specs and/or manual on Dell's site

11:09  Testa: i have a indesting squezeee problem
11:09  ggggbabybabybaby: Pinchiukas: You can make snapshots with LVM? I thought that was to enable flexibility in filesystem layout.
11:10  ggggbabybabybaby: iaj, there are a lot of smart people in #hardware (or maybe ##hardware)
11:10  iaj: jelly: thanks so far - modelnumber of what?
11:11  potoew: Hello, using lshw I see this UNCLAIMED on serial Smbus, product: 82801I (ICH9 Family) SMBus Controller  what I need to install to get correct driver?
11:11  jelly: iaj: the machine itself
11:12  Alver: Hello. If I add ipv6 details to my eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces, I can no longer properly stop (and thus restart) /etc/init.d/networking; eth0 will stay up until I manually put it down using ifconfig.
11:13  jelly: iaj: it's right at the beginning of lshw output for me
11:13  iaj: jelly: hmm.. i guess it was a custom =built-together= machine.
11:13  homie: potoew: you need a usb driver but don't know which one exactly, what device is connected there ? a scanner ?
11:14  homie: potoew: a printer ?
11:14  Pinchiukas: ggggbabybabybaby: huh?
11:14  homie: potoew: or a usb video device ?
11:14  potoew: looks like a usual device, but I had not connected anything now.
11:14  potoew: thanks, I will see
11:15  homie: so either you need a usbcamera,scanner,printer or such driver
11:16  Testa: apt-get autoremove always removes the my fonts
11:16  homie: normally not printer i think
11:20  CutMeOwnThroat: !tell Testa about unmarkauto

11:27  cmyers: I have an EC2 node which is all F'd up due to startup scripts having circular dependencies so the initscripts package cant' be configured.  what is the magic to make it ignore that error and install other packages?  It's just an ec2 node I'm gonna throw away soon, but I need to install debootstrap, for example, to get something done.
11:28  Testa: does not bother me
11:28  CutMeOwnThroat: lashing! I even said "please"! Cause it's the day after Thanksgiving and everything
11:28  cmyers: (running squeeze, seemed to get messed up when I did a dist-upgrade)
11:29  CutMeOwnThroat: what is the error you get?
11:30  CutMeOwnThroat: Testa, and I don't understand what you say
11:30  cmyers: dpkg: error processing initscripts (--configure):
11:30  dpkg: cmyers: That isn't an error, post the whole output to a pastebin (/msg dpkg pastebin).
11:30  cmyers: yeh, it's long, guess I gotta pastebin =/
11:31  CutMeOwnThroat: looks like postinst/postrm
11:31  cmyers: postinst, yeh.
11:31  CutMeOwnThroat: but can't hurt to paste it before I tell you about it
11:31  CutMeOwnThroat: pastebin it*
11:31  ethanol: mornin' irc people
11:32  cmyers: http://pastebin.com/Vxcc9Jhg
11:32  cmyers: isn't all of it, but most of it.  the AMI has a bunch of weird ec2-* init scripts, looks like, which are screwing up the dependencies for the dep-based init script stuff.
11:33  CutMeOwnThroat: and you got that on apt-get remove insserv?
11:34  CutMeOwnThroat: and are your init.d softlinks all messed up now due to this or not yet?
11:34  cmyers: I get that on apt-get install now, it is blocking me doing anything
11:35  CutMeOwnThroat: !tell cmyers about postrm
11:35  cmyers: it first happened when I tried to dist-upgrade from squeeze to newer squeeze
11:35  CutMeOwnThroat: the way to deal with it is to fix the script... there are by design no force options...
11:35  cmyers: CutMeOwnThroat: ls /etc/init.d/ shows files, no symlinks.  is that what you mean?
11:35  Testa: CutMeOwnThroat 10 minut i show in a video
11:36  zealiod: how can i adpat this apache rule so that rewrites are not done where an alias exists, rather than a file...
11:36  zealiod: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f [NC]
11:36  CutMeOwnThroat: the one here in the error is not a postrm, but postinst, though... but goes for the same path...
11:36  cmyers: CutMeOwnThroat: thanks - I'll try bypassing the file to unblock myself.
11:37  alkisg: Is there a "how to" for sharing a scanner to the local network with Squeeze? The Ubuntu instructions I found don't work...
11:37  Testa: or txt
11:38  cmyers: CutMeOwnThroat: bam, that did hte trick.  my init scripts are prolly F'd on the box, but I don't plan to care pretty soon =)
11:38  CutMeOwnThroat: you can just null it or put exit(0) in the first line.... of course that means that it's not doing its stuff which can be cause more problems... cmyers - probably you want to look on the error you get when you try to remove it.. and do that with the postrm
11:39  CutMeOwnThroat: don't keep the package around if it can't deal with current dependencies
11:39  iglu: i'm thinking of putting in an ita for the orphaned pekwm-themes package. the themes were originally packaged from adrinux.wordpress.com, which no longer exists. would i be able to include new themes in addition to those already in the sources?
11:42  alkisg: Ah. There's probably some problem with the default device/group permissions for network scanning in Squeeze, because when I ran saned as root (instead of the default saned user), it worked fine.
11:42  CutMeOwnThroat: iglu, I don't think you're supposed to mix stuff from different projects in one package
11:42  alkisg: "io/hpmud/musb.c 137: unable get_string_descriptor -1: Operation not permitted" etc etc in daemon.log
11:44  CutMeOwnThroat: you started saned with your user?
11:44  CutMeOwnThroat: did you read /usr/share/doc/sane-utils/README.Debian?
11:45  alkisg: CutMeOwnThroat: I started saned with "invoke-rc.d saned start"
11:45  alkisg: No, I read the man page, reading the README now...
11:46  alkisg: CutMeOwnThroat: thank you. /me notes down to read the README files and not only the man pages in the future :)
11:46  alkisg: "By default the saned user is NOT part of the scanner group. If you add the saned user to the scanner group, ALL scanners will be made available over the network without restrictions."
11:47  iglu: it's just there's no upstream, and the package description is nothing specific to adrinux.wordpress.com
11:48  CutMeOwnThroat: Testa, just pastebin stuff for everyone... I did it this time http://pastebin.com/Epu8THd0 - and the solution is pretty clear from the factoid... you run aptitude unmarkauto sun-java6-fonts
11:50  iglu: and is only orphaned because the previous maintainer has left debian
11:50  alkisg: So in the end the proper thing to do for setting up a network scanner on Debian is just: `dpkg-reconfigure sane-utils` :)
11:50  CutMeOwnThroat: alkisg, they're for different things... the README.Debian often contains debian-specific stuff about setting things up or problems that occur in combination with other packages - always a good idea to give it a good glance when a package doesn't automatically work as one thoughht it would

11:53  Testa: thnx
11:53  SingAlong: anyone?
11:53  Testa: its work
11:53  CutMeOwnThroat: SingAlong, if you install "usbmount" it'll automatically mount it for you if it has a filesystem on it which it is configured to
11:53  CutMeOwnThroat: SingAlong, I can't even type a long answer within 1 minute! A little bit more patience wouldn't be bad
11:54  SingAlong: CutMeOwnThroat: sorry!
11:54  CutMeOwnThroat: well, acctually I type fast, but I think slow
11:54  SingAlong: how do i access the drive after i have usbmount?
11:54  CutMeOwnThroat: just cd into it... usbmount mounts stuff under /media/usb*
11:55  JKL_: i woul like to setup service where user takes ssh connection as user gw. then ssh server should be able to authenticate user against 2. username and some password. after authentication connection should close just after when some command is exceuted with given 2nd username. any ideas?

12:06  StucKman: I have a daemon that has to be launched at boot time. I have a init.d script for that, but now I have to change it slightly. this daemon might finish with an error code of 5, which means that we need to re run it. so I made a script that handles that, but now the init.d script doesn't work properly. I use start-stop-daemon, and because of this intermediate script, it doesn't corretly detect when the daemon has started properly. I tried playing with ...
12:06  StucKman: ... the --exec and --startas parameters, but no cigar. here's the intermediate script: http://pastebin.lugmen.org.ar/6355 and here's the function in the init.d script that starts the daemon: http://pastebin.lugmen.org.ar/6356 . DAEMON points to that intermediate scriot. now, how can I make start-stop-daemon detect correctly the runnig daemon? or should I get rid of it?
12:06  CutMeOwnThroat: but there's a #debian-kde ... on irc.debian.net, I think
12:07  StucKman: mu3en: what is it? I missed the question...
12:08  CutMeOwnThroat: why doesn't your init script itself just not try to restart  one more time when starting with start-stop-daemon fails.
12:08  mu3en: kde 4.4 squeeze systray hidden status not persistent.
12:09  StucKman: CutMeOwnThroat: because it can take some time for the daemon to return with errcode 5
12:09  StucKman: so I can't wait ini the init.d script for that
12:09  CutMeOwnThroat: mu3en, did you check the bts, btw?
12:09  eshat: mu3en: you can try asking in #debian-kde on irc.debian.net
12:09  CutMeOwnThroat: I said that!
12:09  StucKman: mu3en: you mean, that you hide the systray, but then it reapperas?
12:09  StucKman: reappears*
12:10  mu3en: no, i mean i hide the vlc icon, then quit vlc and when i start it again the icon is not hidden. same with other apps that are not per-se system tray 'native'.
12:11  StucKman: I see
12:11  StucKman: yeah, then you better check the bts and kde's bugzilla
12:11  StucKman: check in the plasma component
12:13  mu3en: right, good path, will do. thanks!

14:19  homie: at least when rebuilding
14:19  petern_: non-amd lib64?
14:19 * petern_ wonders how you get amd64 libs by accident :o
14:20  homie: i had lib64 in /usr then upgrading to testing got me the amd version somehow
14:20  homie: there's a amd64 version of libc6
14:22  ggggbabybabybaby: can I just 'mv /usr/* /'
14:22  ggggbabybabybaby: then symlink /usr to /
14:22  ggggbabybabybaby: because why have /usr/sbin when i have /sbin, etc etc

14:24  homie: yes, cause i got the multilib gcc i think

14:25  petern_: are you on a 32bit system?
14:26  homie: jep
14:26  petern_: interesting
14:26  homie: it's just the module not willing to work, i purged all stuff relating to fglrx, then reinstalled

15:06  randy_: StucKman, ye rpm,the rad hat use
15:06  StucKman: akio: depends on what you're using to configure the interfaces, but mostly it would mean to edit /etc/network/interfaces
15:06  StucKman: randy_: yes, I know what it is, I don't get how it relates to what you said
15:06  randy_: StucKman, I just deb will casue the same problem
15:06  akio: I didn't explain myself fully, and I think I am in the wrong channel.
15:07  randy_: StucKman, I try to said it in english
15:07  StucKman: randy_: you hadn't say what you're doing or what you're trying to do
15:08  randy_: StucKman, the relatoin problem,one day you install A package,it tell you should install B package,when install B.rpm it tell you should remove A package
15:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 910]
15:09  StucKman: randy_: sometimes it happens, yes, specially in debian unstable and sometimes in debian testing, but rarely in stable, and that's a bug
15:09  stew: a bug in unstable relating to rpms?
15:10  StucKman: stew: he's using rpm as a metaphor
15:10  StucKman: or example, actually
15:14  akio: Ok, I don't know if it is a live specific problem or not. But I am booting live Debian and I would like to stop Debian from dealing with my network cards.
15:15  StucKman: akio: hmm, I'm not sure it's possible
15:15  akio: I saw the boot parameter noload
15:16  akio: That looks like what I am looking for.
15:26  FalTam: hey
15:26  FalTam: what virus scanner should i use with postfix?
15:27  HackeMate: could debian run in an imac aluminium?
15:33  randy_: StucKman, but no way to avoid it?
15:35  g4tsu-ks: Hi
15:35  g4tsu-ks:  Is there an kernel version recommended for mouting an ocfs2 filesystem ?
15:44  StucKman: randy_: it normally happens when upgrading in the middle of a transition, which occurs from time to time in different parts of Debian. the way to avoid it is to realize this at upgrade time and refrain to upgrade, or realize this at install time and either wait till the conflict resolves (including reporting the bug) or try somehow to install older versions of the software. it you find such a thing in stable, you should/must report it as a bug.
15:45  randy_: StucKman, thank you
15:46  StucKman: randy_: my suggestion is that you install stable with backports, or at most, testing
15:48  Dekkzter: im installing rtorrent from source following a guide.... when running make prefix=$HOME install i get link: warning: library `/home/dekkzter/lib/libcurl.la' was moved error.. but the file is there... any idea?
15:48  djszapi: Do you publish the build logs anywhere ?

16:14  wrksx: hi all
16:15  wrksx:  I got sphinx runnin as a deamon and set up to use 256M of memory, what could happen if I ony got 1G available and then I start mysql with a innodb_buffer_pool_size set up to 800M ?
16:16  thewanderer1: wrksx: the OOM killer will go into play eventually :)
16:16  wrksx: shall I google OOM killer ?
16:16  wrksx: thewanderer1 ^
16:17  thewanderer1: works actually quite similar to putting your apps in Quake 3... frags the weakest :)
16:17  thewanderer1: do you have swap?
16:17  wrksx: a swap partition ?
16:17  thewanderer1: yes
16:17  rozie: well, oom killer is semi-random
16:17  wrksx: let me check I got no control on the partitions
16:18  thewanderer1: if your total address space is 1GB, expect apps being killed :P
16:18  thewanderer1: and you can google OOM killer...
16:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 909]
16:21  thewanderer1: the wisest thing to do is currently either disabling the OOM killer (if you control this kernel setting, /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory set to 2), making absolutely sure your programs won't eat all memory, or marking the proper apps as unkillable (see http://lwn.net/Articles/317814/ )
16:21  wrksx: thewanderer1, this is what could cause apps to crash, right ?
16:21  thewanderer1: not to crash, but to get killed
16:22  thewanderer1: I think they receive SIGTERM first...
16:22  wrksx: thewanderer1, ok
16:22  thewanderer1: but still, respective daemons will be terminated, yes
16:22  wrksx: thewanderer1, as long at it terminates gently =)
16:22  wrksx: thewanderer1, I'm ok with it
16:22  wrksx: thanks for the infos
16:23  skinder: may i make a translation of http://wiki.debian.org/BashScripting ? im unsure because it's a copy of someone's post
16:23  skinder: is there a w.d.o irc channel?
16:24  thewanderer1: skinder: currently, the works on wiki.debian.org are unlicensed afaik, that's why it's migrating to a new wiki, so you *should* contact the author first
16:25  thewanderer1: unless the article states a licence somewhere
16:26  skinder: hurrrr.
16:26  skinder: okay, thanks, thewanderer1
16:31  qwd: How do you see to which package a command belongs?
16:32  thewanderer1: qwd: if it's installed locally, then you call `dpkg --search $(which $command)` replacing $command with your command name
16:32  thewanderer1: otherwise try apt-file or visit packages.debian.org and search there
16:32  Mattador: hello
16:32  qwd: dpkg --search $(which $md5sum)
16:33  dpkg: qwd: i haven't a clue
16:33  qwd: "search needs at least one file name pattern argument"
16:33  Mattador: Any reason why .rar open in windows but when i try in linux it says corrupted? i made sure to download in binary mode..  used force and it still says fail
16:34  qwd: Mattador: Do you have the free version of unrar? I think that doesn't handle RAR3
16:34  skinder: i have the same problem
16:34  Mattador: qwd: yes i tried to use unrar, unrar-free
16:34  skinder: i use a windows machine for them :)
16:34  Mattador: for windows i have free version but still lets me open file with error messages
16:35  xyan: Mattador: try p7zip-rar
16:35  AimHere: Tell whoever's giving you these .rar files that he should switch to open file formats
16:35  AimHere: p7zip-rar is unfree too
16:35  themill: "giving"...
16:36  Mattador: hrm
16:36  Mattador: that or i can just get the cracked one from demonoid
16:36  Grega: What is the preferred way to install php5.3.3 on lenny?
16:36  Mattador: I just wanted to make sure that i wasnt doing something wrong.. ill keep downloading to my ftp and just use windows to open it
16:36  Mattador: main thing i wantd to do is store it.. and make sure it works dont wanna download GBS of data then the stuff is corrupted
16:37  thewanderer1: qwd: you replaced "command", not "$command" as I told you - it should be `dpkg --search $(which md5sum)`
16:37  qwd: thewanderer1: doh! thanks
16:38  thewanderer1: Grega: why would you need it, exactly?
16:38  Grega: I need php-fpm
16:39  thewanderer1: Grega: you should check backports and if no suitable version is available there, you can use uupdate to build the package from the current sources
16:42  Grega: I didnt find anything on backports, right now I'm looking at http://serverfault.com/questions/22414/how-can-i-run-debian-stable-but-install-some-packages-from-testing
16:42  thewanderer1: Grega: if you do that, you'll end up with a broken system...
16:42  thewanderer1: or at least *might* end up
16:43  Grega: ow, ok.. how about http://www.dotdeb.org/2010/07/25/php-5-3-3-packages-are-available/ ?
16:43  qq-: !dotdeb
16:43  dpkg: dotdeb is, like, for the latest PHP and MySQL releases, packaged up and backported for your pleasure, go to http://dotdeb.org/, but realize that we cannot support dotdeb packages here, so you will be ON YOUR OWN.  There is little reason to use dotdeb.org now that backported versions of PHP and MySQL are available from backports.debian.org.  Ask me about <backports> and <debian-backports>.  "aptitude purge ~Vdotdeb"
16:45  thewanderer1: qq-: I don't think that backports currently has any versions of PHP - is the factoid outdated?
16:46  Grega: Yes, there is no php, so I guess I'll have to use dotdeb
16:46  thewanderer1: or build your own :P
16:47  mbruins: hi, what is the "right" way to add a user to my lenny system and also give him access to ssh?
16:47  mbruins: i looked in /etc/ssh/sshd_config but couldnt find a parameters there
16:48  jelly: mbruins: adduser command.
16:48  mbruins: im quessing i should adduser the user first
16:48  mbruins: and then perhaps add the user in a config file of sshd?
16:48  mbruins: am i in the right direction?
16:48  jelly: access via ssh service is available by default, mbruins
16:48  mbruins: allright, so ill just have to adduser a new user
16:48  jelly: right
16:48  mbruins: thanks alot quess i was thinking to much
16:48  mbruins: :)

17:09  dpkg: [lt] Lithuania
17:09  Worms: i will to explaine you my problem
17:09  hid3: yeah, I know dpkg...
17:10  Worms: i've a server (under debian) and, this last mounth was hacked for Scaning
17:10  Worms: i've read all log
17:10  Worms: and i see nothing
17:10  bolt-work: hacked for Scaning?
17:10  hid3: reinstall
17:10  hid3: clean install
17:11  bolt-work: hid3: no point in that, unless you know what vulnerability caused the intrusion
17:11  Worms: my server was hacked, and the hacker use my serfer for scan
17:11  hid3: but before that to dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ice to wipe everything from there
17:11  hid3: bolt-work: any hacked system should be reinstalled
17:11  bolt-work: Worms: how was the server hacked? what does it run?
17:11  bolt-work: hid3: there might be critical information regarding the intrusion on that system. wiping it and reinstalling the same software will just lead to another hack
17:11  at0m: hid3: might be nice to dd to file first for inspection =]
17:12  Worms: Postfix (and other tools with postfix), TS3, TS2, Apache3
17:12  Worms: Apache2*
17:12  Worms: PSYBNC
17:12  hid3: at0m, bolt-work: yeah, you're right, but finally , in conclusion the same system should never be run in production again
17:12  hid3: check psybnc
17:13  bolt-work: hid3: that is, of course, true, but wiping the system at this point would still be a bad idea, i think
17:15  hid3: that was probably how the hacker got interested in your system ;-)
17:15  hid3: did I mention 'at this point'? ;-)
17:15  bolt-work: hid3: well, you told him to reinstall, without any mention of a time to do it. that generally means "now" in my book
17:15  Worms: i wouldn't reinstall if possible
17:15  hid3: Worms: it's your system and your choice, of course, but I will mention again: if it were my system, I would never run it in production. In any case. Just my 2 cents here.
17:16  hid3: So anyone had any success with Nokia CA-42 cable and a phone? I want to set up a SMS notification system...
17:16  tharkun: Worms: If you system was hacked i strongly suggest that you do an image of the hdd for later forensic analysys. Revoke all users from access to a shell on the systema and reinstall the OS as soon as possible.
17:17  hid3: x2 !
