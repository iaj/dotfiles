00:01  amphi: chicognu: why are you trying to build the intel driver?
00:02  chicognu: amphi, cuz my driver is not support by lenny
00:03  amphi: chicognu: what makes you think that version of the driver will work with your version of X and so on?
00:03  chicognu: amphi, nothing
00:03  chicognu: amphi, but if needed I compile the entire X
00:04  amphi: chicognu: you might be better off to update to squeeze, perhaps, if you have hw that's too new for lenny
00:04  amphi: chicognu: have you compiled the entire X before?
00:05  chicognu: amphi, you are the 293849384 person, only today, to tell me that is better install squeeze
00:05  amee2k: mmmh, this sucks. 4.0 netinst freezes :(
00:05  amphi: *shrug*
00:05  chicognu: amphi, never, no ideia if it is dificult or just some ./configure make make install
00:05  robokop: chicognu: that probably has a reason don't you think
00:06  chicognu: robokop, no
00:06  amphi: chicognu: it will be an educational experience, in any case
00:06  amphi: good luck
00:06  robokop: educational and tiresome
00:07  chicognu: robokop, ways has a reason, of course, but not a always a good reason ?
00:07  amphi: but such fun to maintain ;)
00:07  neil_d: on my SBC I have mdadm running... it starts up the daemon at S25.. but it doesn't run the auto-assemble script :( ... when should this be done ?  S26 ?
00:08  robokop: for me it stops at building my own kernel
00:08  amphi: chicognu: are you going to remove the X that is in lenny before doing this?
00:08  chicognu: amphi, do you think that driver will not work with my atual Xorg version ?
00:08  chicognu: amphi, no ideia
00:09  amphi: chicognu: does it not say what its requirements are on the intel site?
00:09  amphi: chicognu: it should say that it needs xorg version >= foo
00:10  robokop: dpkg: xorg
00:10  amphi: chicognu: BTW, why have you rejected the idea of upgrading to squeeze?
00:10  dpkg: X.Org X11, the reference implementation of the X Window System, forked from XFree86 4.4RC2.  The current release is X11R7.5.  To install, ask me about <install x>.  Ask me about <drxx> to reconfigure.  To remove, ask about <remove x>.  http://wiki.debian.org/Xorg  http://www.x.org/wiki/FAQ  #xorg on irc.freenode.net.

00:11  robokop: blegh, what was the trigger for seeing versions of packages
00:11  amphi: judd: versions xorg
00:11  judd: Package xorg on i386 -- etch: 1:7.1.0-19; lenny: 1:7.3+20; squeeze: 1:7.5+7; sid: 1:7.5+8; experimental: 1:7.6~2

00:12  chicognu: amphi, I just download the six packs dvds, if I need to download anyother version of debian, for sure I will use ubuntu, and not debian
00:12  robokop: why have you downloaded 6 dvds
00:12  amphi: chicognu: why not just use the netinstall iso, which is ~130MB if I recall correctly
00:12  amphi: ?
00:13  amphi: no wonder the damn tubes are clogged
00:13  chicognu: again, you are the 928392 person today to say that
00:13  robokop: and you can upgrade from lenny to squeeze without reinstalling
00:13 --- zz_Crisco is now known as Crisco
00:13  chicognu: serious ? that is a new to me (no it is not)
00:13  chicognu: :P
00:14  amphi: chicognu: ok, enjoy
00:14  robokop: chicognu: the more i hear you talk the more i am convinced that compiling your own drivers isn't a viable option for you
00:14  robokop: chicognu: i don't say this to be harsh, but to warn you
00:17  chicognu: robokop, why do you think that compile a driver will be dificult ?
00:18  yagoo: chicognu, because you're already lost before knowing how to compile/debug/install it. Compiling it is not a straightforward process.
00:18  robokop: the entire X stack is quite complicated and a lot can go wrong along the way, and i get the feeling you aren't very experienced in compiling your own software
00:19  chicognu: robokop, and you think it is not a viable option to me just because I hate net install, and think that apt-get some times sux a lot, and it is not a trusted way to upgrade between versions ?
00:20  yagoo: chicognu, it's not only robokop that thinks compiling is not a viable option for you..  but seeing you say you download 6 debian dvd's tells enough to me.
00:21  robokop: you show a lot of ignorance, so that leads me to believe that you wouldn't be able to pull the trick without a lot of handholding
00:21  chicognu: yagoo, that opinion makes me laugh
00:21  chicognu: out load
00:21  yagoo: <chicognu> amphi, I just download the six packs dvds, if I need to download anyother version of debian, for sure I will use ubuntu, and not debian
00:21  yagoo: " "
00:21 * yagoo -_- doesn't like that
00:22  robokop: and we already told you about a good alternative and we are here doing this for free so perhaps we are not looking forward to hold your hand in the compile progress
00:22  yagoo: good way not to get any help in here. I won't with that kind of rudeness.
00:22  amphi: chicognu: why are you talking in here, instead of building the driver, if you have nothing but contempt for what people here tell you?
00:23  amphi: robokop: such hand-holding would be off-topic, so don't worry ;)
00:26  chicognu: amphi, Who told you I don`t care for what persons tell to me ? I care, and ALOT, and I`m glad and thak full that some people helps me, in special in this morning, but I think some ideas just not quite smart. Like use apt-get to upgrade a distro, or that some one should only download the first Cd or the first dvd. In my case I strong need at least the first, second, and six (update) dvd
00:26  chicognu: and in time
00:27  karsten-nr: Anyone else seeing KDE apps not have functioning menu bars?  I'm using kontact in WindowMaker.  Menus periodically refuse to work.
00:28  amphi: chicognu: ok, you know best
00:28  robokop: /ignore chicognu
00:28  yagoo: amphi, notcha
00:28  yagoo: I got get me some donuts and take out the garbage
00:28  amphi: yagoo: eh?
00:28  karsten-nr: And that's under testing/squeeze.
00:28  abrotman: chicognu: you are wrong
00:29  chicognu: robokop, before use debian, I use gentoo and slackware, and if there is a thing that I don`t know about it is to apt stuff... If i`am not success in compile the module it will because a incompatibility between my atual X version and that special module
00:29  yagoo: amphi, Only the best have a best nose into themselves. They care more about what they care-say than care take.
00:29  yagoo: amphi, i share your point :)
00:29  amphi: ah
00:30  amphi: chicognu: if you are going to use debian, you should learn to use the package management tools
00:30  chicognu: abrotman, Im not man, you like debian and defend it, and apt-get can be a great in dependence manager, but some times it fail
00:31  abrotman: chicognu: how long have you been using Linux?
00:31  Xanbreon: if you try and build a brand new intel driver with the old xorg in lenny you will probs fail
00:31 * amphi misses mwilson
00:32  abrotman: amphi: Shut up, you have no idea what you're talking about, obviously the floppy drive was created to read CD-ROMs
00:32  karsten-nr: abrotman: I thought the floppy was created to read punch tape.
00:32  amphi: wtf does that have to do with it? apart from nothing, of course
00:32  Xanbreon: Would help if floppy drives read CD-ROMS, i have tons of working FDD's but only 1 iffy DVDROM drive :(
00:33  chicognu: abrotman, just to show a concret case. yesterday after download some updates, and install some programs apt-get return me `those packages are automated installed, and are no longer required use apt-get autoremove to remove them` ... I did so and gnome goes way ...
00:33  abrotman: karsten-nr: you moron, go read the docs!
00:33  abrotman: chicognu: then you did it wrong .. it wasn't the tool that failed, it was the user
00:33  karsten-nr: abrotman: I need to learn braille first.
00:33  chicognu: abrotman, how ??
00:33  Xanbreon: PBKC
00:34 * amphi gives Xanbreon some vowels
00:34 * Xanbreon looks at said vowels in puzzlement 
00:34  chicognu: If the tool say to I run apt-get autoremove because there is packages that are not need anymore, and I did it, and It removes gnome ?
00:34  amphi: gnome is never needed
00:34 * amphi hides
00:35  chicognu: abrotman, there is at least 6 years I use linux
00:35  Xanbreon: if it says there not needed, it means nothing depends on them..
00:35  Xanbreon: man apt-get or man aptitude
00:35 --- Crisco is now known as chat
00:35 --- chat is now known as Crisco
00:35  robokop: chicognu: what Xanbreon said and you didn't manually installed gnome but something that depends on gnome
00:36  chicognu: Xanbreon, yes, is it what it says, but when I execute apt-get autoremove it remove my gnome. WHY ?
00:36  Xanbreon: you probs broke the bloated (imo, ymmv) gnome meta packages
00:36  robokop: if you removed that then apt doesn't know you wanted gnome
00:36  Xanbreon: chicognu: Cos thats what you asked it todo!!!
00:36  chicognu: Xanbreon, sure, and WHY gnome are not more need ?
00:37  Xanbreon: Not needed == nothing depends on (and when something is auto installed, when nothing depends on it, it gets removed)
00:38  iluminator101: hey guys, does debian squeeze support btrfs?
00:39  roe: I'm trying to configure ldaps using OpenLDAP, I have added the following: http://pastebin.com/XUdc1CBE
00:39  roe: it seems that debian does things a bit differently than the standard package
00:39  yagoo: amphi, oh mwilson.. i remember that guy. hehehee.. I wish someone should just tell someone who never listens: "You are wrong.". hehehe
00:39  chicognu: there is any atheist here to I talk about Jesus, or so ? It will be more easy to convice they :)
00:40  Xanbreon: apt is doing what its supposed to, your just using it wrong >>
00:40  abrotman: chicognu: wrong channel, not funny
00:40  chicognu: abrotman, a lot funny
00:40  abrotman: chicognu: NOT FUNNY
00:40  iluminator101: hey guys, does debian squeeze support btrfs?
00:40  abrotman: chicognu: if you don't understand how your tool works, don't blame the tool .. go read the documentation
00:40  yagoo: abrotman, i took two breaks and the only thing i see coming from that guy is negativitty
00:41  abrotman: iluminator101: it seems to
00:41  iluminator101: is it in the installer, i dont have go back in to install a btrfs partition?
00:42  Xanbreon: support should be in the .32 kernel, not sure if everything else would support using it as the root or boot partition
00:42  abrotman: iluminator101: it's a module ..
00:42  yagoo: iluminator101, well btrfs is gpl licensed so likely it's usable
00:42  roe: if you're interested in using btrs I would probably stick with sid
00:42  abrotman: iluminator101: but the installer may not support it .. yet
00:42  abrotman: roe: sid has the same kernel .. nice try
00:42  roe: for the moment
00:43  abrotman: and still doesn't address the installer
00:43  Xanbreon: btrfs is a fast moving target so you would probs want a newer kernel
00:43  abrotman: you're still not addressing his issue ...
00:43  abrotman: way to go ... you said the same thing as the other guy that wasn't helpful
00:44  Xanbreon: errh
00:44  roe: oh, he's asking about the installer?
00:44  karsten-nr: So, sort of sorted my KDE menus issue.
00:44  karsten-nr: Dual-head, squeeze/testing.
00:44  chicognu: Ok, I`m sorry folks. apt-get  is a fail proof packager manager. I`m sorry to arguing about that, It solves all dependences of packages in official repository :) Amem
00:44  Xanbreon: Also: pretty sure everything else doesnt support using it as / or /boot yet
00:44  Xanbreon: !!
00:44  dpkg: I'm not your csh prompt!
00:44  karsten-nr: LVDS1 (onboard) and VGA1 displays, configured via xrandr.
00:44  Xanbreon: least not the versions in squeeze
00:45  karsten-nr: Application window menus do NOT appear for apps which are displayed on LVDS1 (laptop screen).  They first appear at top fo screen on VGA1, then within the app window.
00:45  abrotman: llimeht: you left me alone!
00:45  karsten-nr: This is prety reproduceable.
00:47  JyZyXEL: http://pastebin.com/hR4pD5Sx why doesn't this work on lenny?
00:47  JyZyXEL: the remove event doesn't trigger
00:47  amphi: karsten-nr: qt menus appear on the wrong monitor initially?
00:48  JyZyXEL: is it a known bug?
00:48  karsten-nr: amphi: No, not at all.

00:51  yagoo: JyZyXEL, weren't you jygzy?
00:52  he2: and i'm searchin' a nice lightwight file manager for xfce
00:52  he2: with tab-function
00:52  JyZyXEL: i can't find a bug report for it tho
00:53  Xanbreon: he2: try pcmanfm
00:53  dsirijus: um, setting /etc/default/locale LANG to a locale -a listed locale doesn't do anything even after reboot... all outs of locales still print either "POSIX" or nothing (for LANG and LC_ALL)
00:53  dsirijus: setting it through bashrc does do it, though
00:58  abrotman: he2: which WM/DE do you use?
00:58  robokop: abrotman: he said a file manager for xfce
00:58  abrotman: oh missed that second line
01:01  JyZyXEL: the only other option to detect removal is to use the ENV{} attributes of the device but their not individual enough
01:01  JyZyXEL: udev end up executing the RUN like 4 times in parallel
01:01  JyZyXEL: so even with lock file its impossible to prevent it from running more than once
01:02  JyZyXEL: are there any ways to detect and block such parallel execution of executable?
01:03  diegows_: hi, is there any documentation about preseeding a whole disk encrypted installation? an example may be?
01:03  karsten-nr: JyZyXEL: The general method is via a PIDfile or lockfile.  That's how SysVInit scripts do it.  See also monit.
01:04  JyZyXEL: lock files aren't fast enough
01:04  karsten-nr: JyZyXEL: What's the application?  And how fast does it have to be?
01:04  JyZyXEL: bash so its automatically slow as shit
01:05  jordanm: make a new file called local-changes.conf or something and add the blacklist to thaton.
01:05  JyZyXEL: i don't know how fast udev runs but its probably insanely fucking fast
01:05  karsten-nr: JyZyXEL: You're going to have to be a bit m ore specific than that.
01:06  karsten-nr: JyZyXEL: The way lockfile usage runs is:  you test for lockfile, you create lockfile via a method that fails if the lockfile exists (getting around race conditions).  Failure of either of these results in failure to launch.  You then launch process.  Clean up later.
01:07  JyZyXEL: yea but implemented in bash thats not fast enough to detect if you run the script multiple times in parallel
01:07  mshadle: i have a package marked as "pi" for purge, but installed - how can i fix it so it is back to "ii" ? it's still installed, i tried to purge it but it failed because of a dependency.
01:07  mshadle: i cant reinstall it properly without somehow finding the .deb
01:08  karsten-nr: mshadle: Debian package or 3rd-party?
01:08  mshadle: standard repo packages
01:08  karsten-nr: mshadle: Should be in the package pool then
01:08  mshadle: how can i get the .deb file?
01:09  mshadle: apt-get source gets me the source stuff. not the deb
01:09  karsten-nr: mshadle: apt-get -d install <package>
01:10  karsten-nr: mshadle: You can directly ftp to your Debian package repo and browse teh pool for the version you have installed.
01:10  fishcooker: i've just install some debian package
01:10  he2: abrotman: xfce4
01:10  fishcooker: but i don't know the location of the binaries
01:10  mshadle: yeah... kinda dont want to manually dig for 4-5 different oens ;)
01:10  abrotman: he2: nevermind, i saw, you got a decent answer
01:10  mshadle: -d didn't work :/
01:10  karsten-nr: mshadle: Life's a bitch.
01:10  he2: abrotman: thanks, any way
01:11  karsten-nr: mshadle: You can specify a specific version as well in your aptitude line.
01:11  fishcooker: how to locat the binaries
01:11  mshadle: -d says it's already installed and updated/latest
01:11  karsten-nr: mshadle: man aptitude, search "To select a particular version of the package"
01:11  nsadmin: so if you get the source you can build yourself a package
01:12  karsten-nr: mshadle: aptitude install mypackage=<version>
01:12  heg: Moving with the mouse cursor over a link, button, menu option etc, it's executed automatically without clicking. How i can stop that?
01:12  karsten-nr: mshadle: eg: aptitude install apt=0.3.1
01:12  karsten-nr: mshadle: Force.  RTFM.
01:12  karsten-nr: mshadle: ... or reinstall.  I think that's what it wants.
01:13  mshadle: i'm trying to force. or reinstall. (i can't reinstall as it won't let me remove it first)
01:13  karsten-nr: mshadle: "aptitude reinstall mypackage=<version>" should do it.
01:13  karsten-nr: mshadle: If that fails, pastebin the errors.
01:13  mshadle: since it's only one line - trying reinstall - You can only specify a package version with an 'install' command or a 'forbid-version' command.
01:14  mshadle: just reinstall worked though.
01:14  mshadle: typically i use apt-get.. i guess i'll have to start messing with aptitude itself
01:14  CharminTheMoose: Hey all. I've got two X issues. I'm on debian testing atm and whenever I exit X, the screen still stays the same, but I appear to be at the CLI anyway, but unable to see it. Is this a driver problem or a Xorg problem? Thanks

06:02  tharkun: Is it possible to chainload sda1 grub to sdb1 grub and start booting there?
06:06  nsadmin: is sdb1 grub a chainload?
06:06  nsadmin: one way to find out:
06:07  nsadmin: boot sda1's grub, get to its grub prompt
06:07  tharkun: nsadmin: sdb1 is debian lenny sda1 is mandriva 2006 with grub installed
06:07  nsadmin: then try to chainload sdb1 from there
06:07  tharkun: nsadmin: no way to do that. i can make the server reboot and hope for the best
06:08  nsadmin: no way? not understanding that
06:08  nsadmin: why is there no way?
06:08  tharkun: I do not have phisical access to the server. At least not until this Saturday.
06:08  nsadmin: oh, this must be a remote?
06:08  nsadmin: ok
06:09  nsadmin: and there's no serial console functionality
06:09  tharkun: none
06:09  nsadmin: so the main reason is you can't get to any grub> prompt
06:09  tharkun: The server is stuck in a warehouse 2 hours away from my current location
06:09  nsadmin: can you wait until saturday?
06:10  nsadmin: when you say "stuck" does this imply you want it elsewhere soon?
06:10  tharkun: Well if i wait untill Saturday i will have a 2 hours of intense download and intense setting up of that server
06:11  tharkun: nsadmin: I want that server in my office to fix, clean and reconfigure. But i am not that lucky ;P
06:11  nsadmin: can you do the download in the meantime into a temp place on the server?
06:12  nsadmin: like aptitude -d install...
06:12  tharkun: nsadmin: well mandriva doesn't have aptitude install
06:12  nsadmin: so it's required the server be mandriva?
06:13  tharkun: no, the server is beeing moved from mandriva into debian. I got fed up of mandriva
06:13  nsadmin: oh ok
06:13  nsadmin: so, what is the download?
06:14  tharkun: nsadmin: well i wanted to
06:15  nsadmin: so presently, you want to be able to boot debian
06:15  terminator: How do you fix a problem with the depencies?
06:15  nsadmin: that's what I'm hearing most strongly
06:15  mordocai: terminator: Depends what the problem is, really.
06:16  terminator: Its a lot the depencies are messed up.
06:16  terminator: missing
06:16  nsadmin: tharkun: can you hold off on setting up the debian grub and boot debian directly from the mandriva grub?
06:17  tharkun: nsadmin: well i wanted to be able to chainload debian since it is on lvm and that particular server has no support for it.
06:17  terminator: I thought that it was dpkg or aptitude
06:17  nsadmin: so... the debian has lvm lvs and mandriva does not?
06:17  tharkun: yes
06:17  nsadmin: also mandriva does not have support for lvm, say, in the kernel?
06:18  tharkun: nsadmin: It is indeed an old server. I don't expect it to have support for LVM
06:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 785]

06:20  nsadmin: maybe postgres
06:20  tharkun: ´/boot is on a normal partition with 413 MB free
06:21  nsadmin: so you could get to its kernel
06:21  nsadmin: and boot it
06:21  tharkun: yes
06:21  nsadmin: and you can do that from the mandriva grub (potentially)
06:21  tharkun: yes
06:22  terminator: dtc-postfix-dovecot (= 0.32.5-1~gplbp50+1) but it is not going to be installed?
06:22  nsadmin: so... I would recommend trying to add a boot stanza in the mandriva grub
06:23  nsadmin: is this server production?
06:23  nsadmin: a copy of the actual production server?
06:23  nsadmin: something else?
06:23  tharkun: well i can hack overnight as long as i leave the production part up and running at 6:00 am
06:24  tharkun: and yes it is a production server with no 24/7 required services
06:24  nsadmin: my guess is you should copy it to another machine
06:25  nsadmin: make the other machine production, and leave it run
06:25  nsadmin: then take the other machine to the office
06:25  tharkun: nsadmin: if i had the extra machine i would have done that ;P
06:26  nsadmin: give your boss an incentive: "It will cost you $1/mile plus gas plus wear and tear plus total indemnification for anything that happens when I'm driving back and forth with the server"
06:26  nsadmin: "or, bring me the server"
06:27  terminator: Maybe debian should consider removing apt-get
06:27  simonrvn: o_O
06:27  Kaizen: no way
06:28  Kaizen: it sounds too cool
06:28  tharkun: nsadmin: I get a two hour window this Saturday to fix everything. Do or die. No excuses left to postpone it.
06:29  nsadmin: but is there a reason you're driving to do it
06:29  terminator: What does this mean ? Errors were encountered while processing: libapache2-mod-bwshare E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) Error code 1?
06:30  nsadmin: anyway, we've identified a few choices you have... but if you don't have a remote console, it's going to be a risk every time you reboot
06:30  nsadmin: howbout this:
06:31  nsadmin: get the mandriva to the point it can do xen or kvm
06:31  tharkun: The server began failing due to a bug in the mysql version it has. And there are a lot of other stuff that will be much better once upgraded
06:31  nsadmin: then run them both
06:31  nsadmin: you should fix the server fail separately
06:32  nsadmin: you can still do that remotely
06:32  nsadmin: anyway, good luck... gotta go
06:32  tharkun: nsadmin: thx for your time and thx for opening my mind to the several new options
06:33  nsadmin: probably that was the best I could do

07:10  EmleyMoor: I don't specify it at all
07:10  WormFood: jpinx-eeepc, the requirements for imagemagick are rather large (it wants to install 86 other packages)

07:11  EmleyMoor: Don't put the line at all
07:12  EmleyMoor: It assumes composite1 if you leave it out
07:12  WormFood: thanks EmleyMoor, that seemed to do the trick. I didn't think about deleting the lines, since they (man page) claimed they are the defaults

11:06  kotique: yeah, file list isn't low level, it's the basics
11:07  cryptr: kotique: there are several kde/gnome variants you could try out
11:07  kotique: because aptitude is for user package management and user want to see what files are going to be installed

11:10  Qtronix: cryptr: no problem. :)
11:11  blast_hardcheese: Qtronix: If I'm not mistaken, when you first install MySQL it prompts you for a default root password
11:11  blast_hardcheese: but you can reset it by connecting to the database as root, (also if I'm not mistaken)
11:11  Qtronix: blast_hardcheese: yeah, but i'm wondering for the password for debian-sys-maint :)
11:12  cryptr: Qtronix: check /etc/mysql/
11:12  blast_hardcheese: Oh, I'm sorry, I have no experience with that :<
11:12  cryptr: Qtronix: think it was a debian.cnf once in a lifetime
11:13  Qtronix: ah
11:13  Qtronix: thanks, i'll check that out
11:13  cryptr: Qtronix: aye tehre is, i just checked my webserver

11:15  blast_hardcheese: I could purge and reinstall again if you'd like, just tell me which files to make sure to delete
11:15  blast_hardcheese: like /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-core.conf or others
11:15  kotique: why is mark Auto is assigned to M ? it should be "a", not "M" which is naturally manual
11:15  kotique: !!CONSISTENCY!!
11:16  cryptr: kotique: makes you think doesn't?
11:16  kotique: wondering what happens to debian in 10 years
11:16  blast_hardcheese: kotique: You want to use one of the worst interfaces in package management instead of using the very useful and helpful command line arguments.
11:16  blast_hardcheese: I don't care.
11:17  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: do a sudo dmesg -c && sudo alsa reload && dmesg
11:17  kotique: ;-)
11:17  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: or as root without the sudo.
11:17  kotique: I mean, it's the destiny of slackware, definitely
11:17  kotique: with such attitude
11:17  kotique: with such aptitude
11:17  blast_hardcheese: heh
11:17  cryptr: kotique: go for dselect :)
11:17  blast_hardcheese: Don't tell him about that, he'll get more pissed that there are other tools

11:19  kotique: I know WHY debian has so many package mgmt tools, but I don't understand WHY the devs didn't change the situation. it's 2010.

11:31  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: mmm
11:32  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: desktop you say, perhaps you have installed the HDA AC97 jada jada stuff wrong? the connection that goes to the motherboard?
11:32  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: or perhaps it is but into wrong mode in the BIOS?
11:32  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: did you build it yourself or is it a HP/DELL desktop typ?
11:32  cryptr: type.

11:40  blast_hardcheese: I found that link and tried that suggestion :)
11:41  blast_hardcheese: If you look waaaaaaaay up when I first asked this question, I actually mentioned that I had already tried model=generic
11:41  blast_hardcheese: Sound is very quiet, mixer doesn't work, and I only get the right channel

11:44  blast_hardcheese: That's OK :)
11:44  cryptr: blast_hardcheese: but if you do get sound with that fix, then most likely you have the same bug and we are on the right path atleast
11:44  blast_hardcheese: That bug was from 2009 though, I would have expected it to be fixed by now

11:48  cryptr: perhaps you have to run a later kernel
11:48  cryptr: not sure, seems that the driver is not fully supporting your card
11:48  nsadmin: have you run alsaconf?
11:48  blast_hardcheese: 2.6.32 is all that's available in testing
11:48  cryptr: nsadmin: alsaconf is removed since ethc right?

11:48  nsadmin: not necessarily suggesting you do, but wondering

11:49  blast_hardcheese: Nothing anymore,
11:49  blast_hardcheese: but there have been people reporting some success with running alsaconf
11:49  nsadmin: so nothing at all sets alsa up
11:49  cryptr: afk lunch.
11:49  blast_hardcheese: No, nothing sets alsa up anymore
11:50  blast_hardcheese: It's all dynamic, the reason it was removed was because "The only valid use-case for alsaconf is aiding the configuration of ISA sound cards."
11:50  qq-: lspci -nn | grep Aud ?
11:50  Trewas: blast_hardcheese: 2.6.32 kernel is from late 2009, so it is quite possible it misses some fixes for new hw... and hda-intel soundcards are notorious for having million slightly different implementations
11:50 * nsadmin thinks that maintainers who think they know what's better for people "let's take away a little more of their control" should rethink themselves
11:50  nsadmin: anyone know why this was removed?
11:51  nsadmin: or was it factored into something, and if so what?

11:55  blast_hardcheese: qq-: It wasn't loaded, I have been doing a lot of alsa reloads

11:59  blast_hardcheese: Well, I need to go to sleep. I'll see what I can do about getting a newer kernel in testing...
11:59  nsadmin: but "invalid argument" usually means "number fed to ioctl is not one of the recognized values and this could mean something's not loaded or compiled into kernel"
11:59  blast_hardcheese: maybe bpo
12:01  nsadmin: see, a module load could add valid ioctl values, such that if it sees those it aims at the module

12:02  blast_hardcheese: Thanks a bunch for all the help, I really appreciate it

12:12  kotique: and what's up with this dep resolution ?
12:13  kotique: i'm trying to install a fucking bacula package and i can't
12:13  kotique: because it's trying to install damned 2.4 version

12:13 <-- debhelper has kicked kotique from #debian (use http://paste.debian.net or /msg dpkg paste)
12:13  kotique: no other deps whatsoever
12:13  kotique: why isn't installing it goddamnit
12:14  kotique: i have manually pressed "i" for each 5x version
12:14  kotique: and yet still it warns me about dep prolbems
12:14  stew: kotique: can you show us in a pastebin?
12:14  stew: kotique: and show us the output of "apt-cache policy"
12:15  stew: kotique: if you are running stable, you should generally not run into dependency problems
12:15  kotique:     --- bacula-doc (UNSATISFIED)
12:15  kotique: why is it in red? it should be in orage, it isn't an error, that's a suggestion
12:16  kotique: http://fpaste.org/Gnx0/
12:16  stew: kotique: how about "apt-cache policy bacula bacula-doc libc6"
12:16  kotique:   --\ Keep the following packages at their current version:
12:16  kotique:     bacula                                                          [UNINST]
12:17  kotique: if you're writing to user that he should KEEP that package, dont write UNINST on the same screen. It's absoluytely confusing.
12:17  kotique: if that's a suggestion that would resolve the conflict, why when I follow it, bacula packagte still isn't installed?
12:18  guzu: hello all
12:18  stew: kotique: i'd try "+bacula"
12:18  stew: kotique: but it would help to know what versions of these packages you were working with
12:18  guzu: can anyone give me a dcd binary?
12:18  guzu: from squeeze
12:18  kotique: the whole idea of conflict resolution is try to do anything in order to install the package. Not provide user a resolution that wouldn't install that package -- that's idiotic
12:19  RichiH: is there a way to read out vendor ID from a hdd via /proc or /sys? smartmontools are not, and can not be, installed
12:19  nsadmin: , file dcd
12:19  judd: dcd in lenny/i386: cdcd: etc/bash_completion.d/cdcd, usr/bin/cdcd; fvwm-crystal: usr/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm/components/functions/Mixer-cdcd, usr/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm/components/functions/Music-cdcd; cdcd-dbg: usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/cdcd; cdrecord: usr/bin/readcd; doc-iana: usr/share/doc/doc-iana/html/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.oma.dcd; zsh-beta: usr/share/zsh-
12:19  judd: beta/functions/Completion/Unix/_cdcd; zsh: usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/_cdcd
12:19  kotique: and you should've written specifically that the package won't be installed if the resolution is to be followed. not just hide that somewhere
12:19  kotique: stew, +bacula where?
12:19  nsadmin: guzu: what package it's from?
12:19  kotique: you mean the "+" -- thyat's how i'm doing it
12:20  stew: kotique: in the "accept this solution: [Yn]"
12:20  kotique: there's no accept solution

12:21  nsadmin: , file bin/dcd
12:21  judd: No packages were found with that file.
12:21  guzu: i tried compiling but i have wrong version of libraries and gave up
12:21  kotique: which is NOT the conflict resolution, it doens't resoolve anything fopr me. it just deselect the package I want to install
12:21  guzu: judd, oh, thank you.
12:21  stew: kotique: so this is problem, you are trying to mix the stable versions with the backports versions
12:21  nsadmin: , file bin/dcd --branch=testing
12:21  judd: (file <pattern> [--arch <i386>] [--release <lenny>] [--regex | --exact]) -- Returns packages that include files matching <pattern> which, by default, is interpreted as a glob (see glob(7)). If --regex is given, the pattern is treated as a extended regex (see regex(7); note not PCRE!). If --exact is given, the exact filename is required. The current stable release and i386 are searched by default.
12:21  nsadmin: release
12:22  kotique: the wholke reason of including backports is to be able to install latest bacula
12:22  nsadmin: , file bin/dcd --release testing
12:22  kotique: come on guys, what's wrong with your distro?
12:22  judd: No packages were found with that file.
12:22  guzu: hmm
12:22  nsadmin: kotique: every one of the ~3000 maintainers will tell you something different to answer that
12:22  stew: kotique: try exiting the ui and running "aptitude -t lenny-backports install bacula"
12:23  stew: kotique: and SHOW us the output in a pastebin with the output of "apt-cache policy bacula bacula-doc libc6"
12:23  kotique: also, how do I specify version of the package on the console?
12:23  kotique: on gentoo, i do =package-1.2.34., on rhel - package-1.2.34.
12:24  kotique: how is it doine on debian?
12:24  nsadmin: this is not even close to gentoo, you can't do those things
12:24  stew: kotique: packate=version
12:24  nsadmin: what you can probably do is backport
12:24  kotique: wait, are you telling me there's no method of specifying what specific version of package I want to be installed?
12:24  stew: RichiH: i can get the vendor model string, but not the vendor id
12:24  nsadmin: kotique, gentoo is a compile-the-source kind of dist, debian is a binary dist
12:25  RichiH: stew: i'll go with that
12:25  RichiH: how?
12:25  kotique: gentoo can be whatever you want, they have bindist packages too
12:25  stew: RichiH: hal-find-by-capability --capability storage | while read a ; do hal-get-property --udi $a --key info.product ; done
12:25  kotique: pre-compiled
12:25  stew: kotique: i'm telling you exactly how to specify the version of a package you want to install
12:26  kotique: "aptitude -t lenny-backports install bacula" shows me right solution, but it wants to install mysql-server, really, this isn't what I want
12:26  RichiH: stew: i would prefer to read it from /proc or /sys directly
12:26  BlackFate: kotique, apt-get install packer=version -t source
12:26  stew: RichiH: are you looking in /sys/class/block ?  i dunno
12:26  kotique: I don't even undertstand that english word
12:26  BlackFate: packer/package*
12:26  nsadmin: kotique: debian is not always "whatever you want", it's binary with very few exceptions and the binaries are tested to see to it they work together
12:27  nsadmin: kotique, I dunno... you may like that, you may not
12:27  kotique: http://fpaste.org/9UE6/
12:27  kotique: why would it want me to install mysql-server, really?:) i know bacula can store catalogue in mysql db, but mysql client should be enough for it
12:28  nsadmin: hmm, actually that's a good point
12:29  kotique: http://fpaste.org/SJQh/ -- "apt-cache policy bacula bacula-doc libc6"
12:29  nsadmin: it should depend on some client
12:29  stew: kotique: what command did you run resulting in installing mysql?
12:29  nsadmin: you're installing from backports?
12:29  kotique: I don't know what I do now. Yes, I'm trying to install from lenny-backports.
12:29  stew: kotique: you can ask it.  "aptitude why mysql-server"
12:30  kotique: stew, http://fpaste.org/VUZI/
12:30  stew: ahh, its a recommends
12:30  stew: kotique: at the Accept this solution? [Y/n/q/?]  you can possibly say "-mysql-server"
12:31  stew: kotique: you can also install telling it to ignore "recommends" by adding "--without-recommends" to the aptitude command line
12:31  kotique: but this is crazy, you see, even you don't understand what's going on. IMagine what a newbie user would think
12:31  RichiH: stew: that does not even exist on lenny, but i could use it on one of the machines, at least
12:31  RichiH: thanks
12:31  nsadmin: well let's take just this case... are you a newbie?
12:31  kotique: -mysql-server didn't cure it
12:31  stew: a newbie user should expect the recommended package by definition
12:32  kotique: yes I am
12:32  stew: kotique: then use --without-recommends
12:32  kotique: look at the above chat
12:32  nsadmin: I'd rather take it from your own defn
12:32  nsadmin: how will you know when you're not?
12:32  stew: i'm not sure why this is crazy.  when you follow the backports instructions, it does something sane
12:33  kotique: aptitude --without-recommends  -t lenny-backports install bacula
12:33  Bushmills: aptitude, run interactively, has a config option to turn selection of recommends off. a newbie can find that option.

12:33  Bushmills: unless he doesn't look, or is keen to argue about the sense of including recommends into selection
12:34  nsadmin: one thing is true, when you're new to something, there will be some concepts that may be central you're not understanding yet
12:34  nsadmin: what's bacula other than the actor that plays enterprise capn?
12:35  kotique: The problem is that I've read some of http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html and there's little about conflict resolution
12:36  stew: kotique: you don't seem to be having any conflict resolution problems
12:36  stew: that I've seen
12:36  nsadmin: theres probably more in the packaging manual
12:36  nsadmin: right, not actually a conflict
12:36  stew: and when you are sticking to stable, there typically aren't conflict resolution problems
12:36  ubiquitous1980: is it normal not to have gnome on cd 1 for squeeze beta 1
12:36  kotique: well, when I for example request kernel package to be installed and instead I get python, that's not the right "conflict resolution"
12:37  kotique: making an analogy with the above tourne

12:38  nsadmin: oh, not python but perl
12:38  kotique: analagy
12:38  kotique: I know it depeneded on bacula-sd-slite3, but it wanted to install it instead of the package I requested

12:39  kotique: that's probably why it wanted to have mysql server ready
12:40  stew: kotique: yes, as a recommendation, not as a requirement

12:42  kotique: really, i want just sqlite3 DB, not mysql.
12:43  stew: kotique: that's what you are getting
12:43  kotique: going to wipe it out and try again. hold on for more action ;)
12:43  stew: why
12:43  stew: kotique: you see that it is installing bacula-director-sqlite3 libsqlite0 sqlite3
12:43  stew: bacula-common-sqlite3
12:44  kotique: well, I look at lines "Install the following packages:", "Remove the following packages:"
12:44  stew: kotique: look a few lines up "The following NEW packages will be installed"
12:44  stew: kotique: the ""Install the following packages:", "Remove the following packages:" refers to what it is doing about "The following packages have unmet dependencies"
12:44  Number5_: hello guys, I want to start learning php programming, but when executing a simple php script using shell, I get permission denied. I work on Lenny. How to solve permission denied...? My php is located at /usr/bin/php.
12:44  kotique: I don't get your package manager, really7.
12:44  stew: kotique: what don't you get about it?
12:45  kotique: okay, now everyting's clear
12:45  nsadmin: kotique: debian ropes you in a bit more than gentoo, and much more than things like slack and linux-from-scratch... are you a "yes" to being roped in? :)
12:45  kotique: it's non intuitive. When you output somehthing, make sure it's written clearly. So I don't have to go up the screen and understand what belongs to where
12:45  kotique: I'm defginitely no
12:46  stew: kotique: make it so that some of the output is completely ignorable becauase you only want to read the last few lines?
12:46  kotique: i'm that kind of guy who would steal a good movie instead of watching some artistic crap
12:46  kotique: thus, i'm all about enterprise, centos and epel
12:46  stew: kotique: i guess you want it to NOT tell you how it is going to satisfy your bacula desires?
12:47  stew: so don't tell you about installing sqllite until you tell it how to deal with the broken bacula-sd-mysql package?
12:47  nsadmin: aha. if you're a "no" to that, you should look closer and see if debian would serve you in a way that has you feel comfortable
12:47  stew: that would make much less sense in most scenarios
12:47  kotique: stew, understand that I'm just an admin, I don't flip bits in package manager's database, i'm an end user for package manager
12:47  nsadmin: if you're still a "no"...
12:47  stew: kotique: ok?
12:47  stew: kotique: so you don't want to read the output, but you want to understand what it is going to do without reading it
12:47  stew: or something
12:48  stew: you aren't going to get what you want here, sorry
12:48  nsadmin: then maybe you dn't like debian... I dunno for sure, since I'm not you
12:48  stew: its clear he doesnt
12:48  nsadmin: but I simply offer that as a point of thought for you to consider
12:48  kotique: okay, i've got the problem.  You should indent  "The following actions will resolve these dependencies:" from the rest of output. make a newline or two
12:49  stew: kotique: make a patch, and submit it as a wishlist bug to the aptitude package
12:49  kotique: The following packages are BROKEN: should be indented too, put a newline before it
12:49  stew: shoudl be a simple patch
12:49  nsadmin: kotique: right, patches > rants :)
12:50  stew: well its the only realistic way the change is going to happen, short of someone getting paid to do it
12:51  kotique: that's why I like rhel derived products - really, I open a bug, pretend i'm a rhel user and they fix it, it goes into centos relaease
12:51  kotique: but don't tell anyone
12:51  stew: unlike redhat, debian is all volunteer developed
12:52  kotique: you know what, it's all fine when I press accept solution, it shows what's going to be installed, removed. which is aboslutely okay
12:52  stew: so if you have an itch you want scratched,  best to scratch it yourself instead of waiting for someone else to get the same itch
12:52  smv: indenting will never be a solution for those that don't read the output.
12:52  nsadmin: I'm pretty sure redhat is owned by the same venture capitalists that bought and gutted arsdigita
12:53  nsadmin: if that's the case... -watch out-... they also own cygnus
12:53  kotique: stew, you're telling that to someone who hacked rhel CA source and immplemented the functionality he needed
12:54  kotique: smv, it will be, trust me, it's the hunman nature - if you see something in bulk, you think it belongs to that bulk/group.
12:54  kotique: if it's separate, then it's separate
12:54  stew: kotique: "apt-get source aptitude" will get you the source then
12:54  kotique: okay, now I want to update the kernel
12:55  nsadmin: kotique: I don't necessarily agree with stew more than half the time... but he's right here in my opinion: he's just saying "supply a patch"
12:55  stew: nsadmin: :(
12:55  stew: nsadmin: you should agree with me 100% always

12:57  ubiquitous1980: I am installing debian squeeze in vbox, why does gnome not get installed automatically
12:58  stew: ubiquitous1980: did you choose the "desktop" task?
12:58  ubiquitous1980: might have missed it, it defaulted to ncurses installer
12:58  stew: ubiquitous1980: yes, it defaults to a ncurses installer,  not that it matters much, the graphical installer is exactly the same with nicer fonts
12:59  ubiquitous1980: so the ncurses installer had the desktop task, I just missed it?
12:59  stew: ubiquitous1980: but at the end you are asked if you want a [] standard install [] Web server [] desktop...
12:59  ubiquitous1980: well I am a goat then
12:59  stew: if you checked desktop there you should get gnome.   you can get it now with "tasksel install desktop"

13:02  negge: I'm trying to get Debian running on a very old IBM Thinkpad (model 365XD to be exact). I've managed to boot Lenny on it successfully, but the console only uses a small part of the screen (like when a laptop is booting windows XP you know), and I can't seem to change it. Any hints?

13:07  fruitwerks: I am having trouble getting my cron settings right.. some of my scripts handle reporting internally - that is all good, but I can't figure out how to stop getting emails for the stuff I don't need to know about, and I can't find where 'mailto' is set
13:08  stew: fruitwerks: it sends to the user running the job
13:08  stew: unless MAILTO is set explicitly
13:08  fruitwerks: I read that.. so where is that email defined in the absence of mailto?
13:08  stew: it goes to the user running the job
13:09  babilen: fruitwerks: You can use I/O redirection in your cron jobs -- e.g. "cmd 1>/dev/null 2>&1" will provide no output *at all*
13:09  stew: who it ultimately is delivered to might be effected by /etc/alias
13:09  fruitwerks: ok - well somehow they are getting forwarded to gmail
13:09  stew: aliasa*
13:09  stew: i can't type
13:10  stew: fruitwerks: check /etc/aliases or your mail server settings to see why that user's mail is getting sent to gmail
13:10  BlackFate: fruitwerks, you use ssmtp?
13:11  fruitwerks: ssmtp is not instaled, and aliases has no real / routable email addy's defined
13:12  babilen: fruitwerks: exim4 as smarthost?
13:13  fruitwerks: exim is installed..
13:14  fruitwerks: where are the exim 'aliases'?
13:17  negge: stew: I get no list of modes when running hwinfo --framebuffer
13:18  negge: if I set vga=scan when booting I just get to choose how many characters I want on my screen, not the actual resolution
13:18  stew: negge: yeah, because vga=scan isn't using framebuffer
13:18  stew: negge: you ran hwinfo in a console, not in X, right?

14:06  ubiquitous1980: and I cbf sshing into a vbox machine
14:06  abrotman: judd: versions pastebinit
14:06  judd: Package pastebinit on i386 -- lenny: 0.10-2lenny1; sid: 1.1-2; squeeze: 1.1-2; experimental: 1.1-3
14:06  abrotman: voila
14:06  nsadmin: viola?
14:06  ubiquitous1980: well that would be nice if the package management system was playing nice right now :)
14:07  nsadmin: grab the .deb
14:07  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: aptitude update && aptitude install pastebinit .. what doesn't work ?
14:07  ubiquitous1980: abrotman, it simply can't find pastebinit
14:08  abrotman: then sounds like you don't have your sources setup correctly, or your network is broken
14:08  nsadmin: when you say "it's in a vm sorry" what does that mean?
14:08  ubiquitous1980: Couldn't find any package whose name or description matched "pastebinit"
14:08  abrotman: nsadmin: stop
14:08  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: do you have a line like "deb http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main" in your /etc/apt/sources.list ?
14:08  nsadmin: not until and unless you state reason.
14:08  abrotman: you're not helping
14:09  nsadmin: proof
14:09  abrotman: proof you are? :)
14:09  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: or do you only have the CD lines?
14:09  ubiquitous1980: that is interesting, it only has the cd and updates
14:09  ubiquitous1980: that is quite odd
14:09  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: add the line i gave above .. then `aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade` .. then run tasksel, see if there is a desktop task now
14:10  abrotman: or if you'd prefer a different mirror in .au, let me know, there are quite a few
14:10  nsadmin: nevermind, it's your opinion, and I don't agree
14:10  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: actually, hold on, your ISP has a mirror
14:10  ubiquitous1980: abrotman, yes it does
14:10  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: add this line instead "deb http://ftp.iinet.net.au/debian/debian/ squeeze main"
14:11 * abrotman won't ask about that directory structure
14:11  nsadmin: that ought to be quick too
14:11  ubiquitous1980: yeah not too bad
14:11  ubiquitous1980: they host lots of stuff
14:12 * abrotman wishes either his work ISP or home ISP had a mirror
14:12  ubiquitous1980: just quite odd that tasksel isn't working properly out of the box
14:12  ubiquitous1980: my isp rocks
14:12  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: you weren't referencing any sources that had a Desktop to install
14:12  ubiquitous1980: it supports GNU/Linux heavily if you haven't noticed.
14:12  ubiquitous1980: well the cd has the files
14:12  ubiquitous1980: so it is odd
14:12  JKL_: has anyone here implemented password authentication for gitolite?
14:12  abrotman: oh, yes .. CD1 .. Oh well
14:13  abrotman: you want more than that anyway
14:13  ubiquitous1980: is there a bug out on that?
14:13  nsadmin: abrotman: look at this: http://ftp.iinet.net.au/debian
14:13  nsadmin: that pretty much explains the structure
14:13  abrotman: right, and?
14:13  nsadmin: that pretty much explains the structure
14:13  abrotman: not really, but okay
14:13  nsadmin: youi're just saying it could be better
14:13  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: Did you finish your update yet? did you re-run tasksel yet?
14:14  ubiquitous1980: yeah rerunning tasksel, has the required entry now
14:14  ubiquitous1980: so very odd.
14:14  ubiquitous1980: well now this is working I must be off
14:14  ubiquitous1980: :)
14:14  ubiquitous1980: i will be back another time.
14:14  abrotman: required? :)
14:14  ubiquitous1980: graphical desktop environment
14:14  abrotman: ubiquitous1980: enjoy!
14:15  ubiquitous1980: thanks mate, you too and thanks also nsadmin for the entertainment
14:16  nsadmin: see? I did help!
14:16  chicogngnuu: the channel bot has a hardware identification
14:16  chicogngnuu: from where it takes information ?
14:16  nsadmin: you mean judd and pciid, right?
14:16  Rhisa: Hi.
14:16  chicogngnuu: nsadmin, yes
14:16  nsadmin: you probably can ask themill, but judd is a front end to udd, ultimate debian database
14:16  abrotman: yes .. you were "entertaining" .. that's not helping
14:17  abrotman: chicogngnuu: i believe that's out of date, but you can /msg dpkg hcl if you want something similar
14:18  chicogngnuu: tks
14:21  kusanagi_: where is the PATH read from? I have a daemon running in a computer. I need to change its path to be able to find some files... the daemon is launched via system init.d. Where can i modify this PATH?
14:21  negge: stew: still no luck unfortunately
14:23 * G69 Boa tarde
14:24  nsadmin: kusanagi_: each different program that is set up so it can run at the same time as another, is a "process", each process has its own environment vars, PATH is one
14:24  cryptr: kusanagi_: /etc/bash.bashrc if using bash as shell or .profile and .bashrc
14:24  abrotman: what about /etc/profile ?
14:25  cryptr: add that to the list also, and PATH in the script
14:25  nsadmin: it depends on whether those variables get copied into the server daemon's process
14:25  nsadmin: the daemon itself could set its own PATH
14:25  abrotman: he could just prepend the init script starting line perhaps
14:26  nsadmin: you mean like PATH=foo /etc/init.d/somethign restart?
14:26  chicogngnuu: judd, pciid 8086:0044
14:27  judd: [8086:0044] is 'Core Processor DRAM Controller' from 'Intel Corporation' with no known kernel module in lenny or in sid. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=8086:0044
14:27  kusanagi_: mmm i guess i could add the PATH to the init.d script
14:27  kusanagi_: thanks!
14:27  nsadmin: kusanagi_: besure to export it
14:27  abrotman: chicogngnuu: as i said above, i believe that's out of date
14:27  kusanagi_: export PATH=blahbla:$PATH
14:27  kusanagi_: sure thanks nsadmin ;D
14:27  nsadmin: yeah
14:27  nsadmin: and note that you might also want...
14:28  nsadmin: to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
14:28  kusanagi_: what is that?
14:28  chicogngnuu: abrotman, np, are usefull enough to me even if out of date
14:28  nsadmin: path to dynamic libs
14:28  nsadmin: look at /etc/ld.so.conf
14:28  chicogngnuu: judd, pciid 8086:0046
14:28  judd: [8086:0046] is 'Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller' from 'Intel Corporation' with no known kernel module in lenny but has kernel module 'i915' in sid. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=8086:0046
14:28  abrotman: chicogngnuu: you can msg the bot
14:28  kusanagi_: also, maybe ill add another script, because I want this entry to be first entry in the PATH... so it get this executables first
14:28  yareckon: i have a debian lenny vm that I am setting up and it is hanging forever tring to connect to security.debian.org
14:29  yareckon: 35% [Connecting to security.debian.org (2001:8d8:2:1:6564:a62:0:2)]
14:29  yareckon: had this issue last month too on another install
14:29  yareckon: anyone know a solution?
14:29  yareckon: eventually it connects, but it's getting to be a real annoyance
14:31  yareckon: could it be that a server has new dns or something?
14:32  nsadmin: kusanagi_: so then you want to prepend to path (add the new stuff to the left side)
14:33  nsadmin: adding to the right side looks like this: PATH=$PATH:/new/stuff:/another/new/dir
14:33  nsadmin: which means it would be searched after all the original dirs in PATH have been searched
14:34  nsadmin: adding to the left side looks like this: PATH=/new/stuff:/another/new/dir:$PATH
14:35  kusanagi_: nsadmin, yeah, no, but i am gonna add another script and run it the last one
14:35  kusanagi_: nsadmin, because another script could add some stuff
14:35  itchi: !tell yareckon about security.debian.org
14:36  yareckon: I don't appear to be being told...
14:37  itchi: !security.debian.org
14:37  dpkg: Put "deb http://security.debian.org lenny/updates main contrib non-free" in your /etc/apt/sources.list file to keep up-to-date on security updates in stable.

14:37  abrotman: itchi: i think he's already done that ..
14:37  CutMeOwnThroat: yareckon, sounds a bit like a dns problem...
14:37  itchi: abrotman: i thought
14:37  abrotman: seems like DNS or ipv6
14:38  yareckon: does seem that way
14:38  yareckon: logging in at home gives me the same ipv4 dns results though
14:38  CutMeOwnThroat: see if nslookup/dig takes long
14:38  ondrejk: hello, we're going to build new debian servers and im wondering if use of ext2 for /var/log directory will affect server performance, what fs for /var/log are you using?
14:38  joltcan: ondrejk: I hope you mean ext3?
14:38  itchi: ondrejk: the ext3
14:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 851]
14:39  ondrejk: my colleague uses ext2 for /var/log because it doesnt have an jurnal
14:39  abrotman: ondrejk: why not use ext3, the journaling isn't much of a performance hit and it makes your data a bit safer
14:39  itchi: almost everyone use ext3 except for special cases
14:39  ondrejk: he says its better for this directory, so i wanted to ask more peoples ..
14:39  abrotman: did you ask him why?
14:40  ondrejk: abrotman: because of ext2 doesn not have an jurnal
14:40  CutMeOwnThroat: that's not a reason
14:40  ondrejk: so it will not hit server performance
14:40  yareckon: how much are you logging
14:40  ttiicc: I really wonder why debian is not calling the testing version as desktop!? do you guys get the point?
14:41  itchi: ondrejk: Seems you and you friend have another definition of better
14:41  ondrejk: yareckon: it will be webservers with many many visitors
14:41  yareckon: cutting down that will improve yer perf more than changing to a non journaled filesystem
14:41  abrotman: ondrejk: on a modern system it would be like 0.000000001%
14:41  icebrain: ttiicc: what? lots of people use Stable as desktop
14:41  nsadmin: ttiicc: not the original intent, and not what it's used for
14:41  itchi: ondrejk: You mean faster, and that's it, but not better, better will be somethings more secure (and probably a little bit slower)
14:41  abrotman: ttiicc: because it's "testing' not "Desktop" .. it's not confusing at all
14:42  yareckon: ondrejk, I would want whatever I am trying to "log" by definition to be more secure
14:42  abrotman: ondrejk: he could mount it noatime and probably offset that penalty ..
14:42  nsadmin: ttiicc: you're trying to drive home the point that testing should be desktop because it's newer
14:42  abrotman: ondrejk: of course .. you could just benchmark the whole thing and prove us wrong :)
14:42  ttiicc: stable it's to stable for desktops, it's only used for servers. testing on the otherhand is stable enough for desktops and the program are more upto date!
14:42  itchi: Or event don't log if your realy don't care
14:42  ondrejk: abrotman: im not saying you're wrong, i just wanted to ask :)
14:43  abrotman: ttiicc: that's wrong .. please don't say that
14:43  babilen: ttiicc: testing is not stable at all
14:43  abrotman: ttiicc: there are times when 'testing' is a complete mess and not suitable for a desktop
14:43  yareckon: ondrejk, look up benchmarks for ext3 vs ext2, or do some benchmarking with apachebench (ab) or seige
14:43  abrotman: yareckon: i think Tso just did some
14:43  babilen: !tell ttiicc -about stable
14:43  abrotman: or maybe that was ext4 and ext3
14:43  ondrejk: ok, thank guys :)
14:43  yareckon: there is a performance penaldy for jurnaling, but not much
14:43  lord_rob: isn't possible to use ext3 without a journal ? does that mean ext2 ?
14:44  yareckon: basically
14:44  nsadmin: ttiicc, like a coupla weeks ago,... testing wasn't installable for a moment
14:44  abrotman: http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/ .. yeah, it was ext3 vs ext4
14:44  ttiicc: ok I give up! but still I sees the stable version only for servers and the testing version only as my desktop version which I use at home
14:44  abrotman: whoops .. stpuid colors
14:44  abrotman: ttiicc: that's fine .. but don't tell others that .. it's not true
14:45  abrotman: testing may seem 'stable' right now, but about three weeks after squeeze releases it will probably be pretty buggy
14:45  nsadmin: ttiicc, some desktop users want well-tested stuff
14:45 * SlayerXP tries to understand the concept of "too stable for desktops"
14:46  ttiicc: hahaha okej there you had a point abrotman
14:46  smiler: SlayerXP: s/stable/old/ and it might be easier to grasp
14:46  iess: there are over 800 bugs in lenny
14:46  abrotman: RC bugs .. there are way more general bugs
14:46 * smv is using ext4 with noatime on a very slow system and is as fast as ext2 on the same system
14:46  nsadmin: SlayerXP: most desktop tables have really strong wooden legs, so the top of the desktop can be more shakyer
14:46  iceroot: i am building a dep and using install on a directory. i get this inflating: plg_jckeditor/jckeditor/plugins/templates/templates/default.jsplg_jckeditor/jckeditor/plugins/templates/templates/images/:  ucsize 2988 <> csize 0 for STORED entry continuing with "compressed" size value  ls -all is showing me the size of 2988 for default.js, so what is the problem here?

14:51  bolt: http://pastebin.com/Xc0pSQit  <-- can anyone tell me why this doesn't work as I expect? I want it to close the connection when I say "exit". instead, it seems to halfway restart and then print an error and crash as soon as i type something else.
14:57  xyan: bolt: your exit function just breaks out of your read line while loop, gets back into the while true loop and starts again.. put an explicit exit under your echo "connection closed"?
14:58  NginUS: why is the column called 'IO>' always at 99% on my server, even when 'Disk Read' & 'Disk Write' are at 0 M/s?
14:58  abrotman: NginUS: in which application ?
14:58  NginUS: iotop
14:58  bolt: xyan: but shouldn't breaking the read line loop stop netcat, and thus the telnet session?
14:59 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 858]
14:59  abrotman: NginUS: the iowait% means things waiting for IO .. something could be blocking IO
14:59  et: slow nfs or something, or broken disks ;)
14:59  bolt: xyan: i want it to disconect the current client and be ready to accept new ones, so i wouldn't want to just exit
14:59  NginUS: abrotman : thanks, I couldn't find what that column was.
15:00  abrotman: man top ?
15:00  NginUS: i did maniotop, k thx
15:00  CutMeOwnThroat: bolt, tried the kvm package in squeeze after we talked about it... seems horrible slow, though - and either stalling or hanging at some time  :-/
15:00  xyan: bolt: hrm well you start telnet from your client so i dont think the server can close it at all. im not sure if you can send a exit signal or something
15:00  xyan: bolt: but year exiting the server is a bad idea in that case
15:01  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: mine works perfectly, and is blazing fast compared to vmware...
15:01  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: kvm is very hardware dependent, though
15:02  CutMeOwnThroat: I guess something is wrong... but really hard to find out what - kvm is enabled, it's not just regular qemu emulation, I know that
15:02  Guest43116: hi all ... i have a quick question .. have a box with 3 ip's and i want to forward all connections to port 80 on ip 2 to port 9090 of the same ip any sugestions?
15:02  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: qemu is rather slow, yes
15:02  iess: you can try -drive xxxx,cache=writeback
15:03  bolt: xyan: if I just do "netcat -l -p 1234", then connect with telnet and proceed to stop netcat (ctrl+c), telnet disconnects. i don't see why the same doesn't happen in my script.
15:03  xyan: bolt: run netcat verbose and see if it traps the ctrl+c and sends some magic over to telnet
15:03 --- DaRtH_VaDeR is now known as Indiana_Jones
15:04  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: have you tried asking #kvm though? they might know, based on your CPU and such
15:04  nsadmin: Guest43116: seems like a simple iptables rule will do that
15:04  icebrain: Guest43116: http://wiki.kartbuilding.net/index.php/Iptables_forward
15:04  CutMeOwnThroat: hm, no... played around with it a bit, read the page on performance on their website...
15:04  xyan: bolt: other than that you could try to kill -SIGINT the netcat session by your server script and hope that the same thing as hitting ctrl+c will happen
15:04  bolt: xyan: doesn't seem like it. it even states "sent: 0, recv: 0"
15:05  iess: kvm -drive file=xxx.img,cache=writebak,aio=native
15:06  iess: replace cache=writethrough to writeback can reduce the io to hard disk and improve the write speed
15:07  CutMeOwnThroat:  kvm  -m 2047mb -smp 2 -usb -usbdevice tablet  -localtime image.img is what I had
15:07  djura-san: o/
15:07  CutMeOwnThroat: -snapshot, actually, as else the crash would render the image unusable
15:08  CutMeOwnThroat: qemu: invalid cache option
15:08  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: try installing virt-manager and make a machine there, perhaps. it does a lot of the options work for you
15:08  CutMeOwnThroat: oh, 'c'  missing :)
15:09  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: also, it has nice graphs
15:09  iess: sorry ,back
15:09  CutMeOwnThroat: bolt, libvirtd has to run as root?
15:09  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: think so
15:09  CutMeOwnThroat: but the vm can run as a regular user?
15:11  bolt: CutMeOwnThroat: hm.. actually both libvirt and all my vm's are running as the user "libvirt-qemu"
15:12  CutMeOwnThroat: I see
15:12  brbrbr: hi all
15:12  CutMeOwnThroat: I'll give it a shot, thanks

15:49  dury: stew: foo it will be the file name... is it correct?
15:50  stew: yes, "identify filename" will tell you if imagemagick knows how to deal with that type of file.  if it will, convert will convert it to any other format it knows how to deal with
15:51  dury: stew: right. :)
15:51  dury: stew: I will
15:57  dury: stew : it says . identify: no decode delegate for this image format "foo.ec3"

16:23  abrotman: what is?
16:23  terminator: The error that I am getting

16:23  abrotman: i'm guessing he manually removed the module file from /etc/apache2/mods-available/
16:23  karlpinc: terminator: Yes, pay attention to what abrotman had the bot tell you.
16:24  terminator: I used aptitude to remove and purga apache2
16:24  abrotman: so when it reinstalls the package, it doesn't reinstall that file, and then when it tries to enable it, it freaks out because that file doesn't exist
16:24  abrotman: terminator: see what the bot told you .. try it, see if it works

16:33  dpkg: no idea, terminator
16:33  abrotman: !confmiss
16:33  dpkg: The reason you have to use dpkg --force-confmiss is because whenever your config files (<conffiles>) are gone, dpkg assumes you deleted them on purpose, and that you want them to stay deleted.  You can also reinstall them using the following apt-get line: apt-get -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall install <packagename>; or using aptitude, aptitude -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" reinstall <packagename>.

16:37  abrotman: use aptitude ...
16:38  abrotman: you were using aptitude before, the bot has an aptitude sample .. why would you use apt-get now ?
16:38  terminator: I do not know what command switches you want me to try with aptitude
16:38  nsadmin: it -was- the first sample

17:00  stew: K0JIbKA: what do you mean by "available"?  is it not already available?
17:01  K0JIbKA: stew: nope
17:01  stew: minver: these things are always easier to debug from the server side: /msg dpkg debug sshd
17:01  stew: K0JIbKA: what makes you think its not available?  what are you trying?

17:02  stew: K0JIbKA: you ping what from where?
17:02  K0JIbKA: i can ping Debian machine from Win XP
17:02  K0JIbKA: but not reverse
17:03  stew: K0JIbKA: can the debian machine ping other machines?  like google.com?

17:03  K0JIbKA: stew: yes it can ping Internet, router but not home LAN
17:04  stew: K0JIbKA: this isn't a problem with debian then, its a problem with windows responding to ping
17:04  stew: K0JIbKA: try ##windows
17:05  Bushmills: probably windows firewall
17:05  K0JIbKA: say it's not pinging it NOW. yesterday, when i forgot to filter out Win XP machine it was catching ping no problem
17:05  minver: stew: It says "Failed password for root". 1. Can I log in as root with putty? 2. Are there any chars that I can't write on windows computer? its just letters, numbers and ] in the pw.

17:05  Bushmills: file a bug report for ping ...

17:08  minver: CutMeOwnThroat: ah okay
17:08  stew: minver: a root loging will work with putty if it works with some other ssh client

17:08  akio: abrotman: Asking you as you are always here and I figured you would know this: Why does my mount output show two dashes for every one like I put in fstab name column?
17:08  stew: and if they weren't, the error wouldnt' be "failed password"
17:09  CutMeOwnThroat: right... that's what I meant with "not fundamentally different" - you should figure out if it's a problem on the client side or on the server side... if it only happens with one client, then it's on the client-side and you shouldn't ask us, as that seems to be on windows
17:10  abrotman: akio: put it in a pastebin, not making sense the way you're describing it

18:18  a_run: lenny
18:18  peterrooney: "you're braver than I thought"
18:18  a_run: the keys used to work fine
18:18  a_run: i think they stopped after a kernel upgrade
18:18  a_run: brightness keys works
18:18  a_run: no suspend or wifi
18:18  a_run: :(
18:18  jhutchins: a_run: You seem to be running a Lenny kernel.
18:19  pyr00: babilen: thanks for all your help... cookies are on the way.. haha
18:19  a_run: jhutchins: that's right
18:20  jhutchins: a_run: Be careful not to mix distributions - it's likely to lead to a clean reinstall.
18:20  a_run: i didn't
18:20  a_run: this is a clean install of lenny
18:20  babilen: pyr00: So, any progress? do you use n-m and does it see the device? what about wvdial? (before and after the modprobe?) What about the find commands detailed on the 3G wiki page?
18:20  jhutchins: a_run: So they were working without any particular intervention before, now they don't, and the blasted kernel update didn't increment the version.
18:21  jhutchins: a_run: An update on that level _shouldn't_ affect hardware detection/activation.
18:21  babilen: pyr00: Hmm, looks as if you decided to do some reading first :) Have fun and good luck
18:21  a_run: i have the latest kernel
18:21  pyr00: yea reading and some food...
18:21  a_run: i booted into the default one just to see if it workes
18:21  pyr00: i'll be around and will update you on what worked and didnt
18:21  pyr00: thanks again
18:21  jhutchins: a_run: Just a random "flick the switch off and on" try would be to install the .32 kernel from backports.
18:22  jhutchins: a_run: On my system that nocks out the SCSI scanner that works fine on .26
18:22  jhutchins: a_run: The other thing to look at would be a configuration change that affected the keymap, and, again, the hotkeys package.
18:22  a_run: 2.6.32-bpo.5-686 is what i have
18:22  jhutchins: a_run: Not according to yth eline you posted above, that says your'e running .26.
18:23  jhutchins: a_run: So it may be as simple as rebooting.
18:23  a_run: yes, i booted into older kernel just to see if the keys work
18:23  a_run: they don't
18:27  bolt: xyan: hey. i had to run to a meeting. thanks for the updated netcat script. i'll play with it now :)
18:29  JKL_: can ssh gateway be configured to use second username and password?
18:30  a_run: brb
18:30  stew: JKL_: what do you mean by "ssh gateway"?
18:32  JKL_: stew: i mean a box that have a public ip and accepts connections from internet
18:32  JKL_: and redirects connections to local ssh server
18:32  JKL_: http://tumblr.spantz.org/post/211936636/configuring-an-ssh-gateway like this
18:32  JKL_: but i would like to know if this is possible without authorized_keys
18:33 --- D4rKr0W is now known as D4rKr0W`afk
18:33  stew: JKL_: yes, and yes
18:33  JKL_: from user point of view it would be somethinkgs like: 1:ssh gw@host.com 2:myusername 3:mypassword
18:33  stew: well
18:34  stew: JKL_: why wouldn't you want to use authorized_keys?
18:34  JKL_: i wouldnt want to
18:34  JKL_: but some corporations are what they are
18:34  JKL_: :)
18:35 --- Eclipser is now known as Zharf
18:37  jhutchins: a_run: Ok, so the keys don't work under either kernel, the kernel is not the problem.
18:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 852]
18:39  stew: JKL_: i would look at "ForceCommand" in the sshd
18:39  JKL_: stew: ok. i will take a look
18:39  JKL_: thx
18:40  stew: JKL_: in sshd_config that is
18:42  JKL_: stew: what could be forced command? i think that asking the 2nd username is a problem here
18:45  stew: JKL_: i thought the page you were linking to was using command= in authorized_keys to do the same as ForceCommand
18:46  JKL_: stew: but when using the ssh key the actual user can be known based on the key
18:46  stew: JKL_: i thought you were going to create multiple users though
18:47  stew: JKL_: so this will work for one user per command
18:47  JKL_: i would not like to do that
18:47  stew: < ~JKL_> can ssh gateway be configured to use second username and password
18:47  stew: i thought that's where we were going from that
18:48  JKL_: ok, np
18:48  stew: JKL_: so you want a different command depending on what?
18:49  JKL_: so 1. the client should be able to to connect with ssh gw@host.com
18:49  JKL_: then host should ask the correct username and password
18:50  JKL_: if i know the correct username, it should be trivial to do the rest

19:02  Kyoku: what's the line i need to add to sources to get unstable stuff please?
19:04  somiaj: Kyoku: why do you want unstable stuff?
19:04  Kyoku: i want eclipse
19:04  Kyoku: but it's in unstable :(
19:04  somiaj: Kyoku: it is very bad form to mix distributions, you do not want to just install a few unstable programs on a stable system
19:04  somiaj: Kyoku: look into backports
19:04  somiaj: !tell Kyoku about backports
19:05  Kyoku: ok maybe i'll put it on another machine instead, thanks.. i don't want to break this one
19:05  qq-: , versions eclipse
19:05  judd: Package eclipse on i386 -- etch: 3.2.1-4; squeeze: 3.5.2-6squeeze1; sid: 3.5.2-8
19:06  somiaj: hmm, strange it wasn't in lenny, well I'd still suggest looking for a backport, though creating a simple sid backport isn't to diffcult for many applications
19:07  simonrvn: too*
19:07  Kyoku: i love debian's stability too much to break it, i'll put eclipse on ubuntu instead, thanks for help somiaj
19:09  Boohemian: is there an application switcher like what they have on OS X for linux?

19:16  Boohemian: ?
19:17  themill: diago: sounds like you need to file a  bug for your irc client
19:17  stew: Boohemian: no
19:17  Boohemian: i'm getting 'can't find server'
19:17  themill: Boohemian: screenshots.debian.net seems to be, yes

19:17  simonrvn: screenshots.debian.net is conn. refused

19:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 866]
19:19  emerson: anyone can help me out, please ...
19:19  themill: diago: your irc client isn't working out where the URL ends properly. File a bug against it... it should do better than that.
19:19  stew: is ; valid in a url?
19:19  diago: ok, cool
19:20  stew: if it is, i wouldn't blame the irc client
19:20  themill: stew: ;\s is a fairly safe bet to leave it off though (it's always going to be imperfect but every other irc client (or terminal app) I've seen does that bit correctly
19:21  Boohemian: diago: yes, i removed that semicolon
19:21  themill: Same way as it copes elegantly with something like: download it from http://debian.org/.
19:21  themill: (the final . doesn't get included in the hotlinked URL in any client I've seen)
19:21  diago: that didn't in mine either
19:22  emerson: I need a resolution 1600x900 but I can't set it up anyone can help me, please
19:22  Boohemian: emerson: xorg.conf
19:22  babilen: emerson: If you use Gnome you can use "Monitors" in gnome-control-center -- For a DE/WM agnostic solution try *randr, see http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
19:23  babilen: emerson: You could also hardcode the resolution in your xorg.conf though
19:24  emerson: babilen: the screen resolution doesn't work man ..
19:24  diago: emerson: what video card?
19:26  Boohemian: babilen: debian makes it easy? that's nice. :)  back in my gentoo days (when i used X11), i had to edit xorg.conf
19:26  Boohemian: it was terrible
19:26  babilen: emerson: What do you mean? Does it sleep on the couch? Please provide more details: Your card (preferrably output of lspci -nn) and a concise description of your problem. Can you change the resolution with xrandr?
19:27  emerson: diago: is a assus motherboard M2N68-AM SE2 and the video is on board.
19:28  emerson: babilen: I can't I tryed with grandr but didn't work....
19:30  babilen: emerson: Ok -- You are running Xorg right now, which works fine except for the fact that it uses the wrong resolution? You tried changing the resolution within gnome-control-center's "Monitor" setting, with grandr and xrandr (as detailed on the wiki) and it did not change the resolution? Is that (more or less) the problem you are facing?
19:31  emerson: babilen: no I'm not ...
19:32  babilen: Feel free to correct me :)
19:32  emerson: babilen: what do I have to type on the terminal so see the right resolution ?
19:32  abrotman: xdpyinfo or xrandr
19:33  diago: emerson: lspci | grep VGA
19:34  abrotman: you migth want a -nn
19:34  babilen: emerson: Please paste the output of "xrandr" , "lspci -nn|grep -i vga" and probably your /var/log/Xorg.0.log to http://paste.debian.net
19:34  emerson: diago: doesn't show ...just tells me that is a nVidia
19:35  emerson: babilen: right what's the past bin url ?
19:35  babilen: emerson: I mentioned it ^^^^
19:35  diago: judd: info jockey
19:35  judd: No record of package 'jockey' in lenny/i386.
19:35  emerson: babilen: yeah sorry ..
19:39  emerson: babilen: paste.debian.net/99567/
19:40  babilen: emerson: make that "lspci -nn|grep -i vga" (note the -i vga)
19:40  abrotman: and the -nn!
19:41  babilen: emerson: So the screen is in 1600 x 1200 (its maximum) but you want that to be 1600 x 900 ?
19:41  babilen: Is that the problem?
19:41  emerson: babilen: right that's what I want actually that was what the monitor told me let's say ..
19:42  babilen: I think the "0" freq is a bit strange
19:42  babilen: emerson: It looks as if that mode is not supported -- what else did you monitor tell you and how did it tell you that?
19:43 * babilen is still waiting for the lspci output and Xorg.0.log 
19:43  stew: Xorg.0.log would contain what you want from lspci anyway :)

19:46  emerson: babilen: my monitor is a sangsung b2030
19:47  babilen: right -- it seems to support a resolution of up to 1600x900 if I can trust samsung's technical specs :)
19:50  ska: Can i turn off 'hal' on a server?
19:50  babilen: emerson: Could you please also paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
19:50  babilen: ska: You can safely remove it, yes
19:51  babilen: ska: Just make sure your name is not "Dave"
19:51  emerson: judd: babilen: it says permission denied ...
19:51  babilen: emerson: judd is a bot, and try it as root
19:52  emerson: babilen: I know was mistake ..
19:53  babilen: It seems as if the EDID information is wrong for that monitor
19:53  emerson: babilen: look that's the chipset: GeForce 7025/nForce 630a(MCP68 SE)
19:54  babilen: emerson: Do you actually have a distorted resolution or do you just *want* it to use 1600x900 (obviously the correct mode)
19:54  emerson: babilen: I'm rootted already ..
19:54  amee2k: is there a way to install emdebian from an optical drive too?
19:55  amee2k: i only see the manual mention USB flash drives and from another hard drive
19:55  emerson: babilen: I just have installed and I can't set up anything..
19:56  amee2k: the "installation media" chapter includes a mildly generic remark about cdrom installation, but there is no information as to where to obtain the installation media from
19:56  babilen: emerson: Could you please paste your Xorg.0.log ... then "aptitude install read-edid" and "get-edid|parse-edid" → http://paste.debian.org
19:57  emerson: babilen: sure I'll do it ..
19:57  babilen: emerson: What do you mean with "can't set up anything" ? You cannot install additional software? The screen is not working and you are accessing the computer with a different method?
