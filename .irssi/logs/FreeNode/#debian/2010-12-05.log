00:26  phorce1: babilen: I was about to type "never mind". I had a '-h' in my du command line that was screwing things up
00:27  babilen: hehe :)
00:27  babilen: Kuifje111: inspircd is available as a Debian package. Just "aptitude install inspircd" to get it. Note that this is *not* a "warez" channel
00:28  Kuifje111: haha
00:31  phorce1: now if I could just get it to leave OUT the directory sizes and only list individual files inside each directory and subdirectory. I'm trying to clean up an old Windows drive with LOTS of subdirectories

00:56  cirwin: hrm

00:59  Jckf: For everything?
01:00  daemonkeeper: Except /root and /tmp, yes.
01:00  Jckf: Interesting
01:00  daemonkeeper: Why? It shouldn't be new to you, that non privileged users have no write permissions on /
01:01  Jckf: No. I just thought it would be more specific for each directory
01:01  daemonkeeper: Those permissions aren't like that for the entire file system, this is not recursive of course
01:02  Jckf: Aha. Let me rephrase
01:02  Jckf: What are the default permissions for erverything in / ?
01:02  Jckf: *everything
01:02  Jckf: Non-recursive
01:03  daemonkeeper: Same again, on the next level things may change.
01:03  Jckf: What about /root and /tmp?
01:04  daemonkeeper: /tmp is writable to everyone, and root accessible by root only.
01:04  Jckf: Of course. Thanks
01:05  bittervoltage: Hello all :)
01:06  bittervoltage: I have spent most of my day searching for something so simple but I just can't find a solution.
01:07  bittervoltage: booting a ubuntu 9.10 install to command line but after 10 mins the monitor shuts off. Checked the BIOS and it's an archaic propriatary HP 4 option BIOS, nothing there about power saving at all
01:08  themill: bittervoltage: you want to stick to #ubuntu for that question
01:08  bittervoltage: thanks themill, already there seem to have fallen on deaf ears
01:09  bittervoltage: I google until my mouse died today, nothing
01:09  bittervoltage: seems like something so simple
01:09  Kamping_Kaiser: you still want #ubuntu for that question
01:09  Bushmills: so what make you stick to ubuntu, if you experience problems nobody can solve?
01:09  phogg: love
01:10  streuner_: lol
01:10  phogg: I stick with Linux even though there are some problems I haven't found solutions for.
01:10  bittervoltage: basically I was following a tutorial on how to setup a minecraft server and it called for 9.10 install so I didn't want to change to many varriables
01:10  phogg: Some have solutions I can't be bothered to research, some probably don't. I love it too much to get scared by little flaws.
01:10  bittervoltage: and I figured etch would be so out of date java would be to old
01:11  bittervoltage: amen to that phogg
01:11  Jckf: Any one here know why Perl is always runnin in taint mode on my box?
01:11  Kamping_Kaiser: ... etch?

01:20  bittervoltage: themill if I remember correctly I think debian also goes into a power save mode after being idle from command line. what would the debain no gui fix me?
01:21  bittervoltage: *fix be sorry
01:22  themill: bittervoltage: this varies from release to release. #ubuntu should know the answer.
01:23  Jckf: daemonkeeper: Still there?
01:24  daemonkeeper: Yes
01:24  Jckf: I think my problem is setuid/setgid being set recursivly on /
01:24  Jckf: How do I remove it?
01:25  daemonkeeper: Depending on actual set flags chmod u-t
01:26  Jckf: I think it was a "chmod ug+s" that was run
01:27  daemonkeeper: Then ug-s is the counter part.
01:27  daemonkeeper: Note, that this will break some things (i.e. programs that _should_ have sticky bits)
01:27  stew: Jckf: so you need a list of all the files on your system that SHOUD have u+s or g+s, then set everything ug-s, then reset the ones that should have it
01:27  Jckf: Yes
01:27  Jckf: How the hell would I know what should have these bits set?
01:27  stew: Jckf: how easy are your backups to access?
01:28  Jckf: :>
01:28  Jckf: Shoot me. No backups
01:29  daemonkeeper: That is a legitimate question. It is way easier to reinstall the whole system, than to recover all permissions. You could just reinstall and copy over your data. Those permissions are probably easy to recover.
01:29  Jckf: Reinstall is out of the question. This is a remote box
01:30  daemonkeeper: If you are sure, that you just have set sticky bits, remove them and do some try & error.
01:30  Jckf: I just did, and everything is back to normal as far as I can tell
01:30  daemonkeeper: At least the most essential things _should_ work, sudo being a notable example.
01:31  Jckf: Oopsie. Apache broke
01:31  Jckf: People are complaining
01:31  daemonkeeper: cgi?
01:31  Jckf: Yes
01:32  daemonkeeper: Then you are using suexec perhaps. That needs sticky bits.

13:49  abrotman: !hold
13:49  dpkg: hmm... hold is a status flag that tells the package manager not to automatically upgrade a package.  To hold a package: 'echo <package> hold|dpkg --set-selections'.  It is also possible to use aptitude: 'aptitude hold <package>'.  Note that the hold flag set using aptitude might be ignored by other package managers (i.e. Update Manager and Synaptic), but aptitude will respect the hold set in the dpkg database.

17:27  bla: Is it possible to install .deb file via aptitude/apt-get so it can pull any requried dependencies?
17:28  daemonkeeper: That is, what both tools are for.
17:28  daemonkeeper: Ah, you mean the .dep directly?
17:28  daemonkeeper: .deb
17:28  pipeline: bla: dpkg -i the deb, if it fails, apt-get -f install
17:28  themill: bla: installing a random .deb is frequently not what you should be doing. repositories exist for a reason.

17:31  dpkg: What Are You Trying To Do, Did You Know That Cows Go Moo?
17:31  bolt: heh. sorry.
17:31  bla: pipeline, thanks
17:31  daemonkeeper: aptitude doesn't moo anymore :/
17:31  bla: themill, I'm packaging something for someone and was wondering what to write in 'install' section of docs
17:32  thewanderer1: daemonkeeper: it's apt-get which has super-cow powers
17:32  daemonkeeper: Yes, that's what I mean.
17:32  daemonkeeper: aptitude doesn't.
17:32  bolt: are those powers documented somewhere?
17:32  thewanderer1: sure, the source :P

17:33  stittel: Hi! I am having a bit of a problem understanding ecryptfs. I am aware that the encryption password for an ecryptfs directory is encrypted with the login password of the user's account. So when I login back in, the login password can be used to decrypt the encryption password, sparing me the need to enter another password.
17:33  themill: bla: "dpkg -i foo.deb; apt-get -f install", or look at gdebi. Or stick it in a repo and point apt at it (sources.list.d/ exists to make this easy for you)
17:34  stittel: However, I am logging in via SSH with an ssh key, no password ever gets passed to PAM or whatever. Still I can use ecryptfs-mount-private to successfully decrypt the encrypted directory without entering a password. And that is scary.
17:35  Rdogg1: hey guys, i cant ssh into my debian, it says "Connection refused", even though i put ALL:ALL in /etc/hosts.allow
17:36  daemonkeeper: Is SSH running? ;)
17:36  Rdogg1: well, if connection refused, i think so
17:36  Rdogg1: other wise timeout, right?
17:36  daemonkeeper: No. Connection refused means "there is no listening port on that host"
17:36  stittel: Rdogg1: No, if nothing is listening on the SSH port, it won't time out.
17:36  daemonkeeper: Timeout means "there is no such host"
17:36  Rdogg1: hmm
17:37  Rdogg1: the thing is Debian doesnt include my gfx card driver
17:37  Rdogg1: so i have to go to systemrescue cd
17:37  Rdogg1: to fix everything
17:37  Rdogg1: (i just installed debian 5 mins ago)
17:37  daemonkeeper: apt-get install openssh-server
17:37  stittel: Rdogg1: Why not just boot into a runlevel that doesn't bring up X?
17:37  Rdogg1: can i type even though no gfx driver?
17:38  Rdogg1: its CLI
17:38  Rdogg1: i didnt install a desktop enviroment
17:38  daemonkeeper: You can, the only requirement is shell access.
17:38  Rdogg1: i guess the kernel needs my gfx driver to display anything
17:38  stittel: Rdogg1: You don't need any GFX driver for accessing just a console without X.
17:38  Rdogg1: uhh wat
17:38  Rdogg1: you sure?
17:38  daemonkeeper: Yes, he's right.
17:39  Rdogg1: how would the graphics card know what to draw to the vga with no driver?
17:39  stittel: Rdogg1: Because your card is VGA (and beyond that VESA) compatible?
17:39  daemonkeeper: There are low level modes, every card supports.
17:39  daemonkeeper: That's essentially the same as your boot screen.
17:39  thewanderer1: stittel: your situation sounds suspicious to me, too...
17:40  Rdogg1: well why no display :O?
17:40  daemonkeeper: Your BIOS has no display driver for your graphic card neither.
17:40  Rdogg1: i see
17:40  thewanderer1: stittel: perhaps it just uses a private key file instead of passing the password? besides, how does the password get passed on your system? via PAM?
17:40  daemonkeeper: (Beyonc VGA/VESA as said)
17:41  stittel: thewanderer1: That's the question, I have no idea how the password gets passed. I needed to enter the login password during creation of the encrypted ecryptfs directory, so it could use this login password to encrypt the mount passwort, which I also specified during creation of the ecryptfs directory.
17:42  Rdogg1: whats the ssh package called in apt?
17:42  stittel: thewanderer1: After that, I never ever entered either the login password (since login happens with SSH key) not the mount password and can still happily mount and umount the encrypted volume withouth getting prompted for a password.
17:42  Rdogg1: openssh-server?
17:43  thewanderer1: stittel: have you rebooted in between?
17:43  daemonkeeper: That's the package providing a SSH server, yes
17:43  thewanderer1: stittel: I don't know about ecryptfs userspace architecture, but it's possible that you have some kind of daemon running and keeping the password in RAM
17:44  stittel: thewanderer1: No. But it shouldn't be required (the manual just says "log out and back in again") and it's a server doing useful stuff, so I don't wanna reboot for fun.
17:44  thewanderer1: I understand. so inspect the process list
17:44  stittel: thewanderer1: Just checked the process list. There is no process younger than 2 hours and I did the ecryptfs stuff just 30 minutes ago.
17:44  daemonkeeper: Or the memory space.
17:45  stittel: thewanderer1: Also everything happens with user rights, i. e. creation and mounting of the encrypted directory did not involve using the root account at all.
17:45  thewanderer1: well, it could be stored in SysV IPC, too, but wouldn't that be a stupid thing for a program to do?
17:46  thewanderer1: `strace ecryptfs-mount-private` and see what it does - you probably want to dump the output somewhere
17:46  stittel: thewanderer1: Actually if the main idea is to get the login password via PAM and use it to decrypt the mount password... why should it store anything password-related anywhere when the volume is not mounted?
17:46  thewanderer1: stittel: I thought that it's what you were wondering :P

17:47  Rdogg1: guys, what is the file with the things it launches at udev ?
17:48  stittel: thewanderer1: Exactly. :)
17:48  stittel: thewanderer1: http://pastebin.com/xNRJdBx0
17:48  thewanderer1: stittel: /usr/bin/ecryptfs-mount-private  is a bash script, you might want to read it :)
17:49 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 947]
17:50  stittel: thewanderer1: Good point. :) And well, it comes down to this: http://pastebin.com/xYxR88sQ
17:51  thewanderer1: "is available in the keyring" definitely means that there is some kind of memory/disk storage of the key
17:51  thewanderer1: in SSH, for instance, there is the ssh-agent, a keyring daemon
17:52  thewanderer1: you could try and `slay` (yes, that's a package) all the user's processes, and then see if it still remembers the password :P
17:52  stittel: thewanderer1:There is stuff in ~/.ecryptfs. One file is wrapped-passphrase, which contains the mount password encrypted with the login password.
17:52  stittel: thewanderer1: The only other file of interest there is Private.sig.
17:52  thewanderer1: stittel: yes, but there has to be something else, like a daemon
17:53  stittel: thewanderer1: Nope, I checked, really. :)
17:54  thewanderer1: well, you should strace the execution of /sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private
17:55  thewanderer1: (also, reading the output before pasting it in public might be a good idea unless you want your password exposed from a 'read' call :P )
17:56  thewanderer1: I really liked LUKS more :P
17:57  thewanderer1: oh, the manpage says "the private mount passphrase is in their kernel keyring". kernel keyring, cool...
17:57  thewanderer1: so you do have to reboot or ask the kernel kindly to remove it
18:00  stittel: thewanderer1: Thanks for your help. I think I'll kinda...forget the idea about ecryptfs.
18:00  thewanderer1: btw. my hostnames are derived from planets and sun, too :P
18:00  stittel: thewanderer1: LUKS has the disadvantage that I can't easily grow images. But since I got enough diskspace, I can probably live with that.
18:01  thewanderer1: well, you could always use loopback files, why not?
18:01  stittel: thewanderer1: I've got the idea from a Linux book I read about a decade ago. I just need to think about something else now, since I am out of planets. :)
18:02  stittel: thewanderer1: With loopback files, I create an image of size x. And if I only need y < x I am wasting x-y of diskspace and if I need z > x, then I need to create a new image, because I can't just enlarge x.
18:02  babilen: stittel: http://namingschemes.com/
18:02  thewanderer1: sure, but you can compress it
18:03  thewanderer1: or even place it in a compressing filesystem, like ZFS or ext*
18:03  stittel: babilen: Thanks. But I'll probably go for Freespace ship names. :)
18:03  babilen: stittel: good choice as wel
18:03  babilen: +l
18:04  stittel: thewanderer1: If LUKS does a good job, volumes will not be very well compressible. I mean, after all the idea of properly encrypted data is that you can't tell it apart from random data.
18:04  thewanderer1: hm, right :P
18:04  thewanderer1: wouldn't that mean that eCryptfs doesn't do a good job? O.o
18:04  stittel: thewanderer1: eCryptFs doesn't encrypted entire block devices (or image files) but just single files on top of the file-system.
18:05  thewanderer1: yes, but it's a file system
18:05  thewanderer1: so you mean it's not supposed to hide file boundaries, ok
18:05  stittel: thewanderer1: It's a layer on top of the file system whilst LUKS is a layer beneath the file-system.
18:07  Rdogg1: hey #debian
18:07  Rdogg1: take a look at this epic glitch

18:07  Rdogg1: look at the pis

18:07  daemonkeeper: Nontheless you can also run LUKS on top of a file system, i.e. as loopback image.
18:08  chrisb: i'm in debian-installer, and i want to download and install extlinux as my bootloader, rather than grub or lilo
18:08  stittel: thewanderer1: The version shipped with Debian actually doesn't even seem to encrypt file names, which is kinda pityful. encfs or this triple-DES based stuff we had in woody could do that.
18:08  chrisb: apt-get doesn't work from the shell, though
18:08  compgenius999: Rdogg1, Input not supported, yet it appears it's printed the text anyway
18:08  Rdogg1: yeah man epic

18:10  chrisb: thewanderer1: no, i'm on tty2, prompt and df shows /target/<mounts>
18:10  chrisb: maybe apt-install is what i need
18:10 * chrisb looks at /bin
18:10  thewanderer1: chrisb: if you want a bootloader on the target, you need to install it on the target, not in the installer...
18:12  Rdogg1: stittel: huh?
18:12  chrisb: thewanderer1: thanks.  how can i download it into the target?  i don't have /bin/apt-get
18:13  thewanderer1: chrisb: chroot into the target and work in there. and for a bootloader, you'll need /dev, /proc and /sys probably.
18:14  chrisb: thewanderer1: so /usr/sbin/chroot /target ?

19:12  amee2k: it squirts out a stack trace and panics less than a second into the boot process
19:13  amee2k: the panic line suggests it dies in acpi_ev_match_prw_and_gpe() and there is lots of other acpi_* stuff in the backtrace

20:12  thewanderer1: you could use UNetBootin
20:13  pfred1: acemi that takes me here http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/lenny/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/ not what i want
20:13  pfred1: been there done that don't work for me
20:14  pfred1: acemi unless those isos above it work?
20:14  pfred1: heck I'm just going to give it a shot what do I have to lose?
20:14  acemi: he says yes
20:15  abrotman: !usb install
20:15  dpkg: Yes, it is possible to install Debian from a USB stick/thumbdrive/pen drive/key, as long as your system's BIOS can boot from USB.  Details are in the Installation Guide, see http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/ch04s03 .  To download USB stick images, ask me about <install debian>.  https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download to prepare from Windows.  BIOS can't boot from USB?  Use http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html
20:15  abrotman: that ?
20:15  C-Otto: hi there
20:15  C-Otto: i have problems getting my system boot from a LVM residing on a raid5 (md)
20:15  C-Otto: how do i need to setup the initrd?
20:16  C-Otto: it seems the lvm modules are not loaded, although i have them listed in the modules config file for initramfs-tools
20:16  pfred1: C-Otto debian has a nice way of doing that with make kpkg or something in the kernel
20:16  pfred1: C-Otto then you just dpkg -i your deb file and it does it all for you!
20:17  C-Otto: i did dpkg-reconfigure kernel-image-foo
20:17  C-Otto: that creates a new initrd
20:17  C-Otto: but that one does not work
20:17  JonSparks: Anyone know why GNUPanel messed up my server so bad that I can no longer install php or apache correctly?
20:18  JonSparks: I followed the exact instructions for install, but it screwed up everything.
20:18  abrotman: JonSparks: use a pastebin to show us the errors

20:20  abrotman: that's not what the USB installatoin instructions say ...
20:20  JonSparks: abrotman: It was yesterday, it removed php and apache and now i can'treinstall
20:20  pfred1: abrotman it should work
20:21  abrotman: JonSparks: use a pastebin to show us the errors
20:21  doxy2: hi
20:21  doxy2: how can i disable lastlogin message when loggin in through ssh?
20:21  doxy2: the options there in /etc/pam.d/login but not in /etc/pam.d/sshd
20:22  thewanderer1: doxy2: have you checked common-session and friends?
20:22  doxy2: sshd does have pam_motd.so but how can i control lastlog in sshd
20:23  doxy2: thewanderer1: yes, common-session has only this line: session required        pam_unix.so
20:23  petemc: doxy2: looked in /etc/pam.d/login ?
20:24  doxy2: petemc: login does have the option to disable lastlog, but i only want to disable it for ssh sessions
20:25  doxy2: which daemon should i restart when i modify files in pam.d?
20:26  doxy2: at least sshd restart was sufficient when i modified the options in pam.d/sshd
20:26  doxy2: but if i modify login, which daemon needs to be restarted
20:26 --- CompWizdr is now known as CompWizrd
20:28  poisonbit: doxy2, did you try starting a new sesion?  maybe you can relaunch:  init q (for tty login prompts) and /etc/init.d/*dm restart (for X, xdm, gdm, kdm, etc)
20:28  dclarke: okay .. status report from those that have seen me work on this over the past week. alsa simple does not work on either lenny or squeeze with SB-XFi - Creative X-Fi Creative X-Fi 20K1 SB073x type audio card. I have build alsa from sources on both lenny and tried on squeeze .. nothing works .. its officially broken with the snd_ctxfi kernel module

21:01  jhutchins_lt: pfred1: You should be able to juggle it with kernel options then.  Did you try rescue mode?
21:01  cousin_mario: hello
21:01  pfred1: jhutchins_lt oh I burnt that box down days ago I'm trying to give it another shot though
21:01 * cousin_mario is about to ask a very unpopular question
21:01  pfred1: jhutchins_lt lets just say the alternatives out there are worse
21:01  cousin_mario: any chance squeeze will be released in january 2011?

21:05  thewanderer1: yes, think about clay tablets
21:05 * dclarke hands a rock and chisel over to pfred1 
21:05  pfred1: thewanderer1 what is scary is we can still read those but can't read floppy disks anymore and they call this progress!
21:06  dclarke: pfred1: why can we not read a floppy ?
21:06  pfred1: dclarke I don't know I think my drives all rusted out here
21:06  pfred1: dclarke all I know is I got a stack of them that do not work today
21:07  dclarke: oh .. hardware failure
21:07  dclarke: floppy drives are a dime a dzen almost anywhere
21:07  dclarke: so it should not be too hard to hook one up

21:07 * dclarke thinks 
21:07  dclarke: no thanks .. the shipping is not worth it
21:09  pfred1: OK so can I install this kernel backport before I reboot from the install? like go to another terminal or something?
21:09  thewanderer1: pfred1: you should have 2 usable terminals in the installer on tty2 and 3
21:10  pfred1: thewanderer1 I know I've IRCed during Debian installs before
21:10 * thewanderer1 was rather thinking along the lines of playing `bastet`, kind of like in Nexenta installer :P
21:10  pfred1: just seems awfully pointless to me to reboot into a failed system like everyone has suggested here
21:11  thewanderer1: once you're in the chroot, just apt-get install it
21:11  thewanderer1: (don't forget about setting up the repo in sources.list and apt-get update)
21:11  pfred1: thewanderer1 why can't I do it before the installer exits?
21:12  thewanderer1: pfred1: well, can't you? :P
21:12  pfred1: it'd save me the chroot hassle
21:12  thewanderer1: well, nothing prevents you from switching to tty2 while the installer is running
21:13  pfred1: well I was sort of thinking at the end of the process right before i reboot it
21:13  bp0: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/607052
21:13  bp0: speaking of not reading floppy
21:13  pfred1: man if i can get Lenny running on that box it'll be hog heaven!
21:13  bp0: sorry to butt in, i was pinged by something about christmas, and then noticed that
21:14  thewanderer1: pfred1: if you already have Lenny on there but can't boot it, you don't have to run the whole installer
21:14  thewanderer1: just run the rescue mode or normal mode and not go through the steps, switching right to tty2
21:15  pfred1: oh this is crap now I can't even get the package name because "Your keyword was too generic." if i knew the name I wouldn't need to search for it now would I?

21:17  pfred1: dclarke Debian's shipped kernel cannot boot my new system so I have determined i need to load a bpo package now i need the name because I'll be flying blind in the install
21:17  thewanderer1: pfred1: look at what judd said
21:17  h3sp4wn_: abrotman: They do but its broken in alot of really obscure ways (the initrd doesn't create stuff like null /dev and /tmp ends up readonly - I have tried hacking around it, problem is for a debian config its taken from the dom0 (kernel and initrd) for fedora / centos / ubuntu it uses pygrub - what about loading the netboot vmlinuz and initrd (via pygrub) can I do that ? any kernel commandline options I need ?
21:17  pfred1: none of those are bpos
21:18  thebloggu: i'm trying to use a sequence like in sequence.nextval in a query using pdo_oci. what is the type i should use when binding it? PDO::PARAM_INPUT_OUTPUT?
21:18  abrotman: h3sp4wn_: never tried to boot the netboot with pygrub .. all i can tell you to do is try it .. but make sure you have some rescue system in place
21:18  dclarke: pfred1: pardon my ignorance .. I hit similar issues sometime when working on powerpc and sparc systems and I have a DEC alpha ( nut that I am ) and sometimes the kernel just needs to be built. So .. can you tell me .. briefly ,, what is your status? Is the machine down ? running .. booting the debian installer or .. what ?

21:41  razieliyo: it says the same error, it breaks at downloading a file
21:42  razieliyo: and I can't install lilo nor grub
21:42  jhutchins_lt: cirwin: You could try running memtest, or just re-seating everything.  Good excuse to dust out the box.
21:42  cirwin: ok :)
21:42  Iridos: Neo|Desktop, http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html?
21:42  Iridos: and it's not really a question for here...
21:42  jhutchins_lt: razieliyo: Which mirror are you using?  What file does it stop at?
21:43  razieliyo: I'm trying to change the mirror, and it does the same
21:43  razieliyo: the squeeze fails at 959 file
21:43  razieliyo: and lenny, don't really know
21:43  Neo|Desktop: Iridos: ah thanks, i'll take a look at that.. much a ppricated
21:43  razieliyo: the entire CD, really doesn't detect my hardware directly
21:43  jelly-home: Neo|Desktop: there's a ##windows channel
21:43  razieliyo: but well, I use to install it by netinst
21:43  razieliyo: but it fails at a file
21:44  razieliyo: I've downloaded it a few times, the netinst
21:44  razieliyo: but still failing
21:44  razieliyo: I'm getting mad
21:44  razieliyo: the problem is just at downloading packages
21:44  razieliyo: I don't know if using LVM is a cause
21:44  acemi: razieliyo: alt+f4 to see the log
21:44  Arrowmaster: can you tell which package?
21:45  razieliyo: nice, I'll see the log, now I can't because I've to install it again, but I'll give you the package error when I try to install it again
21:45  razieliyo: do you think it can be a package problem?
21:45  razieliyo: or a mirror problem?
21:46  jhutchins: razieliyo: Are you sure you have enough disk space?
21:46  babilen: razieliyo: I would try a minimal netinstall (i.e. one in which you don't install *any* tasks)
21:46  jhutchins: razieliyo: Could it be a network problem?
21:46  razieliyo: mmm... can be that, I'm giving usr 10 gb, and root, other 10 gb
21:46  razieliyo: and I don't think it can be a network problem
21:46  razieliyo: because I tried to install  it by other mirrors
21:47  razieliyo: and about the minimal netinstall, I've just tried to install the base and X
21:47  razieliyo: you see, I've noticed one thing
21:47  razieliyo: it says the remaining time always
21:47  razieliyo: but when it gets into 959 file, it just doesn't say it
21:48  razieliyo: I really didn't know I could view the log, I think there will be the problem
21:48  razieliyo: but it's strange, I also thought it was a space problem, but I think that I've given enough space
21:48  razieliyo: what directories use debian for the install?
21:48  razieliyo: so that I could give them more space
21:52  babilen: razieliyo: 10GB for /usr and / should be more than enough. For a detailed overview see http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/amd64/apds02.html.en
21:52  razieliyo: I'm not installing the amd64 version, but I think this will go well
21:52  babilen: razieliyo: But try a *minimal* install and start it from there. You might also want to consider configurin LVM so you can change the size later on
21:53  babilen: razieliyo: The i386 document has the same appendix (haven't checked if the sizes differ)
21:53  razieliyo: babilen, I'll try that, I've configured LVM well I think, then I'll try what you say about a very minimal install
21:54  razieliyo: I've got to take my girlfriend to her home lol
21:54  razieliyo: so I'll try in about an hour
21:54  razieliyo: and I'll get in here
21:54  babilen: razieliyo: Sure, take your time. May you have a nice day!
21:55  razieliyo: babilen, are you going to stay here a long time?
21:55  razieliyo: so that I can tell you the results
21:56  babilen: razieliyo: I might be here, but there are a lot of other people in here as well :)
21:56  razieliyo: yes, you're right =)
21:56  SuperAlekZ: yo :)
21:56  lokyiot: I want to migrate to debian. What should i get 5.0.7 or squeeze?
21:56  SuperAlekZ: need some help with lighttpd
21:57  SuperAlekZ: don't know how to get rid of one annoying senseless 404
21:57  daemonkeeper: lokyiot: For your desktop?
21:58  lokyiot: daemonkeeper:  For my laptop, doing c and c++ development.
21:58  babilen: lokyiot: If so, you can try Squeeze. Don't use it for anything mission critical or for machines that offer services to other
21:58  daemonkeeper: If you do care about recent software versions use squeeze, if you do care about security updates and a rock stable distribution use Lenny
21:58  babilen: lokyiot: I run Squeeze happily on my laptop
21:58  lokyiot: babilen:  no crashes?:)
21:59  daemonkeeper: Squeeze is about to replace Lenny reasonably soon, so you are rather safe to run it.
21:59  jelly-home: daemonkeeper: define reasonably!
21:59  lokyiot: daemonkeeper:  I see, thanks.
21:59  razieliyo: I'm leaving

21:59  babilen: lokyiot: the "stable" in Debian does not refer to the software being less crash-prone, but rather to the fact that the versions do not change
22:00  SuperAlekZ: Hey guys, how can I find out why a certain uploaded page on my webserver shows 404, though it is at this place?
22:00  jelly-home: daemonkeeper: so, probably next year, eh
22:00  babilen: lokyiot: And yes, I am running it without crashes for, well, quit a while
22:00  daemonkeeper: jelly-home: I can remember the Sarge history ... ;)
22:00  babilen: SuperAlekZ: Permissions?
22:00  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: first thing is always inspecting the web server logs
22:01  lokyiot: babilen:  I see. Well I'll go for squeeze then.
22:01  babilen: daemonkeeper: newbie ;)
22:01  SuperAlekZ: babilen what exactly? :S
22:01  SuperAlekZ: jelly-home I did, but the error.log does not show anything :(
22:01  babilen: SuperAlekZ: Is it readable?
22:01  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: and access.log?
22:01  daemonkeeper: babilen: I didn't say Sarge was my first Debian, I said I can remember what "its done when its done means" since Sarge
22:02  babilen: daemonkeeper: Oh, yeah! (I did not meant that negative in any way)

22:03  SuperAlekZ: and babilen  yeah afaik it is :/
22:03  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: and does /forum file exist in your documentroot?
22:03  SuperAlekZ: yep it exists
22:03  SuperAlekZ: babilen it's 0755 so it should be readable
22:03  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: a _file_?
22:03  SuperAlekZ: _file_ ? :S
22:04  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: is it a file or something else?
22:04  jelly-home: (say, a directory)
22:04  SuperAlekZ: forum is a directory
22:04  SuperAlekZ: but there are also files in it, but it's the same with them :/
22:05  zophy: is gmail.com broken ?
22:08  yoshio: SuperAlekZ, try getting "/forum/" (add a trailing slash)
22:08  SuperAlekZ: yoshio same :/
22:08  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: inspect your virtual host and document root settings;  Inspect any rewrite rules you may have in place.
22:09  SuperAlekZ: i did :/
22:09  jelly-home: I don't use lighttpd so I can't make any smarter suggestions
22:09  SuperAlekZ: i can put them on paste.debian.net :/
22:10  jelly-home: there's a #lighttpd channel that may have more clueful people
22:10  kabo69: Hi!
22:11  kabo69: I'm trying to set up a chrooted ssh-account on lenny. But I can't get it to work. I can log in, but I don't seem to be chrooted. pwd displays the full path, not the chrooted path.
22:11  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: your wordpress setup may interfere with any other stuff
22:12  kabo69: anybody think they can help or point me in the right direction to get some help?
22:13  jelly-home: SuperAlekZ: see how your 404 page looks the same even if you type http://holygon.com/whatever
22:15  SuperAlekZ: jelly-home yea i had that on my mind too :/ hm gotta look into #lighttpd
22:15  SuperAlekZ: thanks anyways ;)

22:16  HackeMate: ?

22:17  daemonkeeper: I can't remember its name right now
22:17  HackeMate: so there are no webmasters on linux?
22:18  HackeMate: what they use

22:31  pipeline: cast: yes, there is a crude vi in the base install

22:50  fbs: its just that from time to time i hope ms does something good
22:51  compaq: fbs, why do you run lvm?
22:51  ttiicc: windows 7 is the best thing they have done for years
22:51  fbs: compaq: easy partition resizing
22:51  ttiicc: and office might also be quite good, the rest is just crap!
22:51  fbs: ttiicc: maybe, but they dont support nfs ...
22:52  abrotman: they do, but windows is offtopic here anyway

23:09  amee2k: damn, that was a nasty piece of work
23:10  ragnar_de: amee2k: i did it last night, today too.
23:10  amee2k: did what?
23:10  amee2k: you got laid?
23:11  compaq: amee2k, what was so nasty about it?
23:12  amee2k: hp doesn't just release the flash image and an updater tool
23:12  amee2k: or even a floppyimage
23:13  amee2k: what you download is some awkward "installer" that can create a floppy for you
23:13  amee2k: so you need to install a windows VM, and let it write its stuff to a floppy image
23:14  babilen: floppy? does it work with CDs as well?
23:14  amee2k: until you can make your floppy and update the bios
23:14  babilen: gah, I know now why I am not updating my bios :-\
23:14  compaq: amee2k, hmm, I don't know abou that.  I just download the netinstall or cd1
23:14  amee2k: babilen: how do you make a cdrom from a windows program that is ndesigned to vomit its stuff onto a floppy drive?
23:15  babilen: amee2k: beats me ... point is, that all the floppy drives are in the cellar
23:15  compaq: amee2k, hmm, don't know what you are talking about, you are installing on some new hardware eh, not a typically laptop or desktop
23:15  babilen: compaq: BIOS upgrade of HP box
23:16  amee2k: compaw armada 1700
23:16  amee2k: and apparently HP is doing armada support now
23:16  compaq: oh, isn't that kind of thing OS independent
23:17  amee2k: http://preview.tinyurl.com/344zlv2  <<  thats the update
23:18  amee2k: well, technically updating the bios flash isn't linked to any os in particular, or to any os in general
23:18  amee2k: but manufacturers have a way to making connections where there are none ;)
23:18  amee2k: hench probably why they only provide an upgrade procedure that works on windows... because the box came with that on it according to the sticker
23:19  compaq: Hp is stupid like that
23:19  amee2k: and manufacturers also have a way of going to great lengths to make sure they're not accidentially supporting something they didn't ship
23:20  amee2k: compaq: i'm not exactly sure this kind of misbehaviour is restricted to any company in particular
23:20  compaq: HP pretends to support linux hardware, but then these updates rely on windows, it is so annoying.  maybe you could make a small partition, install windows, do the update and then remove it.  Be a long procedure though
23:21  compaq: amee2k, IBM bios updates aren't like that
23:21  amee2k: in the industry YOU don't upgrade your bios. the industry will upgrade YOUR thoughts

23:22  amee2k: compaq: for a 2 minute job? i don't think so. i downloaded ... errr *cough* installed windows in virtualbox, then let the program vomit its insides on a floppy image
23:25  compaq: amee2k, I had one of those HP IPAQ handhelds, And Installed Linux right away, and went to browse the net, but it required an update, cause everyone these days using some new kind of internet, and to install the update, you need windows, so I had to install windows and then install upate and Linux again.  ANd to do these Linux installs, you need to use zmodem for transfer which take 40mins
