08:33  compaq: pocoyo, oh, thats annoying, but you don't  really need the title bar if the have compiz and a dock menu like avant or cairo, but anyway, you must go into compiz settings and make some window settings changes, and it should work
08:34  pocoyo: compaq: yeah~ thanks. :)

08:54  homie: lo
08:55  TyT: my dear if u have a link of debian gnome intel core nevida .iso DVD
08:55  TyT: Please
08:55  TyT: Give it to me and thanks
08:56  homie: is it sold out ?
08:56  TyT: no
08:56  TyT: link
08:57  compaq: Is there any alternative ways, with the mouse,  to switch between windows instead of using the task bar?    Cause I like how with compiz you can point to the top right corner.
08:57  TyT: mirror
08:57  Larcen_: hi all
08:57  TyT: hi
08:57  compaq: Squeeze will be stable soon, ooooooh yeaah
08:58  homie: february ?
08:58  Bop: will be stable ?
08:58  hektik: !mailserver
08:58  Bop: how come
08:58  compaq: Anyone can help me with apache2 and php5.  I installed them fine. but when I point to a php file in /var/www it offers to save or open with, instead of showing it in the browser window
08:58  TyT: if u have a mirror of the better virsion of debian give it to me (intel core - Nevida ) :)
08:59  TyT: install it with the shell
08:59  compaq: Soon there will be Debian cuts, so we can install stablish versions of testing
08:59  Bop: TyT, just search on debian page for the isos
09:00  homie: i got the sources of ati, and the dkms tool, but it seems it's buggy
09:00  vtts: what is
09:00  TyT: but its for CD
09:00  vtts: what is "nevida" ?
09:00  homie: nvidia
09:00  TyT: i want it DVD
09:00  Bop: there are iso files there
09:00  Bop: CD and DVD
09:00  homie: the driver searches for amd things somehow
09:00  TyT: Nevida is the screen card
09:01  Bop: nvidia
09:01  TyT: yeah
09:01  Bop: u dont need dvd
09:01  homie: nevida nevida, we dont's have nevida
09:01  Bop: install cd , then install what u want over the network
09:01  homie: lol
09:01  TyT: i don't have a CD's
09:01  TyT: CDS
09:01  TyT: i have a DVD
09:02  Bop: burn in
09:02  vtts: TyT, http://cdn.debian.net/debian-cd/5.0.6/i386/

09:03  TyT: opject not found !
09:03  TyT: object
09:03  homie: jep dead link
09:03  homie: confirmed
09:04  vtts: it should automagicaly redirect you to a closest mirror
09:04  vtts: TyT, then choose one closest to you from this list: http://www.debian.org/mirror/list
09:04  TyT: if i download the CD version i have to use many cd or dvd
09:04  compaq: yep, haha, a reboot was all I needed to get php running with apache
09:07  vtts: TyT, all you need is a network connection and a small netinst cd (~200MB), everything else can be downloaded from a mirror during install. Unless you don't have a connection, there is no need to waste cd/dvd's. More information is available here: http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/

09:10  shadees: how to start packaging for the community? plz suggest...
09:11  homie: give a call to the kernel!
09:12  TyT: is this the place of the iso ftp://debian.usthb.dz/debian/
09:12  shadees: homie: sorry?? how can i use kernel for this?
09:13  homie: shadees: forget it, it was just a joke!
09:13  shadees: homie: lolz...
09:14  homie: well, i don't think you can package anything unless you want to distribute unofficial packages via p2p or so...
09:15  homie: only the qa team and developers do that i think...when approved or so
09:16  themill: !mentors
09:16  dpkg: rumour has it, mentors is the system the Debian project uses to train new people to become Debian Developers or Debian Maintainers and get their packages into the Debian archive.

09:18  homie: and a page explaining howto become one
09:18  homie: how and when your software piece is conforming ...etc...
09:19  shadees: homie: ok.. but can u tel me the difference between packaging for kde or ubuntu?
09:19  unseensoul: Hi
09:20  shadees: homie: is it done separately(KDE or ubuntu) or both under debian?
09:21  homie: kde is i think mostly packaging via tar.gz or tar.bz and ubuntu with .deb too, but don't ask me what the diff between ubuntu and debian is  i simply don't know
09:21  homie: there are differences in libraries put in i think
09:21  iaj: lo there.. how can I find out which / and how many users are connected over ssh?
09:22  unseensoul: Has anyone been experiencing problems with Abiword (testing)?
09:22  shadees: homie: ;)... can u plz suggest me the channel for asking all my queries..?

09:28  unseensoul: "The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required: ..." ; How can I remove this warning and clear the autoremove list?
09:28  homie: by just pretending to install the same packages in that list
09:29  homie: apt-get install listofpacakges.....
09:29  homie: since they are installed nothing will be installed but the packages will be marked as manually installed or so...
09:30  unseensoul: homie, thanks :)
09:30  unseensoul: homie, by the way, what word processor would you recommend?
09:31  homie: ??
09:31  homie: erm, i think on debian i would use openoffice
09:32  ali3n0: hi guys, I can't remember the name for a handy tool I used once to copy files and get statistics on the fly... anyone?
09:32  unseensoul: homie, thanks again
09:33  homie: there are other packages too, but say koffice stuff is only in kde or so, somone using gnome won't want them or so
09:34  iaj: is there any way to find out whose connected to a certain server via ssh?
09:34  homie: and besides, the ooffice stuff is next to word
09:35  CutMeOwnThroat: and that's good, eh?
09:35  homie: so it is already familiar to those switching from windows maybe

10:34 --- juergen_dose is now known as car
10:34  gnude: now i want wo filter for spam and virus mails. i installes amavisd-new, clamav and spamassisins.
10:34  gnude: but can not configure it right.
10:35  gnude: in the first step he moved all mails with spam and viruses into the quarantäne mailbox.
10:35  gnude: but i want them send to a specal mail account.
10:35  CutMeOwnThroat: I dunno... sounds like a good  way to introduce a lot of future segfaults and other problems in potentially pretty much every program that uses/parses jpeg
10:35  gnude: i editiet the 15-debian-defaults file from amavist and addes $spam_admin and $virus_admin but ... without effect. it seems that he dont use that file
10:36  CutMeOwnThroat: tarzeau, why don't you install it in /usr/local and write wrappers setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH for a couple of programs you want to test it with...
10:38  tarzeau: CutMeOwnThroat: because i want it on 200 machines, not just one
10:40  CutMeOwnThroat: well, then make a package... somewhat sounds to me like you're in a hurry to break a lot of machines quickly, though
10:43  syslq: Which debian is good for desktop? Stable is just too outdated so I have testing and unstable left?
10:44  CutMeOwnThroat: nothing wrong with stable... there's backports for the few things you usually want to have newer
10:44  syslq: CutMeOwnThroat: and stable is stable after all :)
10:44  CutMeOwnThroat: don't run unstable, it's only meant for developers and people who enjoy fixing bugs so much they don't mind things breaking all the time
10:45  syslq: I dont :)
10:45  CutMeOwnThroat: if you have newer hardware that the kernel in stable doesn't support, there's the unofficial kmuto installers which have a newer kernel on the installer cd...
10:46  CutMeOwnThroat: that said, squeeze is frozen right now... so installing it and reporting a few bugs will help making the next stable more bugfree
10:47  syslq: CutMeOwnThroat: I'll try that thanks

10:49  compaq: I think I am under attack maybe
10:49  compaq: I've never ever heard of famd until now, it is running 95% of my cpu
10:49  homie: famd is a daemon i tell you
10:49  homie: kill it , kill it kill it kill it
10:49  homie: lol
10:50  compaq: homie, check out off-topic channel
10:50  syslq: CutMeOwnThroat: ah, squeeze is testing which means more stable packages but less security updates from what I see
10:50  homie: oh man, it's just a daemon for file alteration
10:50  Bouki: hi, is it possible to boot a debian with autologin to root (without prompting password or username) ?
10:50  homie: file alteration monitor daemon
10:50  homie: famd
10:50  CutMeOwnThroat: syslq, also, because squeeze is frozen for some months it'll already have less bugs than testing usually has...
10:51  compaq: well, I killed famd
10:51  syslq: CutMeOwnThroat: otherwise testing is good for desktop or not?
10:51  CutMeOwnThroat: murderer... officer, arrest him!
10:51  homie: it is checking if and which files are altered and when and stores the statistics maybe along with the changes itself somewhere
10:51  RenatoSilva: I've sent an email to a debian bug yesterday and it's not there yet, why?
10:52  CutMeOwnThroat: syslq, right now lenny = stable, squeeze = testing - and sid is always unstable ... when all release-critical bugs are gone from squeeze, it will be released as stable and wheezy will become testing
10:52  TyT: fix ur bug with ur self
10:53  TyT: O:-)
10:53  homie: bug yourself shorter
10:53  Bouki: hi, is it possible to boot a debian with autologin to root (without prompting password or username) ?
10:53  homie: lol
10:53  CutMeOwnThroat: syslq, testing just means that a package has spent 1-2 weeks in unstable without anyone reporting a bug that would prevent it from entering testing...
10:54  CutMeOwnThroat: RenatoSilva, it's not fast, but I usually get confirmation within a day... perhaps wait another day, then resend?
10:55  homie: on and by itself many packages or software run flawlessly
10:55  homie: but but...
10:55  CutMeOwnThroat: Bouki, everything is possible...
10:55  CutMeOwnThroat: it's only software
10:56  RenatoSilva: CutMeOwnThroat: it takes one entire day in average for showing there?
10:56  RenatoSilva: CutMeOwnThroat: is it manually verified by a human being?
10:57  CutMeOwnThroat: RenatoSilva, dunno how long exactly... but I'm usually sending via spamgourmet which can add a huge extra-delay, so I really don't know
10:57  CutMeOwnThroat: RenatoSilva, not that I know of
10:57  CutMeOwnThroat: can't imagine that :)
10:57  RenatoSilva: ok
10:57  Bouki: is there a config file to modify to do this CutMeOwnThroat ?
10:58  CutMeOwnThroat: so for me it's often a couple of hours until I get the reply... but that might be from spamgourmet...
10:58  CutMeOwnThroat: RenatoSilva, I hate the way the bts publishes your email in plain... as I use spamgourmet addresses, I see exactly how much spam goes to the emails in the bugreports

11:05  Bouki: CutMeOwnThroat do you know if gdm works in console mode ?
11:06  CutMeOwnThroat: of course not
11:07  Bouki: so how i make autologin if i can't use gdm
11:07  CutMeOwnThroat: you didn't say you couldn't use gdm
11:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 881]
11:11  CutMeOwnThroat: for the console look at /etc/inittab, read "man getty", specially the bit about -l
11:11  Bouki: ok thanks
11:11  RenatoSilva: CutMeOwnThroat: ok
11:11  CutMeOwnThroat: but probably there's problems just using the shell as "login program"
11:12  CutMeOwnThroat: but google is your friend there... if you use getty+autologin as keywords
11:12  CutMeOwnThroat: or somesuch...
11:12  CutMeOwnThroat: but really, I don't see much of a point in doing this
11:13  CutMeOwnThroat: you can leave the password empty if security is no concern
11:15  jelly: Bouki: what is your use case?
11:15  Bouki: the pc is physically inaccessible, so there is no security concern

11:21  homie: hmmm, and my emacs bar seems to be showing a scrollable window with *scratch*, that was not the case before
11:21  simonrvn: homie: that's something new i didn't see until a few days ago, otherwise i would've reported it. dunno what's triggering it for me, but after a session restart it works ok (krunner, plasma-desktop).
11:22  simonrvn: homie: i think it might have something to do with dbus.

11:32  iaj: ecolitan: ohh sorry.. well I just tried 'useradd foo' and then passwd foo and logged in.. but... i didn't have a home directory there :)
11:33  compaq: when I start mplayer I get segmentation fault.  And I guess it has to do with one or more of the libraries it uses
11:33  ecolitan: iaj: then you'll need to create a homedir
11:34  homie: well, it seems kaffeine's xine uses codecs from mplayer too
11:34  compaq: I wish it would just create the directory when you create the user, along with whatever else needs to be done, like adding to groups and permissions, cause I have no idea about any of that stuff

12:15  eviltoaster: How do i measure trunk speed? does balance-rr give me 4gb or only 1gb but load balancing?
12:17  dekar_: how do I remount my root read-only via ssh?
12:17  dekar_: when I changed the fstab to mount the fs ro the boot locked up when reaching rsync
12:18  dekar_: *rsyslog
12:18  vtts: dekar_, mount -o remount,rw /
12:18  dekar_: it's busy
12:19  dekar_: that was the first thing I tried
12:19  Dewi: dekar_: are you trying to do an interactive fsck?
12:20  Dewi: dekar_: maybe you need to drop into a lower runlevel first (but somehow keep ssh alive)
12:20  dekar_: so disable the kill script in /etc/rc.1?
12:20  Dewi: I don't think the kill script will kill existing sessions anyway
12:20  Dewi: I don't really have good advice for you, it's just an idea
12:20  dekar_: it did!
12:21  dekar_: killed my ssh session when I tried
12:22  Dewi: sorry. yeah I dunno
12:22  Dewi: I would hook up a keyboard & monitor
12:22  Dewi: or ipkvm if remote
12:22  Dewi: (or get somebody remote to do it)
12:24  dekar_: I just wanna to know how to do it without
12:24  dekar_: I could do it with - but don't wanna XD
12:25  vtts: dekar_, try stopping as much process as you can
12:25  Dewi: dekar_: are you using lvm?
12:26  Dewi: dekar_: maybe you could fsck a writeable snapshot and then promote it...
12:27  dekar_: no lvm
12:28  dekar_: just some vm we use for logging in the company - I have to repartition it cause it runs out of space
12:28  Dewi: dekar_: I don't really know this stuff, but at a guess maybe you could run sshd out of the boot ramdisk or something
12:28  Dewi: dekar_: if it's a VM you can definitely just remote to the console
12:29  Dewi: or plug in a virtual \serial terminal
12:29  dekar_: I can ofc
12:29  dekar_: I just wanted to know how to do it
12:29  dekar_: it's called learning
12:29  dekar_: in case I need it one day
12:30  dekar_: I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible to remount / while keeping ssh
12:30  dekar_: it still killed my ssh btw
12:30  dekar_: even though I removed the kill ssh script
12:30  dekar_: init 1 won't work
12:31  dekar_: I hope my shutdown -r 5 will work
12:31  dekar_: but I guess it got killed as well
12:32  vtts: dekar_, have you tried leaving sshd only and stoping other processes?
12:32  dekar_: not yet
12:32  dekar_: can't ssh atm
12:33  dekar_: dunno if it'll reboot
12:35  Dewi: dekar_: I don't really understand why you need it to be interactive?
12:35  dekar_: how would you do it?
12:36  Dewi: dekar_: shutdown -F
12:36  dekar_: fsck? why?
12:36  dekar_: I want to repartition
12:37  vtts: dekar_, repartition running system?
12:37  Dewi: dekar_: I don't understand how you would secure such a system
12:38  dekar_: yeah repartition a running system
12:38  dekar_: while read only mounted
12:39  Dewi: did you try forcing remount?
12:40  Dewi: dekar_: but how can you repartition a read-only filesystem?
12:40  Dewi: dekar_: that doesn't make much sense to me
12:40  vtts: dekar_, it wont work
12:40  dekar_: why?
12:40  dekar_: I want to grow it
12:40  Dewi: dekar_: because it's not read-only, it's unreadable
12:40  Dewi: dekar_: you can't read it while it's growing, you would need LVM for that
12:40  dekar_: Dewi, why wouldn't growing of a ro fs work?
12:40  dekar_: I don't get what you imply
12:41  Dewi: dekar_: because while it's growing it would not be readable
12:41  dekar_: I am root - I can write to /dev/sda1
12:41  Dewi: it would not be a coherent FS
12:41  dekar_: I could remount
12:41  Dewi: it would be half small size and half big size
12:41  Dewi: no, you can't remount random bytes
12:41  dekar_: I can remount once it's donw
12:41  dekar_: *done
12:41  Dewi: yes, but in the interim, it's unmounted, not read-only
12:42  Dewi: so all your tools need to be 100% in RAM
12:42  Dewi: I don't know how you can guarantee that without a boot CD or special boot ramdisk
12:43  Dewi: but anyway, I'm no expert
12:43  Dewi: far from it
12:44  Dewi: I have made a debian liveCD with ssh before tho
12:44  dekar_: I got the ram assumption - but I guess it would work
12:44  dekar_: know the risks
12:44  dekar_: still wanna try
12:45  vtts: dekar_, what fs are you using?
12:45  dekar_: ext3 I think
12:46 --- kish is now known as nothingworks
12:46  Dewi: dekar_: probably the sanest hardware-free approach will involve a custom initrd with an sshd
12:46  Dewi: dekar_: but remember, security will be a pain
12:47  Dewi: (because you cannot easily change the access details; you'd have to rebuild the initrd)
12:47  dekar_: so my system just ignores the remount now
12:47  vtts: dekar_, you cannot resize ext3 while it is active
12:47  dekar_: shut everything besides ssh down
12:47  dekar_: no error
12:47  dekar_: vtts, so I'll resize ext2 I guess? :P
12:47  vtts: its the same
12:48  dekar_: no waii :P
12:48  vtts: ext3=ext2+journals
12:48  dekar_: why does it ignore my remount?
12:48  vtts: the basic structure is the same
12:48  dekar_: vtts, yeah man I know that
12:48  vtts: well ok, try it
12:48  dekar_: that's why I said I'd resize ext2 then - was implying they're the same :P
12:49  jelly: vtts: you _can_ grow ext3 while it's active, using resize2fs tool.
12:49  dekar_: so how do I mount ro then?
12:49  dekar_: no error - just ignores me
12:49  jelly: vtts: only shrinking must be done offline
12:49  dekar_: nothing besides ssh and bash running
12:49  Dewi: jelly: oh.
12:49  dekar_: /dev/sda1 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)
12:50  Dewi: sorry dekar_, didn't realize ext3 could grow online
12:50  Dewi: dekar_: you don't need to remount by the looks of things
12:50  dekar_: oh it IS ro
12:50  Dewi: dekar_: just do it
12:50  dekar_: just doesn't tell me
12:50  stew: no, its rw
12:50  dekar_: it IS ro
12:50  jelly: dekar_: /proc/mounts will tell you the truth
12:50  dekar_: can't write
12:50  dekar_: mkdir: cannot create directory `test': Read-only file system
12:50  dekar_: anyway brb
12:50  Dewi: dekar_: either way, just resize it. it doesn't matter.
12:51  jelly: howEVER, resizing the block device below can be problematic if one is using DOS MBR and partitions

14:21  vtts: what command did you use?
14:22  delby: i mounted it through command line but tried to open it by double clicking in gnome.
14:22  vtts: navigate to the directory you mounted it to
14:23  vtts: and not the file itself

14:28  vtts: bartzy, "dpkg --contents file.deb" or "dpkg --extract file.deb dir"
14:28  delby: vtts: i see directories, one of them is 'live' where the file system of the live system is in a squashfs file.
14:29  bartzy: vtts: What if I don't have the deb file ? Just want to check it from the repo without downloading ?
14:29  vtts: delby, try the same mount -o loop ... again
14:30  delby: vtts: for the whole iso or the internal directory that contains the file?
14:32  vtts: bartzy, if you are interested only in the list of files, you could try http://packages.debian.org/
14:33  vtts: delby, -o loop is for mounting a file which contains a file system
14:35  delby: vtts: ok. i mounted the whole iso. will mount the file now.
