00:01  planet8: I'm using gscan2pdf to scan some documents into pdf. I have added the normal user to the scanner group and changed the root.root to root.scanner of gscan2pdf. When I scan as user I get empty documents, but when I scan as root it works. What's missing?
00:04  planet8: okay.. I have just tried, as a test, to add the normal user to all groups, but still gets empty documents. Why can only root access the scanner right?
00:08  jetscreamer: isn't there a scanner group? i forget
00:08  Iridos: there's one for saned
00:08  planet8: yes, and the user is added and the gscan2pdf group is set to the scanner group
00:08  planet8: yes, user is also added the saned group
00:08  jetscreamer: probably 'worng' way but change the perm on the device comes to mind

00:09  planet8: jetscreamer, like 777?
00:09  jetscreamer: nah
00:09  jetscreamer: that would be 'wrong'
00:09  jetscreamer: or Wrong
00:09  planet8: jetscreamer, yes :) but what where you thinking?
00:10  jetscreamer: !sane

00:11  jetscreamer: i cut a lot of corners
00:12  planet8: np.. testing
00:14  planet8: still the same result.. don't get this.. currently I have to su to root and scan, save, then change the user rights on the saved file from root to user.. annoying.
00:15  jetscreamer: read those links the bot spammed maybe... dunno don't do scanners
00:15  jetscreamer: or try #sane
00:15  planet8: I suspect this maybe isn't related to sane, gscan2pdf or user groups, but perhaps something usb.
00:19  jhutchins_lt: I just installed xsane and scanned to PDF files.
00:19  jhutchins_lt: Didn't have to monkey with permissions or anything.
00:20  planet8: yes, I can do that to. It's not xsane that's the problem. gscan2pdf is.
00:20  planet8: but thanks anyway :)

12:47  dpkg: [source package] a set of files used to make a Debian binary <package>.

12:49 --- Channel #debian was synced in 148 seconds
12:49  babilen: kerframil: You basically just need a "deb-src" line for every "deb" line in your sources.list and can do something like "apt-get source PKG" or "dget PKG" (if you have devscripts installed) to get hold of Debian's source package
12:49  babilen: Dazug: Looks like it. I can offer help with wmii, xmonad, awesomewn, fluxbox, but *not* scrotwm

13:11  fi9o: Sorry for my english ;)
13:11  abrotman: fi9o: probably after the release of squeeze

14:17  cr33: i've installed debian 64 bit testing on my laptop and i can't connect to the Internet using wifi card.
14:17  cr33: what do i do in order to fix this problem?
14:17  abrotman: which wifi card?
14:18  cr33: mine :D
14:18  cr33: ehm
14:18  cr33: abrotman, 10:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g (rev 01)
14:18  cr33: something like this
14:18  abrotman: !tell cr33 about bcm4312
14:18  abrotman: you'll need a wired connectoin to get that working .. or a usb drive and a fair amonut of patience
14:19  cr33: usb drive
14:19  cr33: i don't have any spare cable
14:19  abrotman: spare? you only need it for like five minutes
14:19  cr33: i mean i don't have any cable : P
14:20  cr33: can i download the packages from other OS or something?
14:20  abrotman: sure .. the tricky part is actually that the package downloads the firmware and extracts it
14:22  abrotman: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=586441 .. kind of gives you a few hints how to do it manually
14:22  f8l: cr33: Try to install it on a connected computer, and then find the file (probably somewhere in /var/cache), copy it to the same place on target PC and then install the package. May work.
14:23  abrotman: assuming he has another debian computer ?
14:23  f8l: cr33: And by the file I mean the firmware, not the package, though you will need the package too.
14:23  cr33: i've got 32bit slackware installed
14:24  f8l: abrotman: Then one of us could do it, but not me. I'm going to eat breakfast now. I can help when I'm done. ;-)
14:24  cr33: is there any difference between 32bit and 64bit firmware? :P
14:24  abrotman: cr33: nope
14:24  abrotman: cr33: that bug i pasted above shows how to do it manually .. it's not that hard
14:25  abrotman: cr33: i just had to do this a couple of weeks ago for a mac .. kind of the same situation
14:25  cr33: ok i'll try
14:26  abrotman: if you really cannot figure it out .. i could get it for you i'm sure
14:28  cr33: um, will that work if i just copy the files from /lib/firmware/b43 on my slackware partition to the same dir on debian partition? :P
14:29 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 919]
14:29  cr33: assuming these files are the "firmware"
14:29  abrotman: likely, you can try it
14:30  masterkorp: hello
14:33  cr33: i don't really understand what i'm doing
14:35  abrotman: cr33: whihc part of it ?
14:36  cr33: i mean, i think i've used this tool on slackware, because i've had the same problem
14:36  cr33: so these files in /lib/firmware/b43 should be ok?
14:37  cr33: but then how do i use it
14:38  abrotman: use the firmware? you don't really .. you either reboot or unload/reload the module
14:38  masterkorp: cr33: welcome to the real world, where no one knows what the hell they are doing :)
14:38  cr33: ok
14:38  cr33: :D
14:38  cr33: masterkorp,  :D
14:39  cr33: also, the prefix in on that bug page is /lib/firmware, so some files outside b43 dir might be needed :P
14:39  cr33: so maybe i should copy whole /lib/firmware dir? :p
14:39  abrotman: cr33: the prefix is .. because the tool then creates a subdir
14:40  cr33: ok, i'll reboot and check if it works : P
14:55  cridlandr: Hello everyone
14:56  cridlandr: I'm trying to install Debian on a Sparc Blade
14:56  cridlandr: I'm using Netboot
14:56  cridlandr: and this is working ok
14:56  babilen: great
14:56  cridlandr: It partitions the disc correctly
14:56  babilen: !enter
14:56  dpkg: The enter key is not a substitute for punctuation.  Hitting enter unnecessarily makes it difficult to follow what you are saying.  Consider using ',', '. ', ';', '...', '---', or ':' instead.  If you hit enter too often, you will be autokicked by debhelper for flooding the channel.
14:57  cridlandr: Sorry.  As a professional proof-reader I should know better.
14:58  babilen: hehe :)
14:58  abrotman: and a total lack of punctuation!
15:00  cridlandr: The installation partitions the disc correctly and then goes on to download 800 odd files for the operating system.  It manages to download all the files, but then hangs (i.e. it says 802/802 files loaded and stops).  Would anyone be so kind as to know what may be wrong?  Many thanks in advance. abrotman, you must not start a sentence with "and" hehe :)
15:00  jelly-hme: tl;dr
15:00 * jelly-hme hides
15:04  babilen: cridlandr: No error on one of the other consoles?
15:05  cridlandr: babilen: I'm sorry, this is not my forte.  What do you mean by "other consoles"?
15:06  babilen: cridlandr: Try ALT-F2 (F3....)
15:07  babilen: was that "ALT-F4"?
15:08  abrotman: criwhere'd he go ?
15:08  cridlandr: babilen: When I use Alt-F2, it just drops to the command line.
15:09  abrotman: cridlandr: which version of Debian are you installing ?
15:09  abrotman: wtf
15:11  cridlandr: babilen: Does your comment imply there are further consoles, like Alt-F3, Alt-F4 etc...?  If so, I was unaware of this.  And I'm using the <enter> key again.  AND I'm starting sentences with AND again.... gee.
15:11  abrotman: cridlandr: which version of Debian are you installing ?
15:12  abrotman: so if you talk to him .. his connection gets reset? this could be interesting
15:15  babilen: haha, wonderful :)
15:19  jelly-hme: abrotman: that's because he's using sparc.

15:33  negge: just noticed someone tried to login as "bin" over SSH, is it wise to deny that user access completely or is it needed for something?

15:37  complete: Good Morning Debian! May the sun shine on your happy faces all day! Im using sshfs, losetup and cryptsetup to mount encrypted partitions over the net. (as described here: www.vidarholen.net/contents/blog/?p=8). But sometimes the connection goes away in a way, that every command executed on the partition (like ls or whatever) stalls forever and all I can do is reboot. Any ideas how to make this more stable?
15:39  jelly-hme: complete: I don't find sshfs stable enough to be considered as a backend protocol to carry the data for my block devices
15:40 --- juergen_dose is now known as car
15:40  complete: jelly-hme: what other way could a "mount over the net" be achieved?
15:41  jelly-hme: complete: nfs? nbd? -- assuming a secure channel
15:42  jelly-hme: complete: I didn't investigate openvpn as a replacement secure channel; but sshfs definitely breaks when the ssh connection is hung
15:42  cr3: o hai
15:42  cr3: i t seems it worked
15:45  complete: jelly-hme: well, what do you mean with "assuming a securre channel"?
15:45  complete: I could mount an nfs partition over the net, and then locally mount it with cryptsetup. Do you think thats more stable then the sshfs way?
15:46  jelly-hme: complete: neither nfs v3 or nbd are safe over a public network
15:46  CestSebastian: hi, do you know a good tutorial for installing lamp(php) on a development server?
15:46  jelly-hme: complete: so you'd need a secure tunnel for that traffic
15:47  jtmoney: Can someone explain why I need to configure either a CD-ROM or network source if I'm installing from a USB drive?  This netbook has no CD-ROM drive, and I cannot seem to properly install the drivers for the network card either.  Why should any be needed anyway?  All the data that gets installed is on the USB drive already!
15:47  themill: dpkg: tell CestSebastian about lamp
15:47  complete: jelly-hme: i go another way: i use an insecure channel, but mount the partition locally with cryptsetup. so only encrypted data goes over the net.

16:07  do0ob: themill: if a package has an error it will still remain on the system right? if i can do an md5sum on a package with an error and compare it with another copy i might be closer to finding out what happened
16:08  themill: do0ob: the .deb would probably be left in /var/cache, yes. You could compare that with wget-ing the package on some other machine.

16:30  jtmoney: Okay... If I download debian-507-i386-xfce+lxde-CD-1.iso, WHY is it asking me to configure my network card before installing?  I did NOT download the "netinst" variant.
16:30  Hellz_Bellz: i have it installed but grub .... doesnt list it
16:30  jtmoney: Why can't it just copy everything off the USB drive?
16:31  jtmoney: Why does it need to make an interwebz connection first?
16:31  jelly-hme: jtmoney: it will copy everything off the drive.
16:31  jtmoney: jelly-hme, not for me.  It makes me configure my CD-ROM, network card, etc. (both fail) and then I can only abort the installation.
16:31  themill: jtmoney: the installer wants to check if there are any updates released since the iso was made.
16:32  jtmoney: Ohh.
16:32  jtmoney: Well, that's an issue because neither of my NICs are working under Debian.
16:33  themill: that shouldn't prevent the installation from continuing
16:33  jtmoney: It most certainly does.  Let me try again once unetbootin is does and I'll type what the screen says.
16:33  jtmoney: s/does/done
16:34  jtmoney: Is there anywhere I can place the drivers on the USB drive so it enables my NICs?

I made port forwarding for email on smtp port 25. now I want to send a test email. what should I tell the exim4-config?  internet site; mail is sent and received directly using SMTP |OR| mail sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail?
18:41  superlinux: I myself think it must be the 1st option.
18:42  jelly-home: superlinux: which domain are you configuring to receive mail for?
18:42  jownez_: if mail.superlinux.net points to your router and you want to receive mail behind it, yes
18:43  stew: superlinux: does your isp allow you to make port 25 connections in both directions?
18:43  superlinux: jownez_, yes! what you are saying, it's pointing to my router

18:46  stew: and provided that your isp allows port 25 connections
18:46  jhutchins_lt: stew: well, you can use ssmtp for smarthosts too.

19:07  dimitrios2008: babilen: Thanks. Yes, I am using GNOME.
19:07  babilen: I am not entirely sure if that lets you change layouts with ALT-SHIFT, but it might just do that. (I am not using GNOME)
19:09  dimitrios2008: babilen: I am not bothered too much about the alt+shift key combination. If the functionality is there I am more than happy to use it.
19:10  babilen: dimitrios2008: I would just configure additional layouts in the control-center then. I would be surprised if you can't switch between them with some key-combo as well, but I don't know that right now.
19:11  dimitrios2008: babilen: Where is the control-centre? I had a look at the system drop down menus but it's not there.

19:21  babilen: dimitrios2008: You should have the layout indicator in the top panel (something like "USA" now) could you click on it and try if that changes the layout? You might also want to change the hotkey for switching between layouts to ALT-SHIFT if you are more comfortable with it. I would also select the other layout as default to try if it is working at all. :)

20:15  jhutchins_lt: SPF: Right, which is why you're pro-active and preempt the check by doing it manualy.
20:15  nsadmin: not "debian ignores", be specific. what is reading fstab and ignoring the order?
20:15  Walex: SPF: that is because the elevator/flusher settings are not set by default that well.

20:19  nsadmin: which is the way it should be
20:20  abrotman: bitf: oh, you changed it ?
20:20  abrotman: bitf: ah okay, i see
20:21  bitf: abrotman: no and anonymous editor did on the 28th November
20:22  nsadmin: anonymous editor?! I hate that guy, his writing is so generic...
20:22  lenswipe: nsadmin, in soviet russia, you edit anonymous
20:23  lenswipe: or rather, text edits anonymous
20:23  bitf: you could call him 75.173.195.28 from Colorado Springs
20:25  Iridos: well, and according to the reference, which is not a real reference, because it's only the debian  wiki, which can also pretty much be edited by anyone, it's not so clear
20:26  Iridos: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ArtisticLicense is probably the authorativeish bit, and it's not really the same as saying "FSF considers it non-free"
20:33  joe: Hi is there anyone available for help?
20:33  roe: maybe
20:33  bitf: just ask
20:33  roe: !ask
20:33  dpkg: If you have a question, just ask! For example: "I have a problem with ___; I'm running Debian version ___. When I try to do ___ I get the following output ___. I expected it to do ___." Don't ask if you can ask, if anyone uses it, or pick one person to ask. We're all volunteers; make it easy for us to help you. If you don't get an answer try a few hours later or on debian-user@lists.debian.org. See <smart questions><errors>.
20:34  nsadmin: if you don't ask, no one will know if they can help you. also be a sicco:
20:34  nsadmin: !sicco
20:34  dpkg: Please ask sicco questions, questions that are Specific, Informative, Concise, Complete, and On-topic.  Ask me about <research> and <cooperation in asking for help>.
20:37  joe: Hope it's right place. I've booked VPS which is unix based. Loaded Ubuntu karmic on it. Finally to continue I need to run as root user, but it seems that shell doesn't recognize any of cmds at all. Actually in vps provider's site i found that shell is unix based, so maybe you know how i can perform as root ? (I know it's newbie_
20:37  roe: what in the world makes you think *this* is the right place?
20:38  joe: have to tryu
20:38  joe: try*
20:38  nsadmin: he doesn't know whether it is or not
20:38  roe: joe, try #ubuntu
20:41  do0ob: ok great now suse is copying us, they're going to try a rolling release too, and we didn't even get a mention, would it hurt to say 'like debian'
20:42  nsadmin: did debian invent rolling releases?
20:42  roe: would that make you feel better?
20:42  nsadmin: s/^/why /
20:42  do0ob: its what makes debian sid special
20:44  do0ob: although debian sid's google chrome is pretty dated, its two versions behind
20:45  do0ob: oh i get it
20:45  do0ob: google has an official repo
20:46  roe: sid usually gets backed up when testing is frozen
20:47  do0ob: awww
20:47  do0ob: :(
20:47  do0ob: when will testing thaw?
20:49  eikenberry: testing is thawed when the stable release is made.
21:00  Kuifje111: why is the inspircd package broken?
21:00  osmosis: if I do   sudo rm file , then realize a made a mistake, ..is there a way to undo?
21:01  jelly-home: osmosis: restore from backup would be the canonical answer
21:01  osmosis: jelly-home, what is there is a running process still using the file? can I detect the inode from there maybe?
21:02  jelly-home: osmosis: if the file is open, you might be able to access it via /proc/PID/fd/
21:02  Iridos: depending on the filesystem and the type of file there are different ways to possibly get it back
21:03  Kuifje111: I get "dpkg: error processing inspircd (--configure): subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 7" when installing inspircd and it doesnt work when I run it after the install.
21:04  osmosis: jelly-home, says   9 -> /mnt/slices/pedywin.qcow2 (deleted)
21:04  osmosis: jelly-home, what do I do with that?
21:04  jelly-home: osmosis: hm, that part I'm unsure of... can you cat it? :-)
21:04  khem_: I get this when trying to compile a program in Debian:
21:04  khem_: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lglut
21:04  khem_: What package do I need for that?
21:05  nsadmin: Kuifje111: what is your /etc/debian_version and the version of inspircd you're trying to install
21:05  nsadmin: glut? libglut? *glut-dev?
21:05  jelly-home: khem_: something with lib, glut and ending in -dev.  apt-cache search libglut dev
21:05  Kuifje111: nsadmin: inspircd 1.1.22+dfsg-4, squeeze/sid
21:05  osmosis: jelly-home, yah.  maybe I should use dd ?
21:05  khem_: jelly-home: ahh libglut3-dev thankyou =)
21:06  nsadmin: , versions inspircd
21:06  judd: Package inspircd on i386 -- etch-backports: 1.1.18+dfsg-1~bpo40+1; lenny: 1.1.22+dfsg-3; sid: 1.1.22+dfsg-4; squeeze: 1.1.22+dfsg-4
21:06  khem_: nsadmin: thankyou too :)
21:06  docgnome: anyone use boinc? it just segfaults every time i try to start it. :-\
21:06  jelly-home: osmosis: it doesn't matter, use whatever works
21:06  nsadmin: so, the squeeze version and you're running squeeze?
21:06  Kuifje111: nsadmin: yes
21:07  nsadmin: there is a way to run the script so it outputs a lotta stuff
21:07  osmosis: jelly-home, awesome!  <crossing fingers>
21:08  Kuifje111: nsadmin: dpkg log gives: "status half-configured inspircd 1.1.22+dfsg-4"
21:08  nsadmin: the top line of the script should tell you what interpreter runs it
21:09  Kuifje111: nsadmin: ? the init.d script?
21:09  nsadmin: what script returned status code 7?
21:10  Kuifje111: nsadmin: the init.d script
21:10 --- emma is now known as em
21:10  Kuifje111: nsadmin: "Starting Inspircd... invoke-rc.d: initscript inspircd, action "start" failed."
21:10  nsadmin: oh, and the postinst script returned 7
21:11  stuckey: Anyone else noticed flash playback that is jumpy in squeeze?
21:11  Eggdrops: hi how should I upgarde the kernel for debian 5
21:11  abrotman: works fine for me
21:11  nsadmin: but the startup script also failed (as the postinst called the startup)
21:11  abrotman: Eggdrops: from what to what ?
21:12  nsadmin: what's the rc bug count on squeeze?
21:12  Eggdrops: abrotman from 2.6.26-2-686 to laste one
21:12  abrotman: that is the latest in lenny
21:13  Eggdrops: abrotman thanks
21:13  nsadmin: you could try the backports kernel
21:13  nsadmin: at your own risk :P
21:14  nsadmin: but also note that newer kernels have requirements on userland that might have you upgrading anyway
21:14  Eggdrops: now what I need to do is make debian as getway for my internet, meaning internet line comes to debian box and then share it to my other computer?
21:15  nsadmin: Eggdrops: what interfaces do you have?
21:15  Eggdrops: nsadmin could you please explain what do you mean by interface?
21:16  abrotman: why would you need a newer kernel for that ?
21:16  nsadmin: since he's running lenny, I'm thinking ipmasq
21:17  nsadmin: Eggdrops, a network interface card is hardware which somehow connects a network physically to your box
21:18  nsadmin: a network interface is a name that refers to either a network interface card or possibly a virtual connection
21:18  stuckey: abrotman: sorta freezes for a half second every now and then here
21:18  abrotman: sucks for you .. ask adobe why it's broken
21:20  tc_: I'm trying to use my second interface (pppd), which is not the default gateway. ping -I ppp0 works, but i.e. wget --bind-address IP doesn't. What am I missing?
21:25  EddiX: Hi. Does anyone know where I can find a decent wireless setup guide. lspci says my card is a Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 4965 AG or AGN [Kedron] Network Connection (rev 61)
21:26  blackplague1347: Hello all. How hard is Debian to use?
21:26  tc_: very
21:26  rudi_s: Depends.
21:26  nsadmin: Eggdrops when you run ifconfig -a, how many paragraphs do you see? (also, you'll notice each paragraph has a name)
21:27  nsadmin: blackplague1347: depends on what you're doing with it and what your background is
21:27  nsadmin: what do you use now?
21:27  cahoot: EddiX: you want firmware-iwlwifi (non-free)
21:28  EddiX: cahoot: Great, thanks! I've heard of it before but I just couldn't remember that package.
21:28  jelly-home: blackplague1347: to use, similar to other Linux distros.  To configure properly before everything works... it can be a pain.
21:28  dvs: EddiX: http://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi

21:31  khem_: i changed the CFLAGS to -fPIC in the Makefile but it does not make any difference
21:31  simonrvn: you add the PIC stuff, you don't replace all of them
21:33  khem_: simonrvn: how do oyu mean?
21:33  pix|: hi, does CONFIG_INOTIFY still exist in the vanilla kernel? If so what are the dependencies because it is always deleted if I use "make oldconfig" so only CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER is active.
21:33  nsadmin: pix|: are you running the vanilla kernel now?
21:34  pix|: nsadmin: yep
21:34  nsadmin: look in /boot
21:35  nsadmin: all kernels built with the scripts in kernel-package will have their config file placed there when the package is installed
21:35  jelly-home: nsadmin: .config doesn't show dependencies.
21:36  nsadmin: so it would answer the top half
21:37  jelly-home: /boot/config-2.6.35-trunk-686:CONFIG_INOTIFY=y
21:37  jelly-home: /boot/config-2.6.35-trunk-686:CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y
21:37  jelly-home: /boot/config-2.6.36-trunk-686:CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER=y
21:37  jelly-home: (not there in Debian's build of .36)
21:37  khem_: simonrvn: how could I do that?
21:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 954]
21:49  pix|: nsadmin: well, the new kernel deletes it. Since jelly-home says this option isn't present anymore in debian's .36 build and so in my vanilla .36 build I'd conclude it is obsolete
21:49  tuv: modprobe kvm (or kvm_intel) fails with: "kvm: disagrees about version of symbol smp_ops" "kvm: Unknown symbol smp_ops" in syslog
21:50  tuv: but if i reboot, it gets loaded automatically on boot
21:53  nsadmin: pix|: thanks for the clarification... hope you find a replacement
21:54  cusco: hi
21:56  cusco: facebook tells me I have no flash, Im using adobe flash nonfree
21:56  cusco: but I can whatch youtube...
21:56  cusco: anyone knows about this
21:57  alkisg: In http://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences this apt-sources line is mentioned, but it's wrong, can someone tell me the correct one? Do I even need a "non-us" line?
21:57  alkisg: deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main contrib non-free
21:58  abrotman: !non-us
21:58  dpkg: well, non-us is where we placed software previously unable to hosted within the USA.  Changes in legislation mean that post-<Woody>, there is no non-US, so you don't need it for Sarge, Etch, Lenny, Squeeze or Sid.  Ask me about <crypto> and <crypto in main>.  Old non-US packages (for slink, potato, woody) are at archive.debian.org.  http://wiki.debian.org/non-US
21:59  alkisg: Thanks, so this wiki page is seriously outdated :)
22:05  __cool__: hey! dunno if this is offtopic: i used s2ram, but the system wakes up 'wrong' 1 out of 5 times: no picture (backlight is on). i *can* login via ssh. i *can* 'ps' (without much use). but 'ps a' hangs <- i want to use xrandr to try and reset the display, only it hangs like 'ps a' it seems
22:06  pipeline: __cool__: try s2disk -- I own no laptop on which both s2ram AND s2disk works, but every one of them behaves well with one or the other.
22:07  pix|: nsadmin: thank you as well, cya
22:07  __cool__: pipeline: i have no swap. can i use s2disk?
22:07  __cool__: (and that doesn't help me at the moment to restore *this* session :)
22:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 960]
22:09  jelly-home: __cool__: does changing to the console and back make the video output reappear?
22:09  jelly-home: __cool__: (use chvt in the ssh session)
22:09  __cool__: pipeline: oh, and btw s2disk is a bad choice, cannot use: on cold start i would have to boot into windows to reinitialize the umts... not an option twice a day :/
22:11  __cool__: jelly-home: i'll try. but i don't think i'll work: i just tried s2ram again and it gave fgconsole: getconsolefd: Invalid argument, Switching from vt-1 to vt1, chvt: VT_ACTIVATE: Bad file descriptor, VT_WAITACTIVE: Bad file descriptor, Segmentation fault
22:12  __cool__: jelly-home: Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console
22:13  jelly-home: __cool__: nonfree video drivers may be an issue.  Also, various usb devices.
22:14  __cool__: jelly-home: yeah, it's the poulsbo driver. i suppose it *is* the problem. i just will not accept that there should be no way to force a re-init... and i'm very curious what makes 'ps a' hang. whicht rights does it take and where are they gone?
22:15  jelly-home: "strace ps a"
22:16  foetus: uhh, debian kernel not bootable -- needs 3dnow on a intel dualcore station..
22:16  __cool__: jelly-home: oh, yeah, good idea! thanks: open("/proc/980/cmdline", O_RDONLY)     = 6 , read(6, ^C <unfinished ...>
22:16  foetus: :-(
22:17  jelly-home: __cool__: get hardware with better drivers :-|
22:17  jelly-home: (ie. not GMA500)
22:17  foetus: so i need a live cd .. i must use the old piii kernel to build a new one..o man
22:18  __cool__: jelly-home: hm, only that doesn't let me see what the proc *is*, even as root it hangs on 'cat cmdline' or 'file exe' int the 980 dir.
22:18  jelly-home: foetus: btw, which Debian kernel says it "needs 3dnow", and what exactly does it say?
22:19  __cool__: jelly-home: and no, there is no other device with that form factor i think :||
22:19  foetus: jelly-home: optimized for athlon xp
22:19  jelly-home: __cool__: your kernel is too confused to fetch the data about that process... that this point, I guess only the reset button will recover
22:19  jelly-home: s/that/at/
22:20  jelly-home: foetus: oh.  that would be a very old Debian kernel, from a release that's not supported any more
22:21  jelly-home: foetus: you don't have any other kernel apart from that (I'm guessing) -k7 one?
22:22  PeteMall: I'm trying to jail the ssh/sftp users... what's the best way?
22:22  foetus: jelly-home: no, not woody. its lenny with a handbuilt kernel :-D
22:22  razieliyo: hey, I'm just installing debian testing by netinst and it fails when is downloading the 959 file
22:22  roe: jailing ssh is much tricker than jailing sftp
22:22  razieliyo: I've tried to redownload and reburn the cd
22:22  __cool__: jelly-home: oki, now i even killed the ssh connectability. will do the magic sysrq thing :/
22:22  razieliyo: but it spam the same problem
22:22  jelly-home: foetus: oh, it's not really a "debian kernel" then is it?
22:22  PeteMall: roe: I would much rather block ssh and jail sftp... any pointers?
22:23  roe: there are lots of guides on how to jail sftp properly
22:23  foetus: no, its the original debian source - so i must reconfigure and rebuild the source, np.
22:26  jelly-home: foetus: or, y'know, use the distro kernel.
22:26  shiftingcontrol: i had downloaded debian cd iso image and burnt using unetBootin in ubuntu and when i tried t boot usb,it showed me wrong cd/dvd image,what can cause this problem ?
22:27  dvs: shiftingcontrol: why couldn't you use k3b to burn the image?
22:27  abrotman: !usb install
22:27  dpkg: Yes, it is possible to install Debian from a USB stick/thumbdrive/pen drive/key, as long as your system's BIOS can boot from USB.  Details are in the Installation Guide, see http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/i386/ch04s03 .  To download USB stick images, ask me about <install debian>.  https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download to prepare from Windows.  BIOS can't boot from USB?  Use http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html
22:28  shiftingcontrol: dvs:k3b i have not tried ,withUnetbootin i tried opensuse in dvd it worked out
22:29  babilen: shiftingcontrol: might be an architecture problem -- please try the method detailed in installation guide (see dpkg's statement above) and report back. Make sure to copy the ISO *file* to the stick and that the architectures match
22:30  rastaval: hello do anyone here who is familiar with psyBNC?
22:30  rastaval: I would like to ask how to connect a psybnc to a proxy server with authentication info
22:30  dvs: oops. i missed the usb part
22:30  shiftingcontrol: babilen:sure,i ll follow the instruction and give a one more try
22:31  babilen: rastaval: You might want to try their forums
22:35  rastaval: babilen: thanks.. but i have been googling with it
22:35  rastaval: but never got any answer
22:35  shiftingcontrol: kde vs gnome which is adviced to use
22:36 * foetus is wondering about curiousity at freenode
22:36  abrotman: shiftingcontrol: try them both, you decide
22:37  shiftingcontrol: abrotman:kde is more lucartive ,gnome is simpleistic
22:37  babilen: rastaval: You might want to try anc (packaged in Debian)
22:37  babilen: rastaval: err, znc :)
22:38  babilen: rastaval: They also have a fairly large channel (here and on efnet)
22:46  foetus: lets close this terminal..
22:47  rastaval: babilen: i would love to try that, but, is is supported with freebsd?
22:48  jelly-home: freebsd?
22:48  babilen: rastaval: You are aware that you asked in #debian, don't you?
22:48  rastaval: yeah
22:49  rastaval: but you recommend that to me.
22:49  rastaval: that's why i'm asking if it is supported with unix
22:49  jelly-home: rastaval: asking here makes the assumption you're running the OS that's topical in this channel
22:50  Erbureth: jelly: what about debian-kfreebsd?
22:50  babilen: Erbureth: That would still be Debian and not FreeBSD
22:50  jelly-home: Erbureth: what about it, indeed
22:50  Erbureth: right...
22:54  hektik: how do you setup your mx record?

23:03  ma3x: i remember i enabled it somehow but can't remember how
23:03  abrotman: why would you not want it?
23:03  jelly-home: ma3x: you need to tell it where your root partition is.  you can use /dev/sdfafvsfs or LABEL=... or UUID=... but you have to use _something_
23:04  jelly-home: "Doctor, it hurts when I do this"
23:04  dvs: then do it again!

23:06  ma3x: and if i run later update-grub will it revert to the old uuid=.... option?
23:06  dvs: ma3x: sure, but if you add a drive it might not work again.

23:08  Bartzy|work: Hi
23:09  Bartzy|work: if I do some bash command (for... done), and in the end I do a &, it means that when I close my ssh session, this job will die ?
23:09  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy|work: Yes.
23:09  Bartzy|work: ok, how can I prevent that ? only 'screen' ?
23:09  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy|work: You need either nohup or screen.
23:09  Bartzy|work: one better than the other ?
23:10  alkisg: Or if the script doesn't need stdio, you can run it redirected to /dev/null, and turn shell job control off.. with those restrictions it'll work even if you logout from ssh afaik.
23:11  Bartzy|work: how can I turn shell job control off ?
23:11  alkisg: disown in bash
23:11  alkisg: set +m in sh I think
23:12  Bartzy|work: so disown my_command is just like nohup my_command ?
23:13  alkisg: No, it just tells bash not to keep it in the list of jobs that it controls.
23:13  alkisg: Night all
23:17  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy|work: screen is good if you need to reconnect to the job and controll it or see output.
23:17  Bartzy|work: lol I just used nohup without & in the end... had to close the session
23:17  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy|work: nohup's pretty good for "batch" type jobs that you just need to run.
23:18  Bartzy|work: OK, got it. thanks for your help :)

23:22  Kamping_Kaiser: dpkg: tell SpokY about paste
23:23  Kamping_Kaiser: SpokY: why do you need to compile a new kernel?
23:23 --- Guest16403 is now known as psych0_
23:23  SpokY: sorry: http://pastebin.com/B55FzNXC
23:23  SpokY: for my gameservers

23:25  SpokY: okay thanks, can u help me?
23:25  Kamping_Kaiser: babilen: thanks :)
23:26  Kamping_Kaiser: SpokY: are you recompiling a debian kernel or building one from scratch?
23:26  SpokY: i have building from a howto
23:26  babilen: SpokY: I would strongly recommend to use a newer kernel
23:27  SpokY: mhm but this kernel is optimize for css and 1.6
23:28 * jhutchins_lt wonders what cascading style sheets have to do with the kernel...
23:28  SpokY: its possible to fix this error?

23:29  jhutchins_lt: SpokY: Either you've skipped a step in the process or you have bad sourcecode.
23:30  SpokY: mhm i never have skip a step :S oh bad.. after 3 hours.. i need a new kernel? and begin from the start?
23:30  babilen: SpokY: 2.6.18 has a bunch of security problems and I doubt that fixes have been backported.
23:31  SpokY: which kernel i can use for cs 1.6 and css with realtime and 1000 hz ..
23:32  babilen: I am not quite sure what "cs 1.6" and "css" refers to ... probably country-strike
23:33  SpokY: yes, counter-strike 1.6 and counter-strike:source, i need a gameserver kernel
23:33  SpokY: or maybe can skip this step? and use the kernel ?
