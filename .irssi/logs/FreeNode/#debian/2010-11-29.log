08:24  dokma: did you try to reboot the machine?
08:24  johntramp: no
08:25  dokma: well.... try all that elementary stuff like cables, reboot etc
08:25  johntramp: do you think that is worth a try?
08:25  johntramp: alright
08:25  dokma: I just recently had one of mine monitors stop working
08:25  dokma: it turned out that the power cable has 2 parts and they got disconnected
08:25  dokma: bizzare

08:38  johntramp: dokma: haha that reboot somehow fixed it... reminds me of ms windows
08:38  dokma: pheewwww.... that crappy ms windows behaviour made me switch in the first place
08:39  dokma: thank God I did... I'd never be half the programmer I am today without the access to the code of the software I use
08:42  Cullz: is apt-zip easy to use?
08:42  Cullz: with debian offline and ubuntu online
09:22  WormFood: I had downloaded a 32-bit program, that I can't get to work under Debian. Now I was under the impression, that a vast majority of 32-bit software would work fine on a 64-bit system, as long as we had the 32-bit libraries it needed...other than software that works very tightly with the OS, under what conditions would a 32-bit program not be compatible?
09:40  bolt-work_: WormFood: what program? where did you get it from? how did you install it? how are you trying to run it and how is it not doing so?
09:40 --- bolt-work_ is now known as bolt-bork
09:40 --- bolt-bork is now known as bolt-work
09:41  jelly-hme: WormFood: try providing more concrete data instead of a generic question. how did you verify all the required libraries were installed?
09:41  WormFood: bolt-work, it is a chat program, I downloaded it from the company's web site. It is a tarball, so there is no installing it, just extract and execute....and I don't have the computer in front of me, so I can't tell you the exact error message (but can probably find it in a few minutes)
09:41  jelly-hme: WormFood: what chat program?
09:41  WormFood: jelly-hme, I was looking for a generic answer. I wasn't looking for specific help with this program.
09:42  WormFood: jelly-hme, qq
09:42  bolt-work: WormFood: the generic answer, like jelly-hme hinted at, is that you probably don't have the required libraries for it
09:42  WormFood: other than lacking 32-bit libraries, and software that work tightly with the kernel, what other problems would 32-bit software have running on a 64-bit system?
09:43  jelly-hme: WormFood: oh.  Could be any number of things: missing or different libs than it was built against; missing locale settings; buggy app
09:44  jelly-hme: !tell WormFood about ABI
09:44  WormFood: a missing locale setting would affect 32/64-bit software?
09:44  WormFood: I mean, affect one and not the other?
09:44  jelly-hme: WormFood: read the wiki page abot what ABI means.
09:45  WormFood: I know what ABI means
09:45  jelly-hme: you don't seem to realize the implications.

09:47 --- D4rKr0W`afk is now known as D4rKr0W
09:47  WormFood: obviously I don't, if a locale setting would break a 32-bit program, on a 64-bit system...that does not make much sense to me
09:47  jelly-hme: that wasn't about locale settings, but libs
09:48  WormFood: yes, I understand the deal with libraries
09:49  jelly-hme: so you realize a slightly different build of same library, or a slightly different version of it, might make an old binary not work correctly
09:50  jelly-hme: the library needn't be necessarily missing
09:52  WormFood: yes, I'm also aware of that.
09:53  jelly-hme: that's an option you didn't mention
09:54  WormFood: not specifically, but I was trying to word my question to exclude library issues.
09:55  Argafal: hi, I was looking for vim-spellfiles (for swedish, german and spanish). It seems they got removed at some point - can anyone recommend a trustworthy source?
09:55  WormFood: I said "...as long as we had the 32-bit libraries it needed..."
09:55  jelly-hme: WormFood: the only way you can exclude them with certainty is if your vendor explicitely created their binary to work in Debian.
09:56  jelly-hme: (the same release you're trying to use)
09:56  WormFood: I'm trying to understand other potential issues between 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
09:57  jelly-hme: WormFood: a reasonably interesting thing to try is installing Debian i386, and booting it with an -amd64 kernel.  You'll have completely 32bit userspace and a 64bit kernel.
09:57  WormFood: from my understanding, having the proper 32-bit libraries is probably the biggest thing to making 32-bit software work on a 64-bit system under Linux (I've had various 64-bit vs. 32-bit issues on winblows)
09:58  WormFood: yeah, you're right. I hadn't thought of that before, but it should work....I'm supposing that would be a good test platform for troubleshooting issues like this, you think?
10:00  jelly-hme: it's almost the same as having a chrooted i386 installation on an amd64 system
10:01  WormFood: cool idea, thanks for the tip jelly-hme, I'll have to play around with that (probably do it under a virtual system)
10:05  WormFood: and one thing that really, really pisses me off about this program I'm trying to make work, is the fact that the Winblows version of the software supports multiple languages, the Linux version is only in Chinese.
10:06  jelly-hme: if it's not in Debian, complain to the vendor
10:07  WormFood: of course it isn't debian......I wished it was, at least then I'd have the option to get source code

I only installed the base system and and grub and rebooted now my gnome and other things are missing, I gave the command apt-get install gnome on reboot but its asking for CD .. so I inserted the CD but my Debian CD isn't being recognized can some1 help me out here regarding this
10:21  WormFood: I installed squeeze from a netinstall cd the other week, and when it first booted, it came up in a high res text screen (larger than 80x25 or 80x50)...but after that, it went back to 80x25.....how do I make it stay in that higher resolution that it initially defaulted to?

10:40  i0i: Hey it seems when you install php5-cgi you get two executables... /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5 and /usr/bin/php5-cgi
10:40  i0i: according to diff they're different but they're the same size... no hardlink, no symlink
10:40  i0i: anyone know why there is two (presumably subtly different) copies?
10:42  macrobat: knowing nothing about php, i would guess /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php5 is a library
10:42  i0i: macrobat: they're both EFL binaries
10:43  macrobat: ok, then i know even less :D
10:48  delby: hi. i just installed squeeze on a machine that already had xp and lenny. at the grub stage of the install it said it found both other operating system so i let it install grub (in effect reinstall as i already had installed from lenny).
10:49  delby: when i rebbot, the grub menue only shows me the new sqweeze and the boot dir. does not have menu.lst. what shall i do?
10:55  at0m: delby: grub2 uses /boot/grub/grub.cfg and user settings are in /etc/default/grub
10:56  at0m: delby: grub-install checks that default/grub to make grub.cfg
10:56  delby: at0m: thanks. any idea why xp and lenny not showing even though it said it found them during install?
10:57  at0m: delby: osprober checks for other installed OS's and adds them
10:57  at0m: maybe you dont have osprober installed?
10:57  at0m: maybe os-prober
10:58  delby: i used the netinst squeeze iso, and the prober did find them during install, just did not add them to the menu

To install system-wide, copy them into /usr/share/fonts/truetype/myfonts or into /usr/local/share/fonts/truetype/myfonts (but you will have to add /usr/local/share/fonts/ to your xorg.conf) and run fc-cache -fv as root.

13:55  SNow: 8
13:56  rozie: depesz: are you trying to package nginx by yourself?
13:57  depesz: rozie: well - i'm trying to make .deb out of sources from sid.
13:57  depesz: rozie: major reason - version.
13:57  themill: albatrossen: if you last released version 2.1 and will next release version 2.2, then you could use either 2.1+svn1234 or 2.2~svn1234 for the upstream version component, depending on whether you are seeing this as an update to an existing version or a prerelease to the next version (and you are sure what your next version will be)
13:57  rozie: depesz: if this is only version, you can take a look on backports.debian.org

13:58  depesz: forgot about backports. checking nginx there
13:58  rozie: dpkg-buildpackage

13:59  albatrossen: themill, thanks that helped me a lot; hope that info gets included in the policy manual someday
14:00  themill: albatrossen: it's better for devref than for policy (and I thought it was there somewhere already). /msg dpkg devref
14:00  dondelelcaro: albatrossen: it's something that's more appropriate for the developer's reference; iirc, it's already there
14:00  depesz: rozie: hmm dpkg-buildpackage dies on unmet dependencies. to libgd2-noxpm-dev :(
14:00  depesz: rozie: which I can't use, as it uninstalls libgd2-xpm-dev, which in turn is required for another package on the system
14:02  albatrossen: themill, dondelelcaro : I apologize for my ignorance, I have never heard of the devref, and it didn't show up in my google searches; I'll read it right away
14:03  themill: albatrossen: you might want to "/msg dpkg version compare" to check how versions are sorted. My use of ~ in one example and + in the other was entirely deliberate, btw.

14:56  BusMaster: i have an embedded mpc5200 (powerpc) processor based board which can take a compact flash card. I can already boot a kernel to the point where it panics because there is no root fs (and works with a ramdisk). My question is: How can I install debian-for-powerpc on  a compact-flash card such that I can pass a root=/dev/sda1 option to my kernel and have a working debian system? I tried EmDebian, but the stuff documented doesn't actually work
14:59  abrotman: BusMaster: FWIW, there is a #emdebian on irc.oftc.net
14:59  abrotman: BusMaster: so basically, you just want to untar the root filesystem onto your flash card?
15:00  BusMaster: abrotman, asking 'anyone home?' on that channel yielded no result :( Yeah, I want a working rootfs on the compact flash card (and it'd be nice to add packaged to the card when I realize that I've forgotten something)
15:00  allblack: Can you recommend me an 10G ethernet card that has iscsi offloading and works ok under Debian?
15:00  abrotman: BusMaster: they used to have a base.tar.gz, but i don't see that anymore
15:00  BusMaster: abrotman, its a 4 gig CF card, I need about 2 gig free for my application.. I don't care about making a minimal system..it should fit in 2 gigs and should work.
15:01  abrotman: BusMaster: the easy answer is doing it on real hardware ...
15:05  BusMaster: abrotman, how? I am already at a point where I can boot the kernel with a ramdisk and mount the CF card under /mnt. Where do I go from there? Also, there is no grub (the system uses a bootloader called U-boot) how do I avoid grub?
15:05  abrotman: BusMaster: i meant install it on real hardware, tar that up, copy to your flash
15:05  BusMaster: abrotman, real hardware as in my own laptop? (but my laptop is amd64, not powerpc). I do have access to the CF card through a usb card-reader though..is there a way to install a powerpc distribution on the compact flash through my laptop?

16:53  shane4ubuntu: is debian stable considered a rolling release?  or is that only the testing branch?
16:54  Vroomfondle: it's not a rolling release
16:54  shane4ubuntu: Vroomfondle: ok, thanks!  how about the testing branch?
16:54  Vroomfondle: yeah, testing "rolls"
16:55  Vroomfondle: as I understand it, anyway
16:55  shane4ubuntu: ok, thanks
16:55  shane4ubuntu: that was my basic understanding of it too, just wanted to confirm.
16:57  shane4ubuntu: one more question, how about upgrading from the current stable to the next current stable?  is that buggy or a seemless upgrade?
16:57  pipeline: shane4ubuntu: upgrades from stable to stable are guaranteed to work correctly
16:58  pipeline: shane4ubuntu: in fact you can have it done more or less automatically -- if you put "stable" instead of a specific release name in sources.list, when the new stable comes out, off you go.
16:59  Sm0ke0ut: it ofc. requires a reboot (maybe 2, depending on the changes) :-)
16:59  stew: you DON'T want to have 'stable' in sources.list
16:59  jhutchins_lt: subsume: System level changes that assume you are runnign Debian can permenently break a non-debian system.  Please seek help in the support channels for your own distribution.  IRC may not be helpful for smaller distributions, you will probably need to seek out the mailing lists.
16:59  themill: pipeline: eek. Don't do that.
16:59  shane4ubuntu: pipeline: really, that is very good news, in effect making the stable 'sort of like' a rolling distro, obviously not equivalent, but similar.
16:59  stew: shane4ubuntu: no, you don't want to upgrade stable that way, you want to follow the procedure in the release notes when the next stable comes out
16:59  themill: shane4ubuntu: oldstable→stable upgrades always require manual intervention, but a lot of work is done to keep it to a minimum.
17:00  jhutchins_lt: Testing is not actually a rolling release, it is staged.  Sid is "rolling", but it's not a release.
17:00  stew: people's definitions of rolling release differ
17:00  stew: and people's definition of relelase (debian, for instance, DOES consider sid a release, even if jhutchins_lt doesn't)
17:00  shane4ubuntu: ok, rolling release I mean, no upgrading, packages are upgraded shortly (relative) after a new release.
17:01  pipeline: well it is an upgrade...
17:01  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: And then there's backports.debian.org and volatile.debian.org, if that has not yet been mentioned.  Those are for people running stable who want some newer stuff.
17:01  stew: shane4ubuntu: then no, perhaps testing isn't always rolling
17:01  pipeline: shane4ubuntu: it's rolling only in the sense the word "stable" remains valid in sources.list after the new release.  It's 100% staged.
17:01  stew: shane4ubuntu: since packages may take a long time to get updated in testing after a new version of the software is released
17:01 --- earwax is now known as WormFood
17:01  stew: pipeline: "stable" should not be used in sources.list
17:02  shane4ubuntu: stew: right, but that would be within reason, I mean, obviously you can't expect packages the next day, all is depending on the size, and dep's of a package.
17:02  stew: IMHO, stable should be made invalid on the debian mirrors
17:02  karlpinc: stew: That would be a good idea.  Perhaps a bug report?
17:03  stew: shane4ubuntu: you should expect many packages in testing to be perhaps six months to a year old, especially now when testing is 'frozen'
17:03  subsume: jhutchins_lt, I'm not using debian??
17:03  shane4ubuntu: karlpinc: ok, I'm familiar with backborts, but volatile, sounds, well, volatile. :)
17:03  jhutchins_lt: subsume: Your kernel is not a debian kernel.
17:03  Sm0ke0ut: now I wonder, why not using "stable"? Even if the releasename is changing you will require to do a dist-upgrade afaik
17:03  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: It's mostly for anti-spam rules and suchlike.
17:03  catsup: shane4ubuntu: volatile is for frequently-changing packages, not unstable ones
17:03  abrotman: Sm0ke0ut: because when a new 'stable' is released, bad thigns can happen to someone unsuspecting
17:04  subsume: jhutchins_lt, oh, I see. so I should probably check linode too.
17:04  shane4ubuntu: catsup: ok, thanks
17:04  jhutchins_lt: !based on debian
17:04  dpkg: Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't know what changes were made by your distribution and it probably falls short of Debian's standards.  #debian only supports Debian; you should respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
17:04  karlpinc: Sm0ke0ut: Upgrading to a new stable can require things be done in the right order or else you lose packages and otherwise break things.
17:04  shane4ubuntu: so looking for more up-to-date and relatively stable, SID or testing would be OK?
17:04  stew: Sm0ke0ut: and an upgrade from one release to another is much more likely to be successful when you follow the procedure developed by the release managers to ensure it works.  somethings there are dependencies you need to follow, like for the next one, it will be "upgrade kernel and udev, reboot, continue to upgrade..."
17:05  Sm0ke0ut: I see
17:05  Sm0ke0ut: In that case I'll update my sources.lst before something goes wrong =P
17:05  dkr: shane4ubuntu: testing, yes. but not sid. sid is the nickname for unstable
17:05  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: Many find testing stable enough.  Sid is probably not a good idea unless you know what you're doing.  (See also: /msg dpkg sns)
17:06  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: YMMV.  But you don't get the same kind of security support in testing as you do in stable.
17:06  shane4ubuntu: dkr: karlpinc  ahh, ok, I guess I was thinking testing was sid, not true. :)
17:06  karlpinc: s/kind/level/
17:06  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: It's confusing, and there's more than one way to interpret it.
17:06  shane4ubuntu: is there a name for testing?
17:07  abrotman: shane4ubuntu: currently, squeeze
17:07  abrotman: until it becomes stable
17:07  stew: shane4ubuntu: currently it is squeeze, at some time soon squeeze will become stable and wheezy will become testing (and then much later in the future wheezy becomes the next stable)
17:08  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: I prefer stable.  Becuase I want my computer to work when I sit down to work.
17:08  shane4ubuntu: ok, is it considered unsafe to have testing in the source.lst?
17:09  abrotman: you have to understand that testing breaks from time to time
17:09  stew: and it doesn't necessarily get timely security fixes
17:09  themill: shane4ubuntu: depends on whether you are wanting to be part of debian development or not. /msg dpkg moving target
17:09  shane4ubuntu: karlpinc: understood, I like a good balance between new/stable  I like new. :)
17:09  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: Backports is new enough for me.  (Which also does not have the same level of security support as stable.)
17:10  shane4ubuntu: my main problem is using stable, the packages are a bit old for me. and moving/transfering from my current distro to stable is a backward step.
17:10  themill: shane4ubuntu: just s/old/well tested/ and be happy.
17:11  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: You looked at backports?
17:12  pipeline: You can have stability and a long lifecycle, OR you can have new packages all the time.  You can't have both.
17:12  abrotman: shane4ubuntu: but when squeeze is released, they won't be "old" anymore
17:12  shane4ubuntu: karlpinc: perhaps backports is my key to the balance.
17:12  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: (Only "middle aged".  :)
17:12  shane4ubuntu: does squeeze have a release date?
17:12  karlpinc: !guess the release date
17:12  dpkg: i guess guess the release date is a game you can play!  Look at http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/ and guess when the green line will reach 0.  Ask me about <squeeze pool>.
17:13  shane4ubuntu: lol, ok, I think probably squeeze would be ok for me, I don't mind a little breakage here and there, and don't mind finding work arounds.
17:13  abrotman: woohoo, green line going back up!
17:13  dkr: stable for servers and testing for workstations
17:14  abrotman: or stable for workstatoins, if you need them to work all the time
17:14  karthick87: Is there an elegant way, other than messing with /etc/rc?.d to control the daemon loading at boot time?My personal concern is stopping Nginx from loading at boot, while setting lighttpd to do load at boot.
17:14  abrotman: karthick87: update-rc.d
17:14  pipeline: there is also a chkconfig package for debian
17:14  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: It's not very accurate to compare the version numbers of Debian packages with those from other distros.  While they may be similar, it's possible that the Debian packages have been heavily patched and contain fixes found in significantly later versions from other distros.
17:15  karthick87: abrotman: anyother way?
17:15  shane4ubuntu: jhutchins_lt: true, but when I backup my Evolution data, and want to transfer, going backwards is bad, tried that before.
17:15  abrotman: karthick87: what's wrong with that?
17:16  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: Depends on the Ev release I guess.
17:16  karthick87: abrotman: I dont want to mess that,that's why i am asking
17:16  jhutchins_lt: karthick87: There's also rcconf
17:16  abrotman: karthick87: AIUI, it's the answer to your question
17:16  shane4ubuntu: jhutchins_lt: true, and that was a few years ago that I tried that, with the same distros, I guess giving it a try is about the only thing I can do, on a testing partition.
17:17  karthick87: abrotman: AIUI?
17:21  shane4ubuntu: ok, one more question, if I start with stable (Lenny?) and decide, I want newer, enable backports get some updates, still not content, I can then move to squeeze (testing) in my source.list  is that a realistic plan?  All this on a testing partition, so breakage wouldn't be of huge concern, this would be learning. :)
17:21  dkr: yes
17:22  shane4ubuntu: and in effect only have to download one installation source, ie lenny.
17:23  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: Yes, that's a good plan, in fact if you upgrade to testing that's one of the tests that's needed right now.
17:24  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: It would be nice if people could shapshot their lenny system so that if they have problems with the upgrade and the problems are fixed they can confirm the fix.
17:24  jhutchins_lt: Running testing as a boot option is a great way to contributed.  You can mount the install chroot and update it, then boot to see if your issues are addressed.
17:24  shane4ubuntu: jhutchins_lt: ok, if I installed on a testing partition, I could do that just for kicks. :)   Ohh, right, good idea, full backup before upgrade.
17:25  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: (There's also lvm snapshots, but backups are safer.)
17:25  jhutchins_lt: Yeah, two advantages, if the upgrade breaks, you fall back to functional, and you can re-run the upgrade to see if it's fixed.
17:25  shane4ubuntu: hmm, I like good ole tar. :)
17:26  jhutchins_lt: When I say snapshot I mean a full backup of a system at a point in time, often like a dd image of the unmounted partition.
17:26  karlpinc: jhutchins_lt: Where to find the lenny->squeeze release notes documenting how to upgrade?
17:26  jhutchins_lt: Very easy to restore to exactly where you were.
17:26  jhutchins_lt: lessee...
17:27  jhutchins_lt: lenny->squeeze
17:27  jhutchins_lt: !lenny->squeeze
17:27  jhutchins_lt: dpkg: thump
17:27  dpkg: jhutchins_lt: bugger all, i dunno
17:27  shane4ubuntu: ok, installation method, I don't like downloading all the cd's, can I get the net-install and then do a minimal install and chroot to finish the installation?  My internet is not the fastest.
17:27  jhutchins_lt: karlpinc: May not be compiled yet.
17:28  shane4ubuntu: jhutchins_lt: right, I did those with something, hmm, a bootable cd that would image the partition, I forget what that was
17:28  karlpinc: jhutchins_lt: How can they be testing the procedure if it does not exist?
17:28  shane4ubuntu: ddrescue?  or something like that, a linux backup bootable cd
17:29  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: clonezilla
17:29  shane4ubuntu: yes, that was it, very nice, quick and easy.
17:30  jhutchins_lt: karlpinc: Roughly replace lenny with squeeze in sources list, update, upgrade, full-upgrade, I don't know if someone has better notes yet.
17:31  jhutchins_lt: karlpinc: Ah, here: http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101116b
17:31  archman: hello
17:32  shane4ubuntu: how many of the 30CD's do I really need?
17:32  archman: can i use the debian live cd (version 5 i think) to install debian without having to start the gnome DE?
17:32  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: 1
17:32  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: I prefer netinstalls.  That downloads only the actual packages you need.
17:32  archman: since i don't have a mouse
17:32  stew: archman: yes, just don't select "desktop install" when prompted, stick to 'standard'
17:33  shane4ubuntu: jhutchins_lt: does netinstall give me tty? I don't want to have to wait for 1GB of packages to download.
17:33  karlpinc: !squeeze release notes
17:33  dpkg: A draft of the squeeze release notes can be found at http://deb.li/jUOC and will be periodically updated as the release notes are finalised.  See also http://bugs.debian.org/release-notes and http://wiki.debian.org/NewInSqueeze .  Also ask me about <i-g>, <install squeeze>, <firmware images>.
17:33  archman: stew: i have only the "live" and "live(failsafe)" options
17:33  archman: stew: and memtest and help too, sure
17:33  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: The release notes are the upgrade instructions.
17:33  stew: archman: oh, sorry, i missed the "live" part
17:33  archman: ;)
17:34  shane4ubuntu: ok, thanks karlpinc
17:34  karlpinc: shane4ubuntu: Netinstall will install a minimal system, if that's what you're asking.
17:35  jhutchins_lt: shane4ubuntu: Kindof depends on what choices you make.
17:35  stew: archman: if you don't get an answer here try #debian-live on irc.debian.org
17:35  shane4ubuntu: ok, I remember doing netinstall before, and having my computer tied up forever downloading, I must have mad bad choices. :)
17:35  archman: it's a Debian Lenny live (20090215)
17:35  shane4ubuntu: thanks karlpinc jhutchins_lt much appreciated!
17:36  karlpinc: archman: You can always do a ctrl-alt-f1 and get a console.
17:36  archman: karlpinc: smart ;)
17:38  archman: karlpinc: what's the text install command? (or ncurses, if there are any)
17:38  karlpinc: archman: aptitude
17:41  karlpinc: Is the <squeeze release notes> factoid wrong?  http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101116b says http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/releasenotes is the right url.
17:43  stew: dpkg: squeeze release notes =~ s,http://deb.li/jUOC,http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/releasenotes,
17:43  dpkg: stew: OK
17:43  themill: karlpinc: the URL in the factoid is regenerated daily -- I have no idea how often the one on debian.org is being regenerated. (it lacks some changes that were made yesterday, for example)
17:43  stew: oh
17:43  themill: stew: nah, leave it.
17:43  themill: if vorlon isn't regenerating them daily, he should be pretty soon...

17:47  sec_goat: Does anyone have any experience with RDESKTOP ? I want to be able to create an icon (script?) to connect me to specific computers w/ specific parameters, how easy is this to do?
17:48  dkr: sec_goat: are you suing gnome?  there is a "launcher" applet you can plug in any command for

17:50  sec_goat: dkr: I belive I am. .  Add to panel, Custom Application Launcher?
17:50  dkr: sec_goat: exactly.  then you just type in the command to launch as something like  rdesktop -u Administrator hostname
17:51  sec_goat: dkr: will that avoid the having a temrinal window open for every instance as well?
17:52  dkr: sec_goat: yes.  unless you change that drop-down to say "app in terminal"
17:52  jhutchins_lt: sec_goat: rdesktop customizes it's sessions through the command line, so just check the manpage for the options you want to use.
17:52  sec_goat: dkr: perfect, easy than I expected thankyou!
17:54  Mowee: Hey :)
17:57  k1ng: anyone got COD: black ops for pc?

18:01  sec_goat: I am trying to get Flash installed for Iceweasel, or just for Debian in generall. when i do an apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree I get this message: flashplugin-nonfree is not available, but is referred to by another package.
18:01  sec_goat:  how do I get around this?
18:01  solifugus: Anyone know how to get a list of sub-domains?  I don't see how using nslookup.. or dig...
18:01  solifugus: reading their man pages
18:01  nixfloyd: solifugus: dig ALL domain.com
18:02  compaq: I just did rm * rar instead of rm *.rar, and deleted some files accidentally, Anyone know how to recover?
18:02  nixfloyd: but it will work only if zone transfer is allowed for anyone by the dns server
18:02  dkr: !tell sec_goat about dmm
18:02  stew: solifugus: you could try "dig domainname axfr" but not many nameservers are configured to allow that from a random ip address
18:02  Sm0ke0ut: in fact, none should be
18:02  themill: compaq: restore from a recent backup is the best recovery method.
18:02  karthick87: We just got a Xerox Workcentre 3220 in the office, and the 3119 drivers keep showing "out of paper" when trying to print.Any ideas how to set this one up?
18:03  dkr: !tell sec_goat about adobe flash
18:03  sec_goat: dkr: thanks again man!
18:03  compaq: themill, no other way to recover.  Cause, isn't it that just the inode is something is deleted, but the data is still on disk untill over ridden?

18:12  Digdilem: prognosis ain't good, especially for rars that a crc'd. text files, but give it a try if you've backed everything else up
18:12  Digdilem: woo, bad sentance. i meant rars that are crc'd rather than text
18:14  solifugus: nixfloyd and stew: yeah.. I'm trying to get a list of sub-domains under ctsi.ufl.edu and it's not giving me anything.
18:14  solifugus: I am starting to think this is some security thing.
18:15  jhutchins_lt: solifugus: Zone dumps have been mostly secured for a while now.
18:15  stew: solifugus: yes, its expected

18:40  Iridos: you might want to say what version of Debian you're talking about, mate
18:45  Siegfried: Iridos, Lenny
18:47  Iridos: that's supposed to update /boot/grub/menu.lst... dunno about create, as that usually happens during installation - either installation of Debian or when you install grub
18:48  stew: Siegfried: according to the manpage, yes, it is supposed to propose to create a menu.lst
18:57  karthick87: how to reinstall removed repositories?
18:59  jhutchins_lt: karthick87: How did you remove them?
19:00  karthick87: from software sources
19:00  stew: karthick87: what repository do you want to re-add?
19:01  karthick87: stew: i wanna reset it to default.Is that possible?
19:02  jhutchins_lt: !sources
19:02  dpkg: The list of repositories for installing packages is /etc/apt/sources.list and has lines like "deb http://ftp.CC.debian.org/debian lenny main" and "deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main" where CC is your country code.  Be sure to run "aptitude update" after editing sources.list.  Also see <mirrors> <apt-spy> <lenny security> <testing security> "man sources.list" and /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list
19:02  stew: karthick87: what release of debian are you running?
19:03  jhutchins_lt: Standard would probably be main and security, posslbiy with contrib and/or non-free.
19:03  lelu: should /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf be empty upon aptitude install logcheck ?
