00:00  andreas122: yes
00:00  ragnar_de: andreas122: dont run, edit it. and yes, you have to be root to edit it.
00:03  acemi_:  andreas122: you can add the startup applications in ~/.fluxbox/starup IIRC
00:04  acemi_: andreas122: or in [startup] section in ~/.fluxbox/apps
00:05  ragnar_de: wow, a flux pro :)
00:06  andreas122: acemi, i have tried this, but after then the flux wasent start anymore
00:06  andreas122: i dont know why
00:07  stuckey: jhutchins_lt: is there a comparable app in the repos?
00:07  acemi_: did you add & at the end of your application line?
00:07  acemi_: andreas122: http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php?title=Editing_the_startup_file
00:08  jhutchins_lt: stuckey: Not that I know of.  For fluxbox, right?
00:08  stuckey: jhutchins_lt: no it isn't just for fluxbox.
00:08  jhutchins_lt: Cool.  I may try it out when they get closer to a release.
00:09  stuckey: jhutchins_lt: it works fine now -- I've tried it. I would like to install it this time though dpkg instead of just running the binary.
00:10  jhutchins_lt: stuckey: I wonder why they don't offer a .deb
00:10  stuckey: The stuff on github is debanized. One just needs to figure out how to build it.
00:15  stuckey: jhutchins_lt: do you know where I can get help building the package?
00:16  jhutchins_lt: stuckey: That is something I have not yet done in debian, I have been content with available packages.  I would suggest contacting the developer or whatever support channel he may have set up.
00:17  ragnar_de: ok, bye all

00:35  jhutchins_lt: Sorry, I thought that was candle replying to me.
00:36  candle_:  its removing alot of packages ..
00:36  jhutchins_lt: candle_: Yep.
00:36  Arrowmaster: you broke it, reinstall
00:36  jhutchins_lt: candle_: What did you do to trigger this problem?
00:36  candle_: will it leave me with a terminal and bash ?
00:36  jhutchins_lt: candle_: Probably.  It may even rebuild the things it's removing.
00:36  candle_: i upgraded from lenny to squeeze

00:38  ethanol: I'm trying to mount a nfs share from 2 remote machines. one instantly mounts it, the other just fails. using -v they both pretty much walk through all the same steps. except after mount.nfs: trying 10.0.1.1 prog 100005 vers 3 prot UDP port 2049 the first machine succeeds, the second just stalls. any one a clue perhaps? both lenny machines, up to date
00:39  candle_: Current status: 1 broken [-37], 390 updates [-174], 27570 new [-17].
00:39  jhutchins_lt: candle_: Is it done?
00:39  babilen: candle_: You followed that procedure? Did you have a look at the release notes for Squeeze? They contain a lot of details on how to conduct the upgrade.
00:40  babilen: candle_: That certainly does not look as if you succeeded with the update. Might I ask which steps you have completed so far? Have you already installed a new kernel, upgraded udev and rebooted?
00:43  candle_: babilen:  off course
00:43  candle_: babilen:  when i did the minimal upgrade all was well
00:43  candle_: but when i did the dist upgrade all went wrong
00:44  babilen: candle_: So, you are at 4.5.6 in the release notes?
00:45  acemi_: i think there is a missing ' for lenny->squeeze info of dpkg. at the end of 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,`  part
00:47  babilen: acemi_: Might be, Please make sure it is indeed missing (looks like it) and change the factoid accordingly
00:48  acemi_: i tried. it seems that it must be: linux-image-`uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,'`
00:48 * babilen takes out his glasses
00:48  acemi_: a ' before the last `
00:49  babilen: acemi_: Yeah, it is missing. Great that you've spotted it :)
00:49  themill: fixed, thanks
00:50  pittstains: there's no way to change the owner of a running process, is there?
00:51  pittstains: i'd like to disown a process, but i started the user who started it uses /bin/sh as a shell, and hence disown isn't available
00:52  pittstains: i thought maybe i could take over the process then disown it...
00:58  babilen: pittstains: Not quite sure if that is what you after, but you can tell "su" which shell to execute with the "-s / --shell" option
00:59  babilen: pittstains: But doesn't disown only works on jobs started in the current shell? Check the help for it ...
00:59  pittstains: babilen: yeah, disown only work in the current shell
01:00  pittstains: babilen: i think i either need to run a command as the user in question to disown it (not aware of the sh equivalent of disown, if one exists), or i need to run a command as root that transfers ownership of the job to another user... and i don't think such a command exists
01:02  jhutchins_lt: pittstains: Screen would be useful for something like this, but requires that the program be started in screen.
01:03  pittstains: jhutchins_lt: thanks.  yeah, i wouldn't have started the job with that user if i'd known that disown isn't available in dash

02:29  canthus13: I've just swapped motherboards on my media server (running Lenny), from MSI to Asrock.  For some reason, the NIC isn't found.  This happened once before, when swapping a motherboard on another machine. How would I convince it to find the NIC without reinstalling?
02:29  zinx: canthus13: what NIC is it?  some require firmware that you must install separately
02:29  sc30317: Hey all; I want to get a better understanding of how apt works.  Does anyone know where I can download the apt source code or read more about it?
02:29  CaT[t3]: was it not found or was it found but has different eth* assignments?
02:29  stew: canthus13: are you sure its not just renamed?  udev would try to give a new nic a new name, like eth1 instead of eth0
02:30  canthus13: ifconfig only shows lo.
02:30  stew: sc30317: http://packages.debian.org/apt

02:32  dpkg: udev has the ability to statically rename Ethernet cards based on MAC address since version 0.090.  The addresses are configured in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules (Lenny, Squeeze) or /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules (Etch).  If you want the mappings to change, edit the respective file.  To apply changes: "udevadm trigger" ("udevtrigger" on Etch) or reload the relevant driver module.  See also <forcedeth mac>, <udev>.

03:02  rwt: wait fund it
03:02  rwt: *found
03:02  rwt: whats better
03:03  Pinchiukas: Anyone? wvdial?
03:03  Wyzard: rwt: The difference between them is the inode_ratio setting, so take a look at the "-i" option in "man mke2fs"
03:04  Wyzard: rwt: largefile4 gives you fewer inodes, which means a lower limit on the total number of files that can exist on the filesystem, but also gives you more available space (since the inode tables are smaller)
03:05  Wyzard: rwt: I'd suggest you try largefile4, using the "-v" option of mke2fs so it tells you the actual number of inodes created
03:05  jelly-home: rwt: did the mkfs succeed? If it did, you don't have to tweak anything further.
03:06  Wyzard: rwt: and if you think you might ever need to have more than that many files on the filesystem at the same time, run mke2fs again with the largefile setting
03:06  jelly-home: ext4 has decent fast fsck, I don't think there's a reason to skimp on inodes

03:10  rwt: 'mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -i largefile -v /dev/mapper/sda' == just checking, that seems right...

03:11  Cullz: ok. how is it added? i have added non-free in sources.list and updated. still wont find it
03:11  babilen: Cullz: You are probably asking about flash. You want to install flashplugin-nonfree from backports. See http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/
03:11  Wyzard: rwt: Looks reasonable, though I'm a bit confused that you have a device-mapper node named "sda"
03:12  Cullz: will sun-java6-jre do it?
03:12  Wyzard: rwt: since it's presumably not the same device as the physical disk /dev/sda
03:12  rwt: no
03:12  rwt: well loopback
03:12  babilen: Cullz: Another way of dealing with this is to upgrade to Squeeze or reinstalling using the Squeeze weeklies.
03:12  Wyzard: Something like dm-crypt?
03:12  Wyzard: I'd use "sda-plaintext" for that
03:12  Wyzard: (though I actually use mine as an LVM PV rather than a raw filesystem)
03:13  rwt: mkfs.ext4: invalid inode ratio largefile (min 1024/max 65536)
03:13  Wyzard: oh, sorry, that should be -T, not -i
03:13  rwt: oh
03:13  babilen: Cullz: If it is a very new installation I would either reinstall or install the package from backports. (The recommendation for Squeeze is based on the assumption that we are talking about a desktop/laptop for personal use)

09:12  debianoob: yea i dunno bout that
09:13  debianoob: nokia is awesome
09:13  daemonkeeper: KDE contributes a lot to Nokia, e.g. Webkit originated from KDE (the browser engine used in Konqueror) and Nokia pushes Qt development anyway because they focus on it on their smartphones.
09:14  daemonkeeper: So KDE got Windows portability "for free" for example.

09:18  daemonkeeper: Its a bit bloated though, if you don't use Qt anyway.
09:18  daemonkeeper: (i.e. You don't program KDE apps)
09:18  debianoob: well, if you have one gtk spp you hsv ot losdf gtk
09:19  debianoob: it is tiend and true
09:20  daemonkeeper: Sure, yet GTK is a bit lighter. Just for core UI libs:
09:21  daemonkeeper: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3.9M Sep  5 01:58 /usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0.2000.1
09:21  daemonkeeper: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11M Okt  6 16:09 /usr/lib/libQtGui.so.4.6.3
09:21  daemonkeeper: So GTK has a smaller memory footprint.
09:21  debianoob: lighter, bugs  are what make all gtk and qt load
09:23  debianoob: 'gtk hss smaller mem footprint
09:23  daemonkeeper: Not to forget, that GTK is C, not C++.
09:24  ondrejk: hello, recently i've read that interface aliases are officialy deprecated and it's not possible to use them in iptables. In centos is this really not possible but on debian i have no problem with it. Is this some kind of adjustment for debian?
09:27  jnewt: i need to list the sizes of the "top level" directories and their contents by directory. not du -sh, not du -h
09:28  Dewi: jnewt: du -sh /* ?
09:28  jww: hello.
09:28  Dewi: jnewt: or to avoid the complexities of bash wildcard matching - du -h --max-depth=1 /
09:29  jnewt: Dewi: perfect, thanks
09:31  jnewt: one more thing, if anyone knows.  my tab-completion has stopped on one of my machines.  i get a : <(compgen -d -- 'ho' ): No such file or directory.  it's not the end of the world, but i would like it back.
09:33  K0JIbKA: hello there! asked #clamav but no reply so far... I use clamtk in Debian stable. simply run clamscan in shell executes the scanner. clamtk keeps telling it has 0 signatures in it. following FAQ on the link above by executing http://clamtk.sourceforge.net/faq.html#used_to_update this doesn't solve the problem. how to make clamav run in GNOME using clamtk scanner?
09:37  jww: after an update of a debian server, I got problems with name resolution.tools like ping doesn't use the dns I have in /etc/resolv.conf, but using dig show the dns works fine.any ideas ?
09:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 909]
09:40  jww: sound like it's a problem with /etc/nsswitch.conf . 'dns' entry was after [NOTFOUND=return], moving it before solved the issue.
09:41  jww: but it's not logic since others server have the old entry, and still use the dns.
09:42  CyberDomovoy: how could i list every package with "Priority: required"?
09:43  Dewi: CyberDomovoy: check the aptitude user manual under /usr/share/doc/
