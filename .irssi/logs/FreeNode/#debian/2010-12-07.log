00:27  jhutchins_lt: innerself: I think it's deprecated
00:27  jhutchins_lt: ,versions ndiswrapper
00:27  judd: Sorry, no package named 'ndiswrapper' was found in i386.
00:27  jhutchins_lt: innerself: Most cards have native support these days.
00:28  innerself: ok, its a dlink wireless usb adapter

00:30  stew: innerself: no, it wouldn't come with ndiswrapper, you'd probably have to make a custom installer

00:46  compgenius999: innerself, that's not much help, it's a D-Link wifi adapater connected via USB
00:46  compgenius999: when you get home you need to type "lsusb -v" and pastebin the section for the wifi adapter
00:46  innerself: no problem. thanks for the advice.
00:47  stew: innerself: most likely there is a native linux driver instead of stooping to using a windows driver
00:47  compgenius999: stew, I had a hard time finding a working driver for my card, but eventually I found out that my card happily works with the generic prism54 (p54usb/isl3887usb) module :)

12:52  ragnar_de: hi all
12:52  ttiicc: I love opensource! :D)())
12:53  ragnar_de: i 'm missing the old xmms so i decided to build it by myself but configure is missing GLIB >= 1.2.2 . are there any packages for lenny around (  aptitude gives nothing ) or do i have to build them too?
12:54  valajbeg: acemi, i'll try, thnx althoug it's much much much more slower :(
12:55  petern_: you'd probably have to build glib-1.2 as well, yes
12:55  petern_: hmm, actually there is a libglib1.2-dev
12:55  ragnar_de: petern_: maybe i just need glib-devel ( or such ) but i do not find them
12:56  petern_: well if it exists it's libglib1.2-dev
12:57  petern_: yeah, it's still available on lenny
12:57  ragnar_de: hmmm.... i dont see them
12:57  jelly: ragnar_de: old xmms requires gtk1, which isn't available in Debian
12:58  petern_: i think it's still in lenny
12:58  petern_: i.e. http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=libgtk1.2&searchon=names&suite=stable&section=all
12:59  jelly: hm
12:59  jelly: judd: whatdepends libgtk1.2
12:59  petern_: it's no longer in squeeze though
13:00  jelly: judd: versions libgtk1.2-dev
13:00  judd: Package libgtk1.2-dev on i386 -- etch: 1.2.10-18; lenny: 1.2.10-18.1
13:00  ragnar_de: sounds bad. i dont like huge monsters like xmms2, atunes, amarok. i dont need to manage my music.
13:00  jelly: ragnar_de: install that one.
13:01  ragnar_de: jelly: i dont see it. aptitude gives me 0 packages
13:01  jelly: ragnar_de: which debian release are you using?
13:02  jelly: ragnar_de: pastebin the output of "apt-cache policy", please
13:02  Tommy_DO: What's debians opinion about ext4? Is it stable enough for every purpose? Which filesystem is selected automatically in squeeze's installer?
13:02  ragnar_de: it's squeeze
13:02  petern_: well there you go then. you said lenny earlier :)
13:02  jelly: ragnar_de: so the libs are all gone from squeeze; they old and unmaintained.
13:03  jelly: petern_: no, you said lenny. <g>
13:03  ragnar_de: petern_: i did yes. i had a look in /etc/apt/sources.list a few seconds ago
13:03  ragnar_de: jelly: i did.
13:04  jelly: ok.  my lastlog is incomplete
13:05  ragnar_de: anyway, is it possible to insert old packages?
13:05  ragnar_de: the last debian i have seen is ten years ago on my atari tt. so many things have changed
13:06  jelly: anything is possible with software; the only question is how had it is and whether the costs are lower than the benefits
13:07  acemi: ragnar_de: did you try audacious
13:07  petern_: audacious is probably the most xmms-like
13:08  b52: hey, how can i tell debian to autostart the ntp service after a reboot?
13:08  b52: i need to start it manually every time
13:08  petern_: you even get the same old skin, although branded audacious, not x multimedia system
13:08  ragnar_de: acemi: not yet.
13:10  ragnar_de: audacious looks good so far
13:11  fenugreek: it's actually forked from XMMS
13:11  abrotman: kind of .. not directly
13:12  ragnar_de: fenugreek: so, it might be compatible with xmms plugins?
13:12  fenugreek: it is, at least partially
13:14  ragnar_de: ok, another question.... i have an external usb hdd with an ext3 partition on it. autofs mounts it always readonly and noexec. anyone knows where do i have to change the mounting options?
13:14  fenugreek:  /etc/fstab
13:15  fenugreek: or I guess maybe /etc/auto.misc if you want to use that
13:15  ragnar_de: fenugreek: doesnt work at this point of starting. usb comes later
13:15  Agiofws:  bzip2 headers files how can i check if i have them ?

Now usr2 came along and created a file in that directory, but with umask 077 so that the new file is effectively chmod 600. Is there a way for usr1 to read the contents / take possession of the file created by usr2? As far as I've tried, all he can do is delete it.

14:07  don_martino: Hi I have a new Squeeze installation here. My problem is I cannot access Services locally. For example "ssh localhost" "ssh 127.0.0.1" don't work (same with wget and telnet on all those ports). But I can access these serives form another computer. It just wont work locally. Can anybody help me find out why that is?
14:07  abrotman: unixtippse: the original owner can chmod it
14:08  petemc: don_martino: does ifconfig show lo
14:09  unixtippse: abrotman, yes, I know. :-) If he had a frickin clue, he's possibly just change the umask to 022 in the script that creates the file.... Stupid cookbook "hardening" here.
14:09  don_martino: petemc: I just remembered. lo is down by default in squeeze .... knew i heared of this before
14:09  don_martino: petemc: it works now. thanks for reminding me again
14:09  petemc: any squeeze installs i have have a loopback interface which i didnt need to add manuallt
14:10  don_martino: petemc: well it's there i just need to up it. but i bootstraped it. maybe i have to write the network settings myself then
14:12  petemc: yes, if you use debootstrap you have to do some manual setup
14:12  petemc: thats not specific to squeeze either
14:13  don_martino: petemc: ok then it's a bootstrap issue. i fixed it permanetly now
14:13  hkuieagle: Hi room, when I want to remove gnome-games, it wants me to remove gnome as well! Does that matters?

14:29  HackeMate: I saw it could be possible compiling manually something
14:29  HackeMate: but I won't experiment that
14:34  ragnar_de: HackeMate: i have a small barebone which is very similar to a laptop. i dont have any problems so far.
14:34  mrtnt: Am I correct, that if I'm running "OpenSSH 3.5p1 (protocol 1.99)" in the server using the key-based authentication, then I need to place id_rsa.pub(ssh-keygen -t rsa1 because it's SSH version 1.99) into server, not the identity.pub?
14:35  ragnar_de: HackeMate: ok, i have noc webcam or wlan but my guess is that it would work
14:35  HackeMate: it should be a laptop
14:35  HackeMate: is not for me

14:57  hkuieagle: hi,how can I manage start-up services on debian?
14:57  bonjoyee: hkuieagle: what version?
14:58  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: squeeze
14:58  bonjoyee: did u install upstart?
14:58  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: no
14:59  bonjoyee: if not then "services-admin" as root should work
14:59  stew: hkuieagle: update-rc.d / rcconf / sysv-rc-conf
15:00  babilen: hkuieagle: What do you mean by manage? If you want to disable/enable certain services have a look at: update-rc.d , rcconf and ... gah stew! :)
15:00  stew: gah babilen!
15:00  xro: is there a difference between "gzip -d  myfile" and "gunzip myfile" ?
15:01  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: well, It's  "services-admin" that confuses me! Does it do the same job as update-rc.d?
15:02  stew: hkuieagle: all the others should be frontends for update-rc.d which does the actual work
15:02  bonjoyee: it certainly enables/disables them..but update-rc.d gives much more control
15:02  babilen: xro: Take a look at "gunzip" it basically does "exec gzip -d "$@" -- so no, no difference
15:02  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: I didn't see any options of runlevels to be choosen on services-admin
15:02  bonjoyee: they are there..just check more carefully
15:03  bonjoyee: right-click and properties..
15:04  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: er... It's too covert
15:04  bonjoyee: hkuieagle: i am using squeeze as well..its surely there...
15:05  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: yeah, I found it
15:05  abrotman: covert ?
15:06  bonjoyee:  hkuieagle: but not all startup services are listed in there..u need to use update-rc.d for those
15:06  hkuieagle: bonjoyee: and I can't "manage" with services-admin, all I can do is just to enable/disable
15:07  bonjoyee: what so u mean by manage?
15:07  bonjoyee: do
15:07  babilen: hkuieagle: What are you trying to do? Is sysv-rc-conf or update-rc.d not what you are looking for?
15:08  hkuieagle: babilen: no, update-rc.d is enough, I just wonder if services-admin and update-rc.d use the same mechanism.
15:09  babilen: hkuieagle: What is "services-admin" ?
15:09  bonjoyee: babilen:gui to update-rc.d i believe?
15:10  Agiofws: hello
15:10  stew: hkuieagle: they all should be using update-rc.d (which has different implementations in debian depending on which init system you use)
15:11  Agiofws: i am upgrading from lenny to squeeze but it seems that i do not have enough space on my root folder for the upgrade tp take place ... should i stop the upgrade and resize my partion via a live disk ? ; or can i do it with my partition mounted ? or generally what should i do ?
15:11  hkuieagle: stew: by saying init system you mean stuffs like "sysV style" and "upstart"?
15:11  Agiofws: /dev/sda5              14G   13G  275M  98% /
15:12  xro: babilen, and can you explain me why when i do a "gzip -d myFile.gz" i get a error (unexpected end of file) and when i use zcat i can read the file?
15:13  flypp: xro, missing EOF in myFile.gz?
15:13  xro: flypp, yes (i get unexpected end of file)
15:13  Agiofws: anyone ?
15:14  babilen: xro: I assume that gunzip behaves like "gzip -d" -- zcat behaves like gzip -c and just dumps everything that has been decoded so far to stdout
15:14  xro: flypp, but when i use zcat to read the file, data seems to be correct
15:14  stew: hkuieagle: yes, but I don't know about upstart.  certainly sysv, file-rc, insserv
15:15  xro: flypp, it's a real big file (50 Go compressed and more 200 Go uncompressed)
15:15  xro: flypp, do you know this problem (i hope yes and also you know how to do)
15:16  flypp: xro, zcat search reads line by line (searching for ends of line). Seems like that file has end of lines, but no end of file especial character
15:16  hkuieagle: stew: me too, the only one I know is sysV. I'm confused by so much init systems
15:16  xro: flypp, is that possible?
15:16  Agiofws: i am upgrading from lenny to squeeze but it seems that i do not have enough space on my root folder for the upgrade tp take place ... should i stop the upgrade and resize my partion via a live disk ? ; or can i do it with my partition mounted ? or generally what should i do ?
15:17  Agiofws: if i interrupt the upgrade process will i be able to boot my machine ?
15:18  xro: flypp, and how add a EOF to a gz file?
15:18  bonjoyee: Agiofws: you could download the upgrade packages to some other location
15:19  bonjoyee: and update it from there
15:19  acemi: Agiofws: you can delete the old debs file
15:19  Agiofws: how ?
15:19  xro: if i get an error with "gzip -d" (unexpected end of file)... do you think that "zcat myfile.gz > myfile" could work?
15:19  Agiofws: i have laready issued    aptitude full upgrade  ?
15:19  Agiofws: aptitude full-upgrade
15:20  DarkUranium: o/
15:20  bonjoyee: Agiofws:hmm...

15:20  Agiofws: yes
15:20  acemi: then you can stop it
15:20  bonjoyee: yes if its sill downloading..then u shud be able to cancel it safely..

15:26  babilen: lunarmys: You should use one of the weeklies and I never ran into that problem in expert mode. Haven't used the "normal" install in ages, so don't know if that is different.
15:26  bonjoyee: Agiofws:you could generate download links for the upgrade packages..download them to another location..and then create symlinks to those packages in /var/cache/apt/archives..
15:26  lunarmys: babilen: will try expert mode, thanks!

15:29  flypp: try it, i've made a test and it worked
15:29  babilen: lunarmys: Choose "Manual Partitioning" and make sure that you don't create filesystems on (some) of your partitions. There is a flag for that, but it escapes me right now what it is called. You just want to assign a mountpoint to them.
15:29  bonjoyee: Agiofws:one way to do this...synaptic>mark all upgrades>generate download links>then download those files using aria2c
15:29  xro: flypp, ok... i try... a gzip -tv will check it
15:30  bonjoyee: Agiofws:this way u wont have to download the packages u already have
15:30  Agiofws: i don;t have synaptic installed
15:30  flypp: xro, http://pastebin.com/ffQ5tbD9 << my test
15:30  Rug: Howdy all.
15:31  babilen: Agiofws: Please read the release notes. There are a couple of things in there that are important. (e.g. use apt-get for the upgrade) -- http://www.debian.org/releases/squeeze/releasenotes
15:31  stew: Agiofws: it would also tell you how to check if you have enough disk space and give several suggestions about what to do if you don't
15:33  xro: flypp, but your file wasn't corrupt befor?
15:33  flypp: nope
15:33  DarkUranium: hey guys, I've a question
15:33  bonjoyee: Agiofws:then u could also move /var/cache/apt/archive folder to a location where there is space and create a symlink to it in /var/cache/apt/
15:34  Rug: I am looking for guidance here and/or some suggestions.  I want to script a way to do the folloowing:  receive RSS feeds then email the headlines only to a specific address.  I don't want to just 'subscribe' at the target location.  I don't want to just 'forward' the entire rss message (which usually includes a summary).  Just the headline only.  Any suggestions?
15:34  DarkUranium: I have a vserver setup in Debian -- the host machine can be accessed on mutliple IPs (say, 111.111.111.111 and a subnet 123.123.123.123/29)
15:34  DarkUranium: how could I forward the subnet to the vserver?
15:34  DarkUranium: right now, all the IPs point to the "host" server (say, if I go to 123.123.123.123:80, it brings up the 111.111.111.111:80 apache server)
15:35  DarkUranium: (as in, the host machine's server)
15:39  bonjoyee: Agiofws:there could be more "professional" ways of doing this..what i am suggesting is just for the worst case scenario
15:39  stew: bonjoyee: (the Dir::Cache entry in apt.conf)
15:40  bonjoyee: stew:yeah..but that will download all packages again..isn't it?

15:40  stew: Agiofws: this is one of the reasons we are suggesting following the release notes
15:41  Agiofws: can i download the packages onto a usb stick and then install them from there
15:41  stew: Agiofws: also that you should NOT be starting with full-upgrade
15:41  Agiofws: i am reading them
15:41  Agiofws: it is
15:41  stew: Agiofws: just deciding not to follow them?
15:41  Agiofws: i am
15:41  stew: Agiofws: what command gave you that "Try harder" prompt?
15:41  Agiofws: aptitude full upgrade
15:42  abrotman: There is no try ...
15:42  stew: Agiofws: what section of the release notes tells you to do that?
15:42  Agiofws: hmmm you are right ...
15:42  stew: Agiofws: section 4.5 specificall tells you not to use aptitude, and nowhere does it tell you to do full-upgrade
15:42  Agiofws: ok right
15:43  Agiofws: so i am stopping it i was waiting for it to resolvethe deps though
15:43  stew: Agiofws: what part of the upgrade are you on?
15:43  Agiofws: was following this
15:44  Agiofws: http://www.go2linux.org/how-to-upgrade-from-debian-lenny-to-squeeze
15:44  stew: Agiofws: i mean in the release notes
15:44  Agiofws: but now am reading the release notes
15:44  Agiofws: chapter 4
15:44  flypp: xro, you said that zgrep works? had you tried to do: zcat myFile.gz >> Test.txt ? (or zcat myFile.gz | gzip > Test.gz)
15:44  stew: so he was just lying before
15:44  Agiofws: no i don't lie
15:45  Agiofws: let me see if i have the right space  first of all
15:45  stew: Agiofws: well, you were telling us that you were reading and following the release notes when you weren't...
15:46  xro: flypp, yes zcat myFile.gz >> myFile is my next idea... (do you think it could work?)
15:46  Agiofws: i am now
15:46  Agiofws: After this operation, 2,004 MB of additional disk space will be used.
15:46  Agiofws: i was just combining them
15:46  Agiofws: and i have
15:46  Agiofws: Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
15:46  Agiofws: /dev/sda5              14G   12G  2.0G  85% /
15:47  flypp: xro, try: zcat myFile.gz 2> /dev/null | gzip > myFile2.gz
15:48  flypp: then compare the size of the 2 files
15:50  xro: flypp, but i nedd to use the file.... so i need it uncompressed (zcat myFile.gz >> myfile)
15:50  superlinux: hi

15:52  superlinux: I know how to add them only
15:53  babilen: Agiofws: You might also want to find out what exactly is occupying so much space on your system. I found tools like baobab to be quite helpful with that.
15:53  superlinux: well, how can I change the order of execution in a gnome session once I logon?

16:05  JPT: i use a vanilla kernel on debian at home
16:06  OpenTokix: Agiofws: I dont understand your question
16:07  Agiofws: kernel.org
16:07  OpenTokix: oh
16:07  Agiofws: does anyone in here use a vanilla kernel instead of A a debian kernel ?
16:07  OpenTokix: no, I do not on any system
16:08  Agiofws: stew,  i issued apt-get upgrade at first to do a minimal upgrade for starters
16:08  OpenTokix: Have done before on a workstation, and it was very simple
16:08  Agiofws: why not ?
16:08  OpenTokix: Agiofws: it's not worth it
16:08  Agiofws: why not ?
16:08  OpenTokix: To much hassle, benefit is very low
16:09  Agiofws: you produce a kernel though configured for YOUR system
16:09  OpenTokix: Agiofws: Well.. I don't see a huge win in that. Havent see a huge improvement
16:10  Agiofws: well you occupy less ram due to a stripped down kernel to your own needs ?
16:10 --- the-dude_ is now known as the-dude
16:10  OpenTokix: Agiofws: in theory yes, but the actual real life thing, unless embedded is... minor.
16:11  acemi: Agiofws: and you'll not get the kernel updates if you use your custom kernel
16:12  Agiofws: you can just upgrade your kernel though
16:12  bonjoyee: Agiofws:whats the status of full-upgrade?
16:13  Agiofws: bonjoyee,  i am doing Just  an upgrade for starters
16:13  Agiofws: apt-get upgrade
16:13  bonjoyee: Agiofws:and space management?
16:13  Agiofws: minimal  and then i will check for a full one
16:13  Agiofws: Need to get 411 MB/531 MB of archives.
16:13  Agiofws: After this operation, 198 MB of additional disk space will be used.
16:14  bonjoyee:  Agiofws:good luck..and i think the solution i gave seems to be listed in the release notes as well:)
16:15  Agiofws: can someone use both a debian kernel and a vanilla kernel in grub ?
16:15  Agiofws: bonjoyee,  off course ...
16:16  JPT: nah, grub is just a funny frontend that allows you to choose the only system available
16:16  acemi: Agiofws: will you do full-upgrade after apt-get upgrade?
16:17  stew: acemi: hopefully not
16:17  Agiofws: acemi,  if the space permits me too
16:17  Agiofws: stew,  why not ?
16:17  stew: Agiofws: because you'd hopefully be following the procedure in the release notes instead
16:17  acemi: Agiofws: didn't you check the upgarde notes?
16:17  Agiofws: JPT,  off course you can select kernels in grub
16:17  JPT: :]
16:18  Agiofws: i did
16:18  JPT: i can also put my wintendo into the list ;)
16:18  Agiofws: stew,  whats the benefit of a  debian kernel ?
16:18  acemi: Agiofws: if you check, you will not do that
16:19  Agiofws: not do what ? acemi  ?
16:19  stew: Agiofws: works on a wide variety of systems, easy to upgrade, easier to get security fixes
16:19  acemi: full-upgrade
16:19  acemi: there are some more steps befure this
16:20  xuser: Agiofws: you compile your custom kernel as debian package
16:20  xuser: if you want
16:20  Agiofws: before full upgrade ?
16:21  acemi: yes
16:21  Agiofws: 4.5.4. Minimal system upgrade : 4.5.5. Upgrading the kernel and udev : 4.5.6. Upgrading the system
16:21  Agiofws: but i use my own kernel
16:21  acemi: you can switch your own kernel after upgrade
16:22  Agiofws: i have never used a debian kernel before and i don't know how to install it
16:22  Muncuie:  kontol
16:23  stew: luckly the instructions you are following tell you how to install it!
16:24  Agiofws: do i need to  edit apt-sources.list ?
16:24  Agiofws: sources.list ?
16:24  stew: Agiofws: you did that in step 4.4
16:25  Agiofws: deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian squeeze main contrib  i dont have that line in the file
16:25  Agiofws: never used a debian kernel
16:25  Booumbo: mi?

16:26  Booumbo: mi
16:26  Booumbo: ubunto ban me
16:26  Agiofws: i don;t have naything thats refers to a kernel
16:26  Booumbo: mi
16:27  niko: Booumbo: if you have a debian question, feel free to ask.
16:27  stew: Agiofws: you don't need anything referring to a kernel, the "kernel.org" just happens to be a debian mirror, its not any different than any other debian mirror
16:27  Booumbo: niko if you have a mandrake question

16:46  stew: xro: i don't know how you would know that without the original

17:46  Bartzy: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianAMD64Faq - In here it says the best bet would be to use 32-bit flash player with some ia32 packages.. but I would rather use adobe's 64-bit new version...

17:47  DotHack: Anyone able to install Squeeze in XenServer 5.6?

17:48  Bartzy: babilen: It won't work in firefox.
17:48  AlexC_: morning
17:49  AlexC_: can you have too much entropy? I had an issue whereby I had very little, so I installed 'rng-tools' and configured it to use /dev/urandom as a source. After installing it, requests to Apache on this server were very very slow, but disabling it sped them back up. What could be the issue?
17:49  macrobat: dpkg tells me that the flashplugin-nonfree pkg wont keep updated
17:49  babilen: Bartzy: I can assure you that it does :) There must be something wrong with your setup then. Do you have any old manual installations around? What does "about:plugins" say about Shockwave Flash -- You should have Shockwave Flash 10.2 d161
17:49  babilen: macrobat: Which factoid is that?
17:50  Bartzy: babilen: I downloaded firefox today from getfirefox.com (I don't want to use Iceweasel)
17:50  macrobat: babilen: "adobe flash"
17:50  babilen: Bartzy: That might be a problem. One second please
17:50  Bartzy: about:plugins doesn't show any plugins... :|
17:51  babilen: macrobat: Thanks for that, I wasn't aware of that. But now that I consider how it works it is quite logical. :-\

17:52  babilen: Bartzy: What is wrong with iceweasel?
17:52  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: iceweasel IS firefox.
17:52  macrobat: idk, maybe firefox need newer _other_ libraries to work right?
17:53  jhutchins_lt: macrobat: No.

17:53  macrobat: i was thinking about how iceweasel is a few versions behind
17:53  Bartzy: babilen, jhutchins_lt: Iceweasel was v3.5.... I wanted firefox 3.6
17:54  Bartzy: babilen, jhutchins_lt: Installing firefox 3.6.12 from experimental is fine ?
17:54  themill: Bartzy: You've spent most of the day getting other people to do lots of work for you when "aptitude install iceweasel" would just work. If you want to use things outside of debian, perhaps you should ask the people that make them rather than us.
17:54  Bartzy: firefox=iceweasel
17:55  Bartzy: themill: I explained my problem. Iceweasel version is 3.5. 3.6 is much better. Firebug works in 3.6 but not in 3.5.
17:55  stew: firebug works for me in iceweasel from squeeze
17:55  babilen: Bartzy: I completely agree with themill and installing iceweasel from experimental might pull in a newer xulrunner and I remember to read about some problems with that on d-d. Can't be more specific about the details right now though
17:57  stew: Bartzy: what problem do you have with firebug in 3.5.  it works well for me
17:57  Bartzy: stew: I just wasn't able to install it via the addons window in iceweasel...
17:57  Bartzy: and the addons website said it was for 3.6 +
17:58  sisif: hmm, do you guys know what might be the best driver for a ati HD2400? Right now I`m using radeon one and maaan, each piece of Flash is killing my CPU. Does anyone recomends somthing else? (as in driver)

17:58  babilen: Bartzy: There is xul-ext-firebug
17:58  Bartzy: oh.
17:59  babilen: Bartzy: It might be related to the fact that iceweasel 3.5 depends on xulrunner 1.9.1 while 3.6 depends on xulrunner 1.9.2
17:59  Bartzy: ok..
18:00  babilen: Bartzy: Please "aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree iceweasel xul-ext-firebug" and you are done. If you want help with newer versions from upstream, go there and ask them (→ #firefox / #mozilla)

18:02  babilen: Bartzy: But installing it from within iceweasel shouldn't be a problem. It might just be that your firefox 3.6 chokes on xulrunner-1.9.1 -- But I don't know enough about the packaging to be certain about it.

18:03  babilen: yes, please
18:03  stew: Agiofws: yes, that was the point of rebooting
18:03  Agiofws: is it logical that /var/log/messages are empty ?
18:04  thewanderer1: sure, one logical explanation is that no syslog daemon is running, the other one being a rootkit...

18:13  Phil-Work: jhutchins_lt, remove the `s
18:13  stew: Bartzy: "update-alternatives --config x-www-browser" selecting one will set the link to "manual" instead of "automatic" and ignore the priorities

18:14  Bartzy: stew: Yeah, I was just asking how to change the priority (so it'll be auto), because I didn't succeed :)(
18:14  stew: Bartzy: you can look at how the alternative is installed in the postinst script for the package, note that you'll have to adjust it any time the package is upgraded

18:18  jhutchins_lt: Agiofws: udev messages should be in dmesg too.
18:19  stew: Agiofws: looks like everything is working to me.  I'd continue with the upgrade
18:20  stew: Agiofws: if you were previously using some non-free kernel driver for your graphics card, you'd have to add that to this kernel as well
18:20  jhutchins_lt: Agiofws: All I can tell from your screenshot is that your virtual desktop may be larger than your actual desktop.
18:20  babilen:  Agiofws And it might also be a problem with your old xfce configuration. They should be somewhere in ~/.config -- I would move them somewhere else and have a look again. (e.g. "mv ~/.config/xfce{,_bkp}"
18:20  tharkun: Gentlemen, Sorry to bother I need a lightweight alternative to gnome. Any suggestions?
18:21  jhutchins_lt: tharkun: xfce's pretty popular.  http://freedesktop.org is definitive.
18:22  tharkun: jhutchins_lt: thx for the link

18:22  babilen: Agiofws: Ah, you haven't upgraded completely yet?

18:22  babilen: tharkun: Have a look at the first three then
18:22  stew: babilen: no, he's done apt-get upgrade, the kenrel + udev and reboot
18:23  babilen: stew: Ah, I've been out of the loop for a while and thought that Agiofws might be done by now.
18:23  tharkun: babilen: writing them down thx

18:24  atula: I was trying to install ntfs-3g a while back and I think it installed fuse utils as well... I figure since I don't need that anymore, perhaps I could safely remove it. do I need fuse at all ?
18:24  tharkun: babilen: lxde is having some isues to open a window. It has to be manually done. It was indeed my first option
18:25  atula: I am tempted to just apt-get --purge remove fuse-utils
18:26  babilen: tharkun: *shrug* #lxde might know how to solve that :-\

18:29  cyryczy: is it a problem?
18:29  babilen: cyryczy: Don't add an .xsession then, but add the program to "autostart" (somewhere in the session config) -- .xsession has to be selected as session in gdm, but that won't start Gnome.

19:06  stew: latenite: http://packages.debian.org/packagename would list it as being available from a "lenny-backports" dist
19:06  babilen: zeitsofa: Note the "this package is only useful with a corresponding xtables-addons-modules package ..." in the package description. You might want to read the README.Debian that comes with that package.
19:07  babilen: latenite: I checked, it is not available on backports
19:07  zeitsofa: babilen: ok. thx for the hint
19:07  babilen: latenite: Hence the recommendation to backport it yourself. The factoid just mentions backports to make sure that you are not backporting a package that is already available on bdo
19:08  babilen: zeitsofa: I should also note that the package is not available in lenny
19:09  zeitsofa: babilen: i'm using squezze on the system i would use it.
19:09  latenite: babilen, do I add sid or squize to the sources list ?
19:11  DarkUranium: anyone here know a thing or two about debian vservers?
19:12  babilen: latenite: Please, give me a second.
19:12  latenite: babilen, how do I enable debian-backports ? (step 2 drom dpkg)
19:12  stew: latenite: see the instructions page at http://backports.debian.org
19:12  jhutchins_lt: !tell latenite about bdo
19:13  babilen: latenite: I just want to tell you that mongodb might be quite hard to backport as the dependencies are, well, quite large. (mongodb-server, mongodb-client, bunch of libs and everyhting)
19:13  jhutchins_lt: latenite: /msg judd versions <package> will also show if there is a backport available.
19:14  babilen: latenite: And a lot of its dependencies are also not available on Lenny. (The whole libboost- ones for example)
19:14  latenite: babilen, so I add "deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main" also to my sourecs list? BUT did n you say there was no backport available? why am a enabling it then?
19:15  latenite: can I just updgrade to squeeze somehow?
19:15  stew: latenite: there isn't a backport available, however, in this case, if you try to backport it yourself, i believe you may need some other packages from backports in order to build it
19:15  babilen: latenite: You enable it in order to be able to install (build) dependencies that *are* available from bdo
19:15  latenite: babilen, ahh ok makes sense :)
19:16  latenite: well I d rather upgrade my websevrer to squeeze. Isn that better anyway?
19:16  babilen: latenite: Sure, upgrading to Squeeze is possible. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a webserver as it does not yet has security support like Lenny
19:16  stew: latenite: no, since there isn't guaranteed security support for squeeze
19:17  latenite: If i wanted to upgrade. How woudl I do it?
19:17  jhutchins_lt: latenite: There are also some critical bugs that prevent squeeze from working properly in some cases.
19:17  jhutchins_lt: latenite: I would recommend installing it to a seperate partition as a boot option.
19:18  jhutchins_lt: latenite: You could copy your existing installation and then upgrade it too.
19:18  latenite: So what you are saing is "if you want mongodb (diaspora)" on your webserver...debian is not the best choice??
19:18  jhutchins_lt: latenite: That way you can boot back to Lenny when squeeze breaks.
19:18  latenite: jhujhiti, it is a lxc so easy to copy
19:18  satskiy: hi a have integrated intel i845 --- X  server crashes like  zebra   ! !  HELP
19:19  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: squeeze?
19:19  babilen: latenite: I am not sure what to recommend now. Give me a second please.
19:19  satskiy: yes
19:19  babilen: satskiy: And the x server just shows black and white stripes?
19:19  latenite: jhujhiti, just copied the container. so I can go back to lenny just in case.
19:19  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: Works fine in lenny.
19:19  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: Known issue in squeeze.
19:20  babilen: jhutchins_lt: bug report handy?
19:20  satskiy: And the x server just shows black and white stripes!!!!
19:20  jhutchins_lt: babilen: Not handy, no, the laptop with the 855Gm lost it's hard drive.  We get regular queries here though.
19:20  satskiy: how to fix
19:21  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: revert to lenny, wait for updated kernel & xorg intel driver.
19:21  satskiy: jhutchins_lt: can i fix it of need downgrade
19:21  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: Earlier versions of the problem could be tinkered with by disabling kms, but the current intel driver in squeeze requires a framebuffer.
19:22  jhutchins_lt: at least last I checked it did.
19:22  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: I do not know of a current fix.
19:22  jhutchins_lt: That's not to say there isn't one, you can search the bugreports.
19:23  jhutchins_lt: satskiy: There are also ongoing discussions in the forums.
19:23  satskiy: where is
19:23  stew: satskiy: try xserver-xorg-video-intel from unstable.  its had multiple uploads this week that are supposed to fix a bunch of things that might make the server hang
19:23  babilen: latenite: I would try backporting mongodb from squeeze. Might be a lot of work, but it'll pay off for a production system. I really wouldn't recommend running Squeeze on a web facing server.
19:24  jhutchins_lt: Or you could just run lenny whch, you know, just works.
19:25  babilen: latenite: Sorry for the inconvenience, but it'll be better once Squeeze is released. Another idea would be to install Squeeze on a different machine/in a vm and only offer services locally. You could also ditch Debian and use, for example, Ubuntu.
19:25 * DarkUranium twitches
19:25  latenite: babilen, honestly, without starting flamewars. If I was to put a lot of effort into my existing webserver at all. I d rather go for something else then debian. I love it...but at the same time I feel others give me more freedom
19:26  DarkUranium: er... vserver help, anyone? =/
19:27  babilen: latenite: Hence my last suggestion. I don't want to make life hard for you. You could run squeeze as well, but it doesn't give you the security support you receive with Lenny. I am just telling you about your options.
19:27  latenite: might be the wrong place to ask. But which distro is a gowd webserver base? the ones I worked with are(gentoo, debian, ubunutu,arch)
19:28  latenite: babilen, I know and I am very thankfull for ou letting me know :)
19:28  babilen: latenite: And I am OTOH not sure how Squeeze security compares to Arch, Ubuntu or Gentoo :)
19:28  latenite: is arch a system one would want to use for a webserver?
19:29  stew: if we didn't have the new source pacakge formats in debian, squeeze would have security support by now, its unfortunate
19:29  babilen: latenite: I guess that I would rather run squeeze than arch or gentoo, but I haven't read a good comparison of the security support offered by different distributions.
19:30  babilen: latenite: And I am just not going to recommend something that doesn't has good security support for a internet facing production machine.
19:32  latenite: babilen, thas makes sense. So what is secure? cent os?
19:32  babilen: latenite: But I would at least try to backport it. I am sure that compiling gentoo or installing Arch will be much more work. Unfortunate though if it does not work out... (but it just might, haven't seen any real problematic dependencies, just a bunch of them, but haven't resolved the whole dependency graph)
19:32  orfix: Hi, i just installed debian on an external USB hard drive, but couldn't get my laptop to boot from it, it's not recognized by my BIOS (which support USB boot), i also tried to do it manually from grub when i type "root (hd1,0)" i get an error message : Cannot get C/H/S values. help please :) thanks
19:32  jhutchins_lt: latenite: Debian stable is among the most securable.
19:33  jhutchins_lt: latenite: NOTHING is inherently "secure".
19:33  GNU\colossus: jhutchins_lt, a powered down box is ;)
19:34  stew: latenite: wait, you are worried about the security of a webserver that you are going to run diaspora on?  isn't that thing known to be full of security problems?
19:34  jhutchins_lt: GNU\colossus: Except that it can be powered up.
19:35  GNU\colossus: jhutchins_lt, but that'd be an ugly hack...
19:35  babilen: stew: *we* are worried about security for lenny on a webserver. AFAICT latenite is rather interested in getting mongodb to work on whatever is the most stable distribution.
19:35  latenite: stew, I have anoterh idea. I sit possibe to run 2 ore more webservers (of different kind and services) for one domain?
19:35  latenite: babilen, "word"
19:35  latenite: :)
19:36  babilen: word?
19:38  latenite: babilen, word = you said it just like I would !
19:38  babilen: I think i'll stick to my initial suggestion: try to backport it first. Then look for alternatives. You know your options now. :) Backporting is detailed in the dpkg factoid, upgrading to Squeeze in the release notes and I guess you know where to find installation instructions for whatever distribution you want to install.
19:38  latenite: babilen, found a way to get lenny and mongodb http://pastebin.com/G6Gj820k
19:38  latenite: :)
19:39  latenite: happy now :) but I will think about a new distro anyway
19:39  orfix: when i boot from my regular drive, i can mount and unmount paritition from the external USB hard drive, here is the fdisk -l output http://debian.pastebin.com/yrjkZMsk
19:40  babilen: latenite: they backported it. So it is definitely possible. I would still run Debian's version. Good that you are happy now, and have fun with whatever distro you choose.
19:41  latenite: babilen, you know how lazy one get if all works just fine...so maybe in summer :) thanks a lot for you help :)

22:45  jelly-home: pittstains: (also implied, "don't forget to make your script a /bin/bash script, not /bin/sh script")
22:45  pittstains: jelly-home: yes, i believe it is, but bash is the only environment I'm familiar with, so i may be wrong
22:45  dutchfish: K-Lighter: have yo configured your locales properly? dpkg-reconfigure locales
22:45  pittstains: on my system, /bin/sh is a symlink to /bin/bash

22:45  K-Lighter: dutchfish; tried that - no positive result
22:49  lenswipe: hey guys
22:49  jelly-home: jpinx-eeepc: a) there really is no /bin/sh inside the chroot; b) the dynamic loader required to run that /bin/sh is missing (/lib/ld-linux.so.2) or c) the kernel currently running cannot execute that binary since it's a different architecture; I believe c) results in a slightly different message

23:21  stew: andreas122: how do you login to debian?  via a graphical login?  via text and then "startx" ?
23:21  stew: stuckey: you need to be in the directory containing the debian directory, not the debian directory itself
23:21  stew: stuckey: and in the directory above that should be the .orig.tar.gz
23:21 * tharkun toast to the patience of stew
23:21  stuckey: stew: does it need to have any special name? (the oringal tar)
23:21  stew: stuckey: note that debian policy requires pacakge names to be all lowercase, but I'm guessing you might not care
23:21  stew: tharkun: with jam please
23:21  stew: stuckey: yes, it needs to be packagename_version.orig.tar.gz
23:21  andreas122: with startx

23:22  ragnar_de: andreas122: yes
23:23  stew: stuckey: the first line of debian/changelog would be "packagename (version) dist; urgency
23:24  andreas122: this is a folder? becouse i cant see somethink like that in the filemanager (i can see hidden files).
23:24  stew: stuckey: and the pacakgename should match the first line of debian/control as "Source: packagename"
23:24  ragnar_de: andreas122: it's a file
23:24  ragnar_de: andreas122: if you dont have it, create it
23:24  stew: andreas122: no, its a shell script which is executed when you 'startx', when the script completes, X shuts down.  so likely you want the last line of the script to be something like "exec fluxbox"
23:25  stuckey: stew: That did it! Now, pdebuild wants root, and when I give it, it says stuckey isn't in the suders file.
23:25  andreas122: it is the: .Xauthority ?
23:26  stew: stuckey: "when I give it" ?
23:26  ragnar_de: andreas122: no, .xsession or .xsession
23:26  stew: andreas122: no, .Xauthority is somehting else
23:26  stuckey: (the root password)
23:27  andreas122: i have only this file: .xsession-errors
23:27  andreas122: is the right?
23:27  ragnar_de: andreas122: nope
23:28  stuckey: stew: the root password, it says I'm not in the suderos file.
