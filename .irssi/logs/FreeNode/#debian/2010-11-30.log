08:50  yagoo: is (uname -r == 2.6.26-1-686) from linux-source-2.6.26 ?
08:54  Iridos: ?
09:06  WormFood: do we get a new "testing" branch, after squeeze is moved to "stable"?
09:07 --- crashev_ is now known as crashev
09:11 --- MortenTemp is now known as Morten_
09:13  yagoo: WormFood, I'll reword the help Iridos gives. Thank him. "?"
09:13  yagoo: LOL
09:18  Iridos: I understood HIS question!
09:18  Iridos: WormFood, yes, it'll be called "wheezy" to my disappointment
09:18  WormFood: I thought it was clear
09:18  WormFood: how does the move from old testing to new testing work? is it just a fork after it is moved to stable?
09:18  WormFood: *after squeeze is moved to stable
09:19  Iridos: blahdeblah, usbmount, at least for usb drives... and not sure about using volume names, I guess not impossible if you read up a bit
09:20  Iridos: WormFood, it just goes on... right now squeeze is frozen... at one point it moves to become stable and new stuff will start again flowing in from unstable
09:20  WormFood: yeah, I agree with you on that one Iridos, I think "wheezy" is a terrible name...reminds me of the old TeeVee show "The Jeffersons"
09:22  Iridos: WormFood, new things always get into unstable first, they stay there, say, about 10 days and then are moved into testing when no bugs were found in that time that prevents them (or they can depend on things that can't move from unstable to testing, then they also have to stay in unstable)
09:22  WormFood: ok, that is cool...i understand what is going on now. Thanks for your explanation.
09:23  Iridos: right now, testing is frozen, that means no new versions of software are supposed to go into testing, just bugfixes... when squeeze is released as stable, the freeze just stops and everything continues like before
09:23  WormFood: so those of us that are running squeeze, will eventually automatically move to stable, and if we want to upgrade to the new testing (when it is out), we just update our apt sources, and continue on like normal, is that right?
09:25  Iridos: if they use the name "squeeze" in /etc/apt/sources.list, they will move to stable... if they use the name "testing", they keep moving on... testing is a softlink on the ftp-servers to whatever testing currently is
09:26  WormFood: ok, so in my sources list, I can just replace "squeeze" with "testing" then, and I'll continue to stay in testing, after the move to stable, right?
09:26  Iridos: yes
09:26  Iridos: I wouldn't do that, though...
09:27  Iridos: now new versions are held back... when stable releases all the new stuff keeps flowing in with lots of new bugs
09:27  Iridos: but of course, if you run testing you enjoy debugging :-P
09:28  WormFood: I'm used to bugs...I run unstable on my laptop....I EXPECT to fix things if I don't update/upgrade for a month on testing.
09:28  Iridos: well, lots of opportunities for that after a release of stable...
09:29  Iridos: because right now even unstable doesn't get new versions of things to keep the way free for potential bugfixes to go through testing
09:29  Iridos: err, thgough unstable*
09:29  WormFood: I would like to see one thing "fixed" in the next branch....which is just a config file setting.
09:29  Iridos: write a bugreport...
09:29  WormFood: that is interesting, I hadn't heard that before.
09:30  Iridos: still time to get fixes into squeeze....
09:30  WormFood: there is no way to file a bugreport without an email address....I use a different email address everywhere, and I don't want to setup another email address just to file a bug.
09:30  Mowee: Hello ^^
09:31  WormFood: I probably should tho, since I've found a few things that should have bug reports filed on.
09:31  Iridos: WormFood, I use spamgourmet.com... and a different address each time... trivial to use a new address with it
09:31  squeeze: I want to have 80x25 text mode on squeeze. It´s a netbook with 1024x600 pixel. How do I get that?
09:32  WormFood: yeah, but I run my own email server....getting mail is trivial, because I have a semi-catch-all address, but for sending email I have to setup another email address
09:32  Iridos: I wish the bugtracking system wouldn't publish emails in plain easy-to-parse text, though... I can't imagine spam to those addresses is very successful, but there's always someone trying
09:32  WormFood: yeah, I should do this, because this configuration they have as a default is incredibly fuckin' stupid!
09:33  Iridos: amazing, the amount of million-dollar-wins I had after the couple of bug-reports I submitted recently
09:33  WormFood: hahaha
09:33  Iridos: well, the good thing with the spamgourmet addresses is that they automatically expire after n<20 emails received
09:33  WormFood: there is also other email services like that.
09:34  Iridos: isn't 80x25 the default text mode?
09:34  squeeze: that was in lenny, not now
09:34  WormFood: it just boggles my mind, that I can't submit an anonymous bug report....I've even made code contributions to other projects anonymously....it is like they want to make it hard on us to submit a bugreport.
09:35  squeeze: I get much smaller characters since KMS
09:35  squeeze: at least I think it has to do with kms
09:35  Iridos: squeeze, I have 80x25 on this machine which is a squeeze install and I never did anything to change it...
09:35  squeeze: oh, you´re lucky!
09:36  delby: i am running squeeze with gnome. should i use vim-gnome or vim-gtk?
09:36  Iridos: hm, you're using framebuffer, then?
09:36  WormFood: I just installed a fresh copy of squeeze a few weeks ago, and initially it came up in a higher than 80x25 screen, but after I updated and rebooted, it reverted to its "normal" (shit) 80x25 screen
09:36  Iridos: WormFood, I guess they want to be able to reach people to ask questions if the reports are sufficiently stupid?
09:36  squeeze: ah, yes, if I don´t install any X stuff I get thast too, but as soon as I install something graphical, it changes
09:37  squeeze: s/thast/that/
09:37  WormFood: I didn't install anything GUI related, and it still changed it for me (this is a server)
09:38  Iridos: delby, run what you like?
09:38  delby: dont understand the difference
09:38  WormFood: I was rather unhappy about that, because I want the highest text "resolution" I can tolerate....20 years ago, I used to run 100x40 text screen...it was nice (back when everyone else was running 80x24/25 and 80x50
09:38  Iridos: well, I have "X stuff", but not framebuffer
09:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 873]
09:39  WormFood: delby, you probably want vim-gnome
09:39  squeeze: I do not know if something switched to fb, I didn´t. How to test?
09:39  delby: thanks.
09:39  squeeze: Is that depending on graphic chip?
09:39  Iridos: !tell squeeze about fbcon resolution
09:41  Iridos: squeeze, look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log ... or... I guess lsmod |grep fb should show something (but I don't use framebuffer, so I don't know what modules are loaded)
09:41  Iridos: dmesg should also show some lines with "framebuffer" in it if the boot isn't too long ago
09:42  squeeze: I think dpkg (the bot) gives me outdated advice (Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst). Should be updated.
09:42  squeeze: Iridos: thanks
09:43  ethanol: good mornin' ircers
09:43  Iridos: squeeze, well, you can update it... grub2 worked out-of-the-box for me, so I never had to find out how it works yet...
09:44  Iridos: except for some fuzzy "puts stuff in /etc(?) somewhere"
09:44  Sort_-R: What are the _* functions listed in set for (ie _apt_get)?
09:44  Iridos: mind that the advice is still right for lenny...
09:46  squeeze: Iridos: ah yes, forgot that.
09:47  Iridos: still 1600 release critical bugs... so still lots of time
09:48  Iridos: oh, tell a lie, only 916
09:49  Trewas: Iridos: 266 says http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/, and it will be eventyally with RC bugs anyway
09:49  Trewas: +released
09:49  Iridos: oh... I misread that... you're right
09:49  Iridos: how can the current stable release have 916
09:50  Trewas: because bugs other than security bugs are not (usually) fixed in stable
09:50  Iridos: well, seems they were all found after the release
09:51  Iridos: funny thing is, there's more now than when it was testing
09:51  squeeze: Iridos:  /var/log/Xorg.0.log has (==) intel(0): Depth 24, (--) framebuffer bpp 32  and  (II) intel(0): Allocated new frame buffer 1024x600 stride 4096, tiled  How does that influence my way oof getting 80x25 text mode back?
09:53  Iridos: look at the factoid dpkg told you about... as I said, I never used framebuffer
09:54  Iridos: or did I ...
09:54  squeeze: hwinfo --framebuffer  does not list modes for 1024x600 (which is what I think I have)
09:55  squeeze: Iridos: no.
09:55  Iridos: ... send it to the wrong person... no, I didnt :)
09:55  squeeze: I don´t know if I do need framebuffer either, but my installation just arranged it like that ;)
09:56  Iridos: I don't think you have the "correct" resolution on the default text console either
09:57  squeeze: so what to do next?
09:57  Sort_-R: set | grep "^_"  | grep "()" => What are these bash functions supposed to do ?
09:57  Iridos: probably more like 800x600
09:57  Iridos: dunno... fool around with stuff?
09:58  Iridos: there's also programs like SVGATextmode, but again I have no idea if they play nicely with framebuffer or if it makes any difference
09:59  squeeze: Iridos: but anyway, many thanks for your help. Much appreciated :)
10:01  Iridos: guess running SVGATextmode 80x25 can't hurt... well, can't hurt more than crashing the machine, that is :-P
10:01  sweetpi: squeeze: try "video=vesa vga=normal", it should give you your normal console back
10:02  gan: how to know the debian os is supporting sata hard disk .. please lets know the answer urgently
10:02  squeeze: will try both...
10:04  Iridos: gan, you try to run it, it runs, so it must have worked?
10:04  Sort_-R: tab completion was answered on oftc for _* functions...
10:04  delby: where does iceweasel save startup configuration? home page for example? i know how to set it in preferences, i want to know where is it saved.
10:05  Iridos: everything is in .mozilla/firefox/....
10:05  gan: Iridos, it is  running .. i want to know which driver is exactly responsible for that
10:06  gan: Iridos, i checked the conf of kernel , so many parameters are enabled i want to which is exactly responsible for that
10:07  Iridos: gan, look in dmesg for the lines when the harddisk was detected... it might say
10:07  Iridos: but it might not even be a kernel module, but something that is just compiled into the kernel
10:08  Iridos: gan, how about libata...
10:08  delby: Iridos: found it. thanks
10:09  gan: Iridos, it means
10:09  gan: Iridos, libata means
10:11  Iridos: !libata
10:11  dpkg: libata is a Linux library supporting ATA controllers and devices.  Devices handled by libata appear as SCSI devices with associated device names: 'sd' (hard drive, instead of 'hd'), 'sr' (optical), 'st' (tape).  The old IDE (PATA) drivers are replaced with libata in Debian kernel images as of linux-2.6 2.6.32-10.  http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Libata_FAQ .  See also <uuid>.
10:12  Chosi: is there a way to limit max instances of a service with the standard inetd?
10:13  squeeze: Iridos: can´t find SVGATextmode in squeeze.
10:14  Iridos: Chosi,  you can limit the total amount of processes in /etc/security/limits.conf if the service doesn't run as root, I guess
10:14  Chosi: ah okay thanks
10:15  Iridos: !why is svgatextmode not in testing
10:15  dpkg: svgatextmode is not in testing for the reasons listed in http://release.debian.org/migration/testing.pl?package=svgatextmode
10:15  Chosi: i just need to limit the max proftpd instances
10:15  Chosi: cause i had a - somewhat - dos this morning with too many child processes
10:15  Iridos: that needs to run as root, though if it's on port 22
10:15  Iridos: don't run it via inittab and you can probably configure it...
10:16  Chosi: me?
10:16  Iridos: yes
10:16  Chosi: so i better run it standalone?
10:16  Chosi: alright
10:16  Iridos: well, look for some option in proftpd to limit connections...
10:16  Chosi: yeah i already found it but it's only working in standalone mode
10:16 --- blazie0 is now known as blaize
10:16  Chosi: that's why i was asking for the inetd limiting
10:16  Iridos: or you could install something like fail2ban if the DOS had a lot of failed logins...
10:17  Chosi: well that's the problem
10:17 --- smiler_ is now known as smiler
10:17  Chosi: 10:13 Chosi  hey there i'm having some trouble with attacks that just let logins timeout
10:17  Chosi: 10:13 Chosi  i don't think fail2ban will do anything in this case, right?
10:17  Iridos: inetd has no way of knowing how many instances run, so I don't think you can limit from inetd
10:18  Chosi: http://i.imgur.com/5RpMO.png
10:18  Chosi: looking like this
10:18  Iridos: Chosi, fail2ban will block the IP after 3 (or any number) of unsuccessful login attempts...
10:18  Chosi: will this count as unsuccessful?
10:18  Chosi: :)
10:18  Iridos: !wdytias
10:18  Iridos: dammit
10:18  Iridos: !wdyti
10:18  dpkg: Why don't you try it?

10:20  Iridos: squeeze, tsk, I still have the lenny version installed - I actually did a fresh install after using the same system since potato on several computers in sequence... but I did install lenny and then went to squeeze
10:21  squeeze: (to get 80x25 text mode back) maybe I could try a bigger console font? don´t know which one and how.
10:21  Iridos: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=548862 is why it's gone
10:21  Iridos: sheesh, bit harsh, not _everyone_ uses nvidia!
10:22  squeeze: Iridos: you where faster then me, but just arrived at 548862 fgrom the link you gave earlyer...
10:26  Iridos: but I guess the argument that it shouldn't mess in hardware the kernel controls has some weight

11:59  cusco: :| dunno
11:59  cusco: reload the module?
12:01  Moskito: petemc, because the setup is: client --> patchcable --> house installation cable --> patchcable --> gigabit switch, the patchcables are ok for sure, the house installation cable is a bit older, but should be still ok for gigabit connections (no problems with any other computer...)
12:02  sedulous: what do you use to start and monitor multiple processes, like several openvpn or apache instances? there has to be something better than the standard sysvinit

12:08  p0g0__: Moskito: fwiw, I had a client with a mouse chewed but not severed cat5 cable- it would ping, but lost so many packets that the IF would go down and up, and depending on what OS/tool I used it was reported as perfect or OK, but never dead...all the multimeter tests and such passed fine too. I had to shorten the cable, then all was good.
12:10  SWFu: Must be something to do with unetbootin?

12:30  Boohemian: what is the difference between chown and chgrp? i want to make www-data the owner of a folder and all its contents... i can't tell whether to use chown or chgrp
12:31  dreamer: chown -> change owner, chgrp -> change group
12:31  Digdilem: you'd use chown for that as you're changing owner
12:31  lenswipe: geekosopher, didnt do anything
12:31  geekosopher: lenswipe: in the run command dialogue (Alt+F2) first do 'metacity --replace'... that should start metacity then 'compiz' again
12:31  Digdilem: Boohemian, you can do both by seperating with :
12:31  lenswipe: yep
12:31  lenswipe: nothing
12:32  Digdilem: eh; chown www-data:www-data filename
12:32  lenswipe: fucking updates
12:32  Boohemian: oh, duh! i've been up too long :)
12:32  Boohemian: thanks!

13:04  ChrisBuchholz: Hi guys. I wonder, if it is possible, to use ubuntu ppa's in debian? Like, ppa's from launchpad and so?
13:05  abrotman: it would be a pretty bad idea
13:05  ChrisBuchholz: abrotman: i see. How come?
13:05  abrotman: a) Debian is not Ubuntu b) They're built for Ubuntu c) They're built by non-DDs
13:05  abrotman: just to name a few
13:06  abrotman: !why not use a ppa
13:06  dpkg: PPAs (Ubuntu's Personal Package Archives, see <PPA>) are not built against Debian releases, they are built against Ubuntu releases.  This makes using packages from them on a Debian box highly unlikely to work out well.  Ask me about <ssb> <package recompile> <bobbitt>.
13:06  abrotman: Also, I'm not sure package correctness is verified by anyone with a clue
13:07  ChrisBuchholz: abrotman: oh okay. I understand. Would be pretty neat to be able to use the mactel for ubuntu on a proper distribution, though :)
13:07  ChrisBuchholz: abrotman: the mactel packages*
13:08  abrotman: you can do whatever you want .. i'm telling you it's a bad idea
13:08  ChrisBuchholz: abrotman: yeah, i understand. And i am not gonna do. Was just curious is it was possible without getting in to trouble
13:08  ChrisBuchholz: and compromising your system
13:10  abrotman: I'm telling you that it's not recommended .. Do whatever you want, it's your machine .. don't blame Debian if it breaks
13:10  abrotman: s/if/when/
13:10  ChrisBuchholz: abrotman: i fully understand
13:12  sedulous: ChrisBuchholz: some PPAs are fine. I'm using the wine-ubuntu PPA on 3 debian systems and don't have a single problem with it.
13:13  sedulous: it's not recommended but can be okay.
13:13  ChrisBuchholz: sedulous: yeah okay. You might try it to know it
13:13  abrotman: or it could completely hose your system
13:14  ChrisBuchholz: debian wiki actually suggest using some ubuntu packages. Hmm...
13:24  jelly: sedulous: in addition, the lack of QA and central security on PPA repositories make it a possible venue for malware
13:25  sedulous: jelly: yeah that's true. i guess i should maintain my own wine package
13:26  sedulous: i don't know why debian doesn't have wine-1.3.x, not even in experimental
13:26  sedulous: i usually don't care alot about the latest versions but wine is different
13:26  jelly: ask the maintainer, he seems to be somewhat missing in action
13:27  jelly: there's a months old patchset/build tree for wine 1.2 and other necessary build bits in BTS that he didn't act upon
13:28  jelly: it's going to be a bit sad if squeeze release is done with wine 1.0 still in it, but hey
13:29  jelly: it's not like release mgr would allow the required intrusive changes to that package at this point anyway
13:31  jelly: sedulous: I'm starting to view Debian as a nice starting point to base a usable system upon; it has some but not all the software I need, and lots of it is missing for silly, non-technical reasons.  Wine is one example; djbdns another.  I'm sure I could find more.
13:32  rioch: During installation I'm told rtl8168d-1.fw is missing. What should I do? It says I can load it from removable media, but do I need to?
13:32  jelly: so yeah, use your PPA if it works for you. ;-)

13:32  rioch: jelly, it fails to get a network address via DHCP
13:33  rioch: so I'm guessing it doesn't work.
13:33  sedulous: jelly: why isn't djbdns in debian? license issues? isn't it public domain?
13:34  jelly: sedulous: it's in debian, just not in testing.

13:46  jelly: ravenzz: it hosts both.  A Debian stable release does not update upstream versions during its lifetime, thus keeping the featureset, ABI and bugsets known.

14:08  D4rKr0W: Marvilleke: have you considered using a software to manage the different vhosts?

14:34  noo: hello I got a usb planctronics headset and I can't get it working. If I plug it in, then I can see it when typing lsusb, but I can't hear any sound. Can somebody help me sorting out this problem?
14:34  deoxxa: libnoise is installed at /usr/include/libnoise on lenny, whereas it should be at /usr/include/noise. why is this so?
14:35  k-man: setserial is broken
14:35  k-man: it refuses to save and reload the state of my serial ports correctly
14:35  noo: ok so If I choose usb audio under the sound preferences dialog, then I can hear this really very loud beep, but I can't control the volume :(
14:36  micols: alsamixer -c1 often
14:36  micols: or -c2
14:37  micols: not sure if it helps, sometimes you cannot control usb volume in alsa, alsa is buggy sometimes I think , try installing alsamixer
14:38  micols: I use alsamixer -c0 (sblive), -c1 (usb webcam) , -c2 (usb condenser mic)
14:38  submundo: a3a4
14:38  micols: but recently I cannot control volume of the webcam, it is locked
14:38  stew: deoxxa: have you checked the changelog?
14:38  deoxxa: stew: i have not, i'll do so
14:38  noo: ok so alsamixer -c1 helped me a little, because now I can at least see the alsamixer for the headset soundcard, but still I can't hear anything if I start a youtube video. Is there a command to change the soundcard that is used ?

14:40  micols: 81.161.188.225/asoundrc noo , that might help you
14:40  micols: save as .asoundrc in ~
14:40  micols: you might have to edit the first lines
14:40  micols: to i.e. card 1 instead of 0
14:41  deoxxa: stew, unfortunately it looks like that's just The Debian Way (TM) of installing headers after reading the bug list. makes it a bit of a pain to write makefiles for though :(
14:41  micols: (could be card 0,1,2 in your case, try them all)
14:41  noo: micols: thank you I'll try that! :)
14:43  micols: if you use mplayer-plugin , you might have to change to ao=alsa in .mplayer/config (might help, not sure)
14:43  stew: deoxxa: hmm.  I don't know why that would be the debian way
14:43  micols: (you could try that after asoundrc)
14:43  stew: deoxxa: i'd consider following up to 400410 suggesting they just use the default install dirs

16:03  ToMoO_0: have a nice day, bye
16:03  shane4ubuntu: to the root of my current ubuntu install, not to the new installation.  I mounted the partition as /mnt/debinst  and created the work directory in there and that is where I did ar -x deboot......deb
16:04  stew: shane4ubuntu: yes, it will unzip to the root of your installation, the data.tar.gz will have files like usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/lenny.  you can check before unzipping with "tar tvf /full-path-to-work/work/data.tar.gz"
16:04  shane4ubuntu: stew: it seems like that should be in the /mnt/debinst    and not in my current installation though.
16:04  stew: shane4ubuntu: however, if you are running a recent ubuntu, and are installing lenny, you could probably just run "apt-get install debootstrap" to get your current ubuntu version and skip to D.3.3
16:05  shane4ubuntu: yes, I would feel better about doing it that way.
16:05  stew: shane4ubuntu: no, you are going to run this software in ubuntu, not in debian
16:05  stew: shane4ubuntu: note that installing it from ubuntu will do this step you are worried about for you, but its going to do the exact same thing

16:25  lenswipe: jelly, no, i didnt have to do it
16:25  lenswipe: jelly, but i get plagued by notifications if i dont
16:26  lenswipe: i love how something comes from the official debian repos and messes my machine up and the good people on IRC still manage to claim its my fault
16:26  jelly: lenswipe: you can remove the software
16:26  Iridos: are you saying it's _my_ fault?
16:26  Iridos: jelly, I think he wants a fight!
16:26  lenswipe: jelly, not to be rude, but if you worked in a shop and someone brought back say a pair of jeans that fell apart would you tell them that its their fault for purchasing them?
16:27  lenswipe: its the same principle
16:27  lenswipe: either way
16:27  lenswipe: how do i undo this?
16:27  Iridos: well, in this case, I'll give you a full refund and you can hand debian back...
16:27  stew: lenswipe: if they were given the jeans under the understand that "we are just testing these and expect they might fall apart..."
16:27  jelly: lenswipe: you bought it from Ye Olde Funky Random Pants Shoppe... there's no warranty, expected or implied
16:27  Iridos: nono, I feel fine with giving him $0 back... no problem
16:28  lenswipe: stew, i wasnt given the xorg update on that understanding though, i was given them from the official debian lenny stable updates
16:28  jelly: lenswipe: testing or unstable might contain completely broken software.
16:28  shane4ubuntu: Iridos: yes, but it is a great learning experience, and I can do my work on primary install.
16:28  lenswipe: stew, i didnt see anything about "we are just testing this and dont know if it will cause problems or not" if i had done i wouldnt have install it.
16:28  stew: lenswipe: what upgrade caused this?
16:28  lenswipe: jelly, i was given them from the official debian lenny stableupdates
16:28  jelly: lenswipe: the whole testing release is about that.
16:28  stew: lenswipe: from what version to what version?
16:28  lenswipe: steffen-, some xorg update
16:28  lenswipe: stew, not sure, it came out yesterday so someone else might know
16:29  stew: lenswipe: /var/log/dpkg.log would know
16:29  lenswipe: jelly, im not using the testing release
16:29  lenswipe: jelly, im using lenny
16:29  lenswipe: stew, ill take a look
16:29  jelly: lenswipe: lenny?  Update Manager?  pastebin your /var/log/dpkg.log and /var/log/aptitude, please
16:29  lenswipe: surely
16:29  lenswipe: gimme a minuyte
16:29  lenswipe: minute*
16:29  jelly: I've only seen that PoS in testing and unstable
16:30  Iridos: I also assumed squeeze... that's what you expect from it...
16:30  lenswipe: here is /var/log/dpkg.log: http://pastebin.com/PTx8DQ1U
16:30  Iridos: I'm still willing to refund $0.00
16:30  stew: the last update of the xorg package in lenny was 1.5 years ago
16:30  eshat: Is it possible to tell "git-buildpackage --git-pbuilder" which basepath to use ?
16:30  lenswipe: stew, well someone else got one earlier today
16:31  lenswipe: jelly, /var/log/aptitude is empty
16:31  Iridos: shane4ubuntu, well, sure, but that's "playing around" mostly...
16:31  stew: ahh, that one was from 2 months ago
16:32  lenswipe: stew, 2 months ago?
16:32  lenswipe: why did i only just get it?
16:32  shane4ubuntu: Iridos: I guess, but I can continue to do what needs to be done, as opposed to waiting for all those downloads, updates etc, I can let that work while I work.
16:32  stew: lenswipe: yes, 2 months ago: http://packages.qa.debian.org/x/xorg-server/news/20100925T135952Z.html
16:33  shane4ubuntu: Iridos: and there is nothing like being familiar with your system, yes, it isn't probably the fastest way, but this is a side project.
16:33  jelly: stew: was it sitting in proposed-updates?
16:33  yonkeltron: if i need to roll my own package in a hurry, is checkinstall still the preferred way?

16:33  lenswipe: stew, why did it only just come through?
16:34  lenswipe: and how do i get compiz working again?
16:34  jelly: (I knew that would happen!)
16:34 * lenswipe likes compiz :(
16:34  stew: ahh, perhaps since it was not security related it was just part of the point release
16:34  lenswipe: yeah could be
16:34  bejelith: Hi all
16:34  babilen: yonkeltron: dh_make is also a good start. But what are you trying to achieve?
16:34  lenswipe: stew, anyway, how do i go about fixing this snafu?
16:34  stew: lenswipe: checked the bts?
16:34  lenswipe: the what?
16:34  stew: the bug tracking system?
16:35  jelly: lenswipe: you can try downgrading to the previous version from snapshot.debian.org, and report bugs if it's a regresion.
16:35  markit: hi, hd led is blinking, iotop shows nothing doing i/o, iostat shows io on sda, but how can I find what process is doing I/O?
16:35  stew: lenswipe: make sure compiz is up to date
16:35  lenswipe: stew, no i havent
16:35  lenswipe: stew, okay
16:35  bejelith: i cant find any help on google to compile a debian source package for ia64 arch on a amd64 CPU, can someone give my some info?
16:35  yonkeltron: babilen: a package in squeeze was mis-built, i filed a bug but i need the correct build of it fromthe original source. don't want to resort to a make install or just aliasing the command if i can avoid it
16:35  stew: lenswipe: see http://bugs.debian.org/packagename for compiz and any x related package that just got updated
16:35  lenswipe: jelly, so i would download the previous version of xorg and install that?
16:35  lenswipe: stew, okay
16:35  babilen: !tell yonkeltron about package recompile
16:36  yonkeltron: yes, i know. the deb sources seem to have been patched improperly so a rebuild prob won't fix it
16:36  babilen: yonkeltron: You don't have to start from scratch, because you can use the original Debian package and adapt debian/rules to your liking
16:36  jelly: lenswipe: you would download the previous version of the affected package and install that.  it's not called "xorg" but a bit different, it's in your dpkg.log
16:37  lenswipe: jelly, xserver-xorg-core
16:37  lenswipe: that the one?
16:37  babilen: yonkeltron: You can also use something like stow to install to /usr/local/stow/your_package from the upstream tarball. But if you only need to adjust some compile flags you should follow the steps dpkg told you about.
16:38  yonkeltron: ok
16:38  yonkeltron: i'll consider that
16:38  yonkeltron: thanks
16:39  Iridos: yonkeltron, it's not very difficult to remove single patches that break something when you recompile either, though
16:40  eshat: Can anybody recommend linux kernel 2.6.36 from experimental on a sid system ?
16:40  babilen: eshat: Tried it on Squeeze and had problems with suspend/hibernation. Apart from that it worked great.
16:40  yonkeltron: Iridos: fair enough. i'll look at these things.
16:41 * eshat is installing 2.6.36
16:49  yonkeltron: Iridos, babilen: this won't work, i need to start from scratch because the wrong version of the problematic library is in squeeze (way lower version). basically, this package is supposed to provide an executable which has a certain version of a library compiled in. this is provided in the upstream source. the debian package doesn't use that one but uses the system version which is very wrong.
16:50  babilen: yonkeltron: And the version you want is not packaged in Debian?
16:50  yonkeltron: no. but that shouldn't matter because everything needed to build this package is included in the upstream source. it depends on a specific version which is why it's meant to be built as a self-contained executable
16:51  stew: yonkeltron: is there a bug filed about this in the debian bts?
16:51  yonkeltron: yes
16:51  silidan: is it possible to resize the root partition in running linux?
16:51  yonkeltron: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=605447
16:51  stew: silidan: its possible to make it bigger, depending on the filesystem type
16:51  yonkeltron: i filed it only yesterday evening
16:51  silidan: stew: good is it also possible to shring the /home partition in a running system?
16:52  stew: silidan: yes, but it would have to be unmounted
16:54  silidan: stew: some tut anywere?
16:54  stew: silidan: what filesystem?
16:54  babilen: yonkeltron: I recommend one of the following: i) use stow for the local install ii) use checkinstall (i prefer stow) and iii) upgrade the library package to the version you want and modify the programs packaging to (build-)depend on that version.
16:54  silidan: stew: ext3
16:54  stew: silidan: then "man resize2fs"
16:54  yonkeltron: babilen: stow won't shit all over my system? i'd only used checkinstall before. i also don't know how to make those changes, i'm not a dpm or debian developer
16:54  stew: silidan: for growing, you have to first resize the containing block device (partition?), for shrinking, you'd do that after
16:54  shane4ubuntu: ok, my sources.list is a little on the lean side, I basically have security main contrib non-free is there a good standard sources.list I can see that is not dangerous. :)
16:54  babilen: yonkeltron: stow just makes local installations to /usr/local easier. You install the software to /usr/local/stow/whatever and stow will handle symlinks
16:54  stew: shane4ubuntu: /msg dpkg lenny sources.list
16:54  babilen: !tell yonkeltron about stow
16:54  yonkeltron: babilen: thanks. i'll do that, then
16:54  babilen: !tell yonkeltron about stow usage
16:54  babilen: !tell yonkeltron about stow usage
16:54  shane4ubuntu: stew thanks again!
16:55  babilen: yonkeltron: It is probably the easiest and fastest way.
16:55  yonkeltron: gotcha
16:55  shane4ubuntu: stew seems that is the same as /msg dpkg sources.list  :)
16:55  stew: shane4ubuntu: it is
16:56  silidan: stew: no easy way with simply using gparted or so?
16:57  stew: silidan: probably, I dont' know,  i've never used it
16:57  shane4ubuntu: hmm, is there a virtual package to get the gnome-desktop?  I found this: http://packages.debian.org/stable/gnome/gnome-desktop-environment  but seems I don't have the right sources.list to get that.
16:58  abrotman: !install gnome
16:58  dpkg: To install GNOME: install the 'gnome' package to install everything, the 'gnome-desktop-environment' package for slightly less stuff, or the 'gnome-core' package for even less.  You will need X installed as well, ask me about <install x>.  http://wiki.debian.org/Gnome
16:58  yonkeltron: babilen: make install didn't honor the prefix arg, i guess i'll use checkinstall.
16:58  babilen: yonkeltron: You configured with "./configure --prefix=/usr/local/stow/program-version" ?
16:59  shane4ubuntu: how legit is this:  http://debgen.simplylinux.ch/
17:00  babilen: shane4ubuntu: http://www.debian.org/mirror/list ← legit if it is on this list
17:01  babilen: yonkeltron: I see that the stow usage factoid uses the "prefix=/..." in the "make install" command. I'll typically configure with it. Never used the latter. Let me know if that works and I'll change the factoid.
17:02  yonkeltron: babilen: yeah, the factoid should be modified.
17:02  yonkeltron: babilen: thanks for the guidance
17:03  babilen: yonkeltron: I'll do that and you are welcome.
17:04  DotHack: hi!
17:05  binarym: hi
17:05  DotHack: i'm trying to install squeeze as VM in Citrix XenServer but it hang when choosing "Expert Intall" in the installer after displayig the line Grant table initialized..
17:05  DotHack: anyone ideas how to fix this? Bootloader option maybe?
17:06  leafwiz: Hi, i'm trying to compile some software.  But the autogen.sh cant find all the libs, but I have them on the system in /usr/local/lib. I have tried setting the  paths to :export CPPFLAGS=/usr/local/include/:/usr/include/; export LIBS=/usr/local/lib/:/lib/:/usr/lib/;
17:06  binarym: i have "200% 1000 200% linux-swap method{ swap } format{ } ." on the partman section of a preseed file, when i run my installer on a server with 8Gb of RAM, i get a 96Gb partition for swap ... any idea ? :(
17:07  babilen: shane4ubuntu: Ah, should have looked at the link first. This will generate a (not very well documented) sources.list and also gives you the opportunity to select a number of third-party repositories of unkown quality that are not supported by Debian. It is also out-of-date (backports is official now)
17:07  leafwiz: Do I need to define a bin path as well?
17:07  binarym: leafwiz: you musn't use autogen.sh when you compile software
17:07  binarym: you must use ./configure --include-dir=/usr/local && make all install
17:08  shane4ubuntu: babilen: no prob, I didn't select any 3rd party stuff except multimedia, and can worry about backports later, just want the primary sources.list for now, thanks
17:08  binarym: correct me if i'm wrong but autogen is for generating autotool's stuff like configure, etc...
17:09  leafwiz: binarym, oh.. okay. I'll try that. I'm just repeating what I have seen in some guides.
17:09  binarym: leafwiz: however, you can try to export INCLUDEDIR
17:09  binarym: and LIBDIR too :)
17:09  cybor0: hello some help courier imap : ../bash/make_cmd.c:99: cannot allocate 555 bytes
17:10  binarym: cybor0: can you please aks a real question ? I can't understand your problem ...
17:11  leafwiz: binarym, mmf... ./configure gives me error. I probably messed up the paths : this is what they are now.  CPPFLAGS=/usr/local/include/:/usr/include/; export LIBS=/usr/local/lib/:/lib/:/usr/lib/;.
17:11  binarym: leafwiz: you must unset CPPFLAGS
17:11  binarym: CPPFLAGS is for flags passed to the preprocessor, not path
17:12  cybor0: when starting coureir imap i have this error: Starting Courier IMAP-SSL server: imapd-ssl/etc/init.d/courier-imap-ssl: xmalloc: ../bash/make_cmd.c:99: cannot allocate 555 bytes (0 bytes allocated)
17:12  leafwiz: binarym, okay.
17:13  binarym: cybor0: is your system up-to-date ?
17:13  shane4ubuntu: ok, something is missing, I run: tasksel --task-packages -t install gnome-desktop --new-install and it returns nothing?  must be I'm missing something in my sources.list?
17:14  binarym: cybor0: asking google, i got that: http://www.dotmana.com/?p=492
17:14  binarym: did you tried it ?
17:14  babilen: shane4ubuntu: Try "aptitude install gnome-desktop-environment" (or "gnome" or "gnome-core" for more/less packages)
17:15  cybor0: binarym i readed this and didn;t help
17:15  shane4ubuntu: babilen: that is what I'm saying too, when I run apt-cache search gnome-desktop-environment it doesn't show anything, and for the record I did apt-get update. :)
17:15  shane4ubuntu: also, gnome-core shows nothing
17:15  leafwiz: binarym, can you think of anything else? Still gives me error and exit 77 -  http://pastebin.com/0YCzPPMN
17:17  babilen: shane4ubuntu: Paste output of "apt-cache policy", "apt-cache policy gnome-core" and your sources.list to http://paste.debian.net
17:18  shane4ubuntu: babilen: http://paste.debian.net/101144/
17:19  shane4ubuntu: babilen: for the second command:  W: Unable to locate package gnome-core

17:19  binarym: then tried again

17:21  binarym: leafwiz: moreover, you can make your system aware of /usr/local libs using ldconfig. Just read the manpage ldconfig(8)
17:21  DotHack: no one?
17:21  babilen: himuraken: You most likely don't want a MTU of 9000
17:21  binarym: himuraken: man interfaces .... then search for mty
17:21  binarym: mtu
17:22  shane4ubuntu: babilen: for the sources.list, I'm removing lenny-proposed-updates that doesn't look right.
17:22  babilen: himuraken: And yes, it is "mtu 1500" (or something like that)
17:22  himuraken: babilen, I will be setting to 9000 for jumbo frames etc. Thanks.
17:23  babilen: himuraken: OK :)
17:23  cybor0: binarym up to date help
17:24  binarym: cybor0: no more idea, sorry :(

18:10  stew: but wait, debian  doesn'tt use alternatives for sendmail
18:11  stew: cybor0: what does "apt-cache policy postfix" say for "Installed: "?
18:11  cybor0: stew update-alternatives: error: sometkinh like no alternatives
18:12  stew: cybor0: yeah, that's right, sendmail isn't normally managed by alternatives
18:12  cybor0: stew: apt-cache http://pastebin.com/ua2y3Su7
18:13  stew: cybor0: so this is something your administrator must have done?
18:14  stew: i'm running the same version of postfix, it doesn't use the altneratives system for /usr/sbin/sendmail
18:14  cybor0: the postfix is broken and he is away for one week
18:15  cybor0: show stew
18:15  cybor0: so stew what should i do
18:15  hektik: i have a question. im using proftpd. and i want to add users to my box, but i want them all to have access to the safe folder when using ftp
18:15  stew: cybor0: ask him why he replaced postfix's /usr/sbin/sendmail with a broken symlink
18:16  cybor0: oki wehen he be back i will
18:16  cybor0: but what could i do righ now
18:16  stew: cybor0: you could "aptitude reinstall postfix" perhaps, but it makes me wonder what he was doing and why
18:16  Usuario190: hello how can i packup one folder from my home.tar ?
18:17  cybor0: maybe i disable spamassain
18:17  cybor0: ??
18:17  stew: cybor0: you could also skip spamassassin perhaps
18:17  cybor0: stew: oki soem comment pipe
18:17  stew: cybor0: and actually, now that I think of it, sendmail would have to be some alternative, since otherwise, sendmail is just going to be postfix again, creating a loop
18:18  stew: cybor0: what do you mean by "oki soem comment pipe" ?
18:18  hektik: i have a question. im using proftpd. and i want to add users to my box, but i want them all to have access to the safe folder when using ftp
18:18  cybor0: stew: i comnet line in master.cf with spamassasin to disable this
18:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 922]
18:19  dkr: hektik: read the proftpd docs.
18:20  stew: cybor0: no, leave that alone.  you need to tell postfix to use a different service for delivery.  if you just comment it out, then you'll get errors trying to delier using a non-existant service
18:20  cybor0: stew: so how to do that
18:21  stew: cybor0: what is the output of "postconf -n"?
18:21  stew: cybor0: btw, what happened to break all of this?
18:21  stew: cybor0: and why are you running a mail server on testing instsead of stable?
18:21  hektik: thx dkr, thats a great idea. why didnt i think of that?
18:22  dkr: hektik: you were too busy repeating your question here? ;)
18:22  hektik: yea, thats it isnt it
18:22  dkr: but seriously, that is a very common thing and I don't know the details since i don't use it, but it has to be covered by the docs/faq about setting up groups
18:23  stew: what is the safe folder?
18:23  nick_h: given an entry from sources.list , how can one determine the url to the apt repo?
18:23  nick_h: eg: deb http://www.serverdensity.com/downloads/linux/debian lenny main
18:23  cybor0: stew: i don't know
18:24  stew: cybor0: to which question? there were three
18:24  cybor0: stew: when i comment i get  (mail transport unavailable)
18:24  stew: cybor0: yeah, that's what I meant by "no, leave that alone.  you need to tell postfix to use a different service for delivery.  if you just comment it out, then you'll get errors trying to delier using a non-existant service"
18:25  cybor0: stew: so how to tell to use diffrent service
18:25  stew: cybor0: how did you tell it to use the spamassassin transport?
18:26  stew: (I'd be able to tell you, but both of my requests for your postfix main configuration have gone unanswered)
18:26  blink: I am wondering how I can bring up additional IPs on a given interface if the initial configuration is done in initrd
18:27  cybor0: stew: this is in master.cf
18:27  blink: normally I approach this by doing 'post-up ip' commands
18:27  cybor0: stew: so i have to write another service there
18:27  stew: cybor0: no, its in main.cf and would be output by the "postconf -n" i've asked for
18:27  stew: cybor0: no
18:28  dkr: stew: I assumed "safe folder" was a typo for "same dir" :)
18:30  stew: cybor0: what does "ls -l /etc/alternatives/sendmail" return?
18:30  cybor0: stew: postconf -n
18:30  cybor0: alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
18:30  cybor0: alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
18:30  cybor0: append_dot_mydomain = no
18:30  cybor0: biff = no
18:30  cybor0: broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes
18:30 <-- debhelper has kicked cybor0 from #debian (use http://paste.debian.net or /msg dpkg paste)
18:32  cybor0: stew: http://pastebin.com/XhJ6wyiS
18:33  stew: cybor0: so you'd have to be making changes to the database table referenced in :/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual_transports.cf
18:33  stew: cybor0: but i really think you should be figuring out what /usr/sbin/sendmail si supposed to be doing
18:35  cybor0: stew: how from where
18:35  stew: cybor0: how what?
18:36  blink: I am wondering how I can bring up additional IPs on a given interface if the initial configuration is done in initrd; the interface is live before the networking script is run.
18:36  stew: blink: how is the interface defined in /etc/network/interfaces?
18:36  cybor0: what do you mean
18:36  stew: cybor0: i mean what do you mean by "how from where"  I don't understand your question
18:36  blink: it's not. it's just up when I boot. ovh colocated server with iscsi storage for root
18:37  googlah: stew: tried to use google? :-)
18:37  blink: since the iscsi for / depends on ip, the initrd takes care of that much before the system can load.
18:38  stew: blink: do you need the additional IP address to be added before other services start?
18:38  stew: googlah: why do you ask?
18:38  markuman: can i use more than one mailaddress in cron-apt?
18:38  blink: stew: it would be helpful, as long as it starts before openvpn (as the IP I wish to add is the egress point for clients using SNAT)
18:39 --- D4rKr0W is now known as D4rKr0W`afk
18:40  cybor0: stew: table is empty
18:40  stew: blink: I'm not sure I understand the semantics, but I'd guess you can configure the interface using the manual method, and still use the up or pre-up directives
18:40  googlah: stew: sorry. i didn't see you were talking to 'blink'.
18:41  stew: cybor0: i don't believe that.  and again, i really think you should be figuring out where the missing /usr/sbin/sendmail went
18:41  stew: 12:30 < stew> cybor0: what does "ls -l /etc/alternatives/sendmail" return?
18:41  blink: hmm. I guess I'll experiement and see what happens
18:41  blink: thanks
18:42  stew: blink: the other options might be to write your own init script, and to edit the networing init script.  neither of which is as clean as using manual method if that would work
18:43  blink: is rc.local parsed after all the rest of the scripts for a given runlevel?
18:43  cybor0: stew: no file
18:44  lenswipe: hey guys
18:44  lenswipe: is there a 64 bit backported debian?
18:44  stew: lenswipe: what does that mean?
18:45  lenswipe: it means my SATA controller is too new to be recognised by debian when i installed on this machine and used the 32 bit backported installer
18:45  stew: blink: iirc it depends on the debian version.  it used to be, but then got moved earlier.  check the symlink in /etc/rc2.d to /etc/init.d/rc.local
18:45  Stylles: hi
18:45  Stylles: configure: Auth scheme modules built: ntlm basic configure: error: Basic auth helper winbind does not exist
18:45  lenswipe: i didnt know at the time my machine was a 64 bit machine
18:45  Stylles: Can someone help me with this error?
18:45  lenswipe: so i want to re-install but i still have to use the backported installer until there is support for my SATA controller
18:45  stew: lenswipe: which installer?  kmuto?
18:45  tuvwx: what other good gui's are there for kvm besides virt-manager?
18:45  lenswipe: stew, i genuinely have no idea
18:45  stew: lenswipe: i've not heard of a backported installer, kmuto is an installer with a newer kernel
18:45  lenswipe: stew, i was reffering to the kernel in the installer sorry
18:45  lenswipe: yeah
18:45  lenswipe: kmuto
18:45  stew: lenswipe: /msg dpkg kmuto
18:46  lenswipe: is there a 64 bit version tho?
18:46  stew: yes
18:46  cybor0: stew: so there is now way to disable spamassain
18:46  stew: cybor0: yes, there is.  you'd edit your transport map, but again, I'm not sure I believe this is the correct solution
18:47  stew: cybor0: the transport map is the thing that decides which transport service it uses for a given domain
18:47  stew: cybor0: right now, for this particular recipient, that is set to "spamassassin"
18:47  cybor0: stew: but what should be in that transper map this is a mysql table whit two column domain transport and tehere is now any data in this table
18:48  lenswipe: stew, the newest release of kmuto i could find had kernel Linux kernel 2.6.32
18:48  lenswipe: stew, how does that sound?
18:48 --- studyurnm3 is now known as misnix
18:49  blink: stew: cool. thanks for your help
18:49  lenswipe: stew, actually im tempted to try squeeze
18:49  lenswipe: squeeze and windows xp pro dual booted
18:49  lenswipe: :)
18:50  stew: cybor0: then I'd check the virtual_alias_maps, and virtual_mailbox_domains
18:52  stew: lenswipe: yes, 2.6.32 is the newest kernel backported for lenny, afaik, the current kernel in squeeze does not work with lenny's udev
18:52  stew: err, perhaps it does
18:52  lenswipe: stew, im concidering ditching lenny and installing squeeze to see how i get on
18:52  lenswipe: ive had serious problems with hardware support from lenny
18:52  lenswipe: like SERIOUS problems
18:53  stew: lenswipe: have you tried 2.6.32?
18:53  lenswipe: im on 2.6.32
18:53  stew: lenswipe: do you realize that installing squeeze would also have you on 2.6.32?
18:53  lenswipe: my sound goes AWOL every few days for no particular reason, sometimes Xorg wont start, now when it does start compiz wont work, lenny detects my SPDIF out as an input etc etc i could go on
18:53  stew: lenswipe: for your sound problems, i'd try /msg dpkg new alsa
18:53  lenswipe: stew, yea, but squeeze seems to have more of those things called drivers
18:54  stew: lenswipe: no it doesn't
18:54  stew: lenswipe: it has the same kernel you are running now
18:54  lenswipe: i know
18:54  lenswipe: 2.6.32-bpo.5-686
18:54  lenswipe: but im sick and tired of all the hackery im having to do get lenny to work for me
18:54  seeds: alsa dies on me everyday. i have to do alsa force-reload everytime
18:55  yagoo: i have this model name processor: AMd Athlon XP 2200+ (cat /proc/cpuinfo) .. am wondering which item i can select from make config -- not sure if its a k6 or k7 compatible processor..
18:55  lenswipe: seeds, no, my alsa seems to get occupied by process unknown and i have to reboot and do loads of other weird shit to get it to work
18:55  lenswipe: so this thing with compiz is the last straw
18:55  stew: well i'm not going to waste a lot of time trying to convince him he might be wasting a lot of time, he seems already convinced
18:56  seeds: lenswipe that is messed up
18:56  lenswipe: seeds, yes it is
18:56  lenswipe: seeds, im re-installing
18:56  stew: yagoo: it is k6 and k7 compatible, yes
18:56  googlah: yagoo: it's a k7 processor
18:56  seeds: k
18:56  lenswipe: googlah, dont u mean an i7?
18:56  lenswipe: ...k maybe not
18:56  seeds: mine starts making this hiccup sound
18:56  stew: no, he means k7
18:57  lenswipe: stew, okay
18:57  yagoo: stew, i'm guessing it's a k6.. it says cpufamily:6 ...
18:57  yagoo: ok thanks..
18:57  yagoo: :)
18:57  lenswipe: seeds, aside from that i have the following that i listed to stew .....
18:57  lenswipe: seeds, <lenswipe> my sound goes AWOL every few days for no particular reason, sometimes Xorg wont start, now when it does start compiz wont work, lenny detects my SPDIF out as an input etc etc i could go on
18:57  stew: "K7, the codename for a generation of AMD CPUs, including the Athlon, Athlon XP, Duron, and certain very early Semprons"
18:57  seeds: wow
18:57  yagoo: lenswipe, you really shouldn't be guessing here.. this is core stuff :p
18:58  lenswipe: yagoo, huh?
18:58  lenswipe: yagoo, im not guessing, im re-installing
18:58  stew: lenswipe: if you are having trouble with alsa, it makes more sense to try a new alsa version, then to reinstall just to use the same exact alsa version
18:58  seeds: i think mine gets tripped up when different sounds are playing simultaneously
18:58  solars: whats the easiest way to use a usb hsdpa modem without kde or gnome?
18:58  seeds: like web video and exaile for instance
18:58  lenswipe: stew, i want a windows xp partition anyway though
19:02  themill: dpkg: tell _2 about root
19:04  BLZbubba: if i just want to install a basic squeeze system but i don't have networking available, do I just need CD1?
19:05  seeds: can i upgrade to wheezy yet? :)
19:05  BLZbubba: it's a big gap between netinst & 52 cd's
19:06  stew: BLZbubba: yes, depending on what you expect "basic" to include

21:31  jhutchins_lt: ROKO__: You should probably look for general instructions on building software on http://wiki.debian.org
21:31  bAndie9100: what is an alternate for powersaved ? it do segfault

21:46  thewanderer1: you mean the GRUB kernel or Linux kernel?
21:46  Kasreyn: do you need NTFS kernel module for update-grub2 to work?
21:47  jelly-hme: Kasreyn: grub does its own autodetection
21:47  tbsaunde: Pyista42:  ulimit may do what you want alternatively nice, or cgroups may do something more what you like
21:47  stew: Pyista42: do you know about renice(1)?
21:47  thewanderer1: Kasreyn: it's os-prober which scans for other OS, not GRUB itself I believe
21:47  makubi: thewanderer1: well thank you very much for your help again, I appreciate your help :-)
21:48  Kasreyn: well .. when i run update-grub2 as debian stock kernel it works, when i run under my own compile it doesn't discover my windows partition
21:48  Kasreyn: so now i want to know why
21:48  thewanderer1: os-prober needs to mount NTFS to inspect the Windows version
21:48  Kasreyn: ok that probably explains it :)
21:49  Kasreyn: thanks thewanderer1
21:49 --- Channel #debian was synced in 149 seconds
21:49  Pyista42: jelly-hme: ffmpeg video transcoding
21:51  jelly-hme: Pyista42: I
21:51  jelly-hme: Pyista42: you can just renice it to +19 as see if that's good enough for you
21:51  puty: hi. any channel to html support? thanks.
21:52  Pyista42: jelly-hme: i just don't want it to use 100 percent cpu to get it done in 2 minutes while the rest of the server is at stand still.....its fine if it takes a few extra minutes....even longer then that
21:53  jelly-hme: Pyista42: well, if it's reniced it won't steal CPU time from any other processes, just idle
21:53  tbsaunde: Pyista42:  then nice is probably what you want
21:53  themill: puty: #web exists
21:54  jelly-hme: Pyista42: so again, do you care how much it takes even if CPU has _nothing else_ to do?
21:55  Pyista42: jelly-hme: it might be nice for it to take a little bit more. but it is a web server so if there is a traffic jump it would need to slown down quickly
21:56 --- ChanServ sets modes [#debian +o themill]
21:56  jelly-hme: Pyista42: the kernel will take care of that if it's niced to a low-priority value (+19 being lowest priority)

21:56 --- el_guill1rmo is now known as el_guillermo
21:56  Pyista42: + 15 is probably ok ?
21:57  jelly-hme: Pyista42: I'd put it all the way to +19 and see if that's acceptable, tune only if needed
21:58  thewanderer1: Pyista42: on a webserver, you need to set the I/O priority too
21:58  Pyista42: jelly-hme: i just want the db and web server to have full priority
21:58  thewanderer1: unless you don't give a crap about I/O and are on a 10-drive SSD storage matrix
21:58  Pyista42: this is just the ffmpeg i want to be limited .....it will be a cron
21:58  stew: what if i'm on a 9-drive SSD storage matrix?
21:59  thewanderer1: then you're not so cool :P
21:59  Pyista42: so limit io of ffmpeg and the cpu usage and the server should run flawless and be really responsive ?
21:59  thewanderer1: Pyista42: most wait is caused by I/O wait nowadays, so the proper way to run this would be `nice -- ionice -- command` of course with proper arguments
21:59  thewanderer1: yeah
22:00  Pyista42: sounds good
22:00  Pyista42: otherwise i was going to get another dedicated just for video transcoding
22:00  thewanderer1: you might also want to put some ulimit on it, like memory
22:00  Pyista42: which might have to happen eventually anyways buuut there is not many videos right now
22:00  jelly-hme: Pyista42: if that process is the only resource consumer for your bottleneck, yes
22:00  Pyista42: yes the web server will be fairly low traffic for a while
22:01  thewanderer1: if you're on a recent kernel, like 2.6.36, then putting the server in 1 cgroup and ffmpeg in another will boost responsiveness significantly
22:01  thewanderer1: does not matter on 2.6.32 and the like, though
22:02  jelly-hme: uh, cgroups exist in .32
22:02  Pyista42: i want the server to be as responsive as it possibly can
22:02  Pyista42: thewanderer1: did i mention that this is a xen vps :)
22:03  thewanderer1: jelly-hme: yes, cgroups exist in .32 but they don't offer responsiveness boost brought about by some 2.6.36 patches
22:03  jelly-hme: Pyista42: define responsive.  interactive shell usage? some specific service response time? http responses from a local web server?
22:03  Pyista42: when i run ffmpeg just straight up the apache server struggles
22:03  Pyista42: its taking up all the cpu
22:03  Pyista42: i just dont want that to happen
22:03  jelly-hme: thewanderer1: sure they do, you can still create a cgroup or three and put processes in there
22:04  thewanderer1: jelly-hme: yes, but it offers no great benefits over just nicing this ffmpeg
22:04  stew: Pyista42: and you are sure that CPU is the bottleneck instead of io?
22:04  Pyista42: i have not checked
22:04  jelly-hme: thewanderer1: duh.
22:04  thewanderer1: Pyista42: do you have only 1 CPU there? or a bunch of?
22:04  Pyista42: vps
22:04  Pyista42: :P
22:04  Pyista42: i can get a dedicated if neededc but only doing a few videos a week
22:04  thewanderer1: jelly-hme: no, really, 2.6.36 is said to do "wonders" to responsiveness under load
22:05  thewanderer1: (in cgroups)
22:05  jelly-hme: thewanderer1: I hope you're not refering to those per-tty patch silliness
22:05  thewanderer1: of course not :P
22:05  thewanderer1: Pyista42: sure, but VPS can have multiple processing nodes... only have 1?
22:05  Pyista42: yes i think so
22:05  Pyista42: i can get more as well if needed
22:05  ma-ks: !pl
22:05  dpkg: from memory, pl is polska -> #debian-pl (on irc.freenode.net).  Also, pl is a common extension for perl scripts and is sometimes used as an abbreviation for "packet loss".

22:06  thewanderer1: Pyista42: then if I were you I would use nice and ionice to run ffmpeg, and if you require more performance get some more CPU nodes
22:07  thewanderer1: running Apache under nice -5 could work, too
22:07 * chrisb wonders if extlinux will be added to the list of default bootloaders at install
22:07 * thewanderer1 thinks that the mailing list is the right place to check :P
22:07  Pyista42: will getting that newer kernel help as well thewanderer1?
22:07  LordVorp: #debian-arm is invite only... is this normal? I wanna ask about things on my Guruplug...
22:07  themill: blahdeblah: you might want to fix your client so that it doesn't flood you off the network when you first connect.
22:07  thewanderer1: Pyista42: if you're trapped inside a Xen VM, is that even possible?
22:08  Pyista42: sure
22:08  Pyista42: xen is not like openvz it does have its own kernel
22:08  Pyista42: its not userland as far as i know
22:08  thewanderer1: but it does use paravirt and requires a specially compiled kernel
22:08  stew: LordVorp: use #debian-arm on irc.debian.org instead
22:08  Pyista42: hmmm
22:08  thewanderer1: so your hosting provider, if any, might not allow you to use custom kernels I guess
22:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 934]
22:09  Pyista42: i can try
22:09  themill: LordVorp: wrong network (oftc); there's #openplug here.
22:09  Pyista42: ./ask
22:09  thewanderer1: Pyista42: of course unless you're running under full hardware virt - under VT/SVM everything is possible :P
22:10  Pyista42: i am trying to squeeze as much power / longevity out of this vps as i can thewanderer1
22:10  thewanderer1: well, do you really need Apache?
22:11  Pyista42: well its a rails application
22:11  thewanderer1: I'd look into running it on Lighttpd and some benchmarks

22:16  thewanderer1: kaluva: Freeze is Squozen they say, so don't expect that
22:16  abrotman: kaluva: FWIW, I use AIM on squeeze, haven't had any issues with it
22:17  kaluva: thewanderer1: Yeah, but bug fixes still get in, if they are important enough. Hence my question
22:17  jon8: jelly-home well, i guess my reason behind wanting to change is b/c i just did apt-get install openssl and it installed, 0.9.8g-15+lenny9
22:17  jelly-home: jon8: is that an issue?
22:17  jon8: jelly-home my only thoughts are that, 1.0.0 wouldnt be out if there wasn't problems with other version
22:17  kaluva: abrotman: Haven't had any until today, but it's very persistent now.
22:17  thewanderer1: kaluva: Sid packages will by no means get through, perhaps just a few fixes can get backported
22:17  jon8: jelly-home there are no issues.

22:43  jhutchins_lt: I never had trouble with the slightly recessed touchpad on my toshiba, but the combination of the smaller form factor and flush trackpad on this Acer One mean I have to disable it if I'm typing.
22:43  _sho_: if i have a .deb file i need to reinstall, how do i do so
22:43  thewanderer1: jhutchins_lt: oh. I thought DSL didn't have Firefox by default
22:44  _sho_: dpkg -(what)
22:44  dpkg: _sho_: i don't know
22:44  jhutchins_lt: thewanderer1: Dunno, it's a firefox bug in any case.

22:44  jhutchins_lt: Fortunately the "lock trackpad" function key works.
22:44  thewanderer1: jhutchins_lt: regarding the touchpad issue, there's a daemon to lock it for you
22:45  jhutchins_lt: thewanderer1: That doesn't mean that other software might not have the same problem if it allows draging or gestures.

23:33  michalxo: or, where could I discuss it?
23:36  vinsci: michalxo, if it's gnome messing up, you may want to try to assign the bug to the main gnome package you have installed instead
23:37  michalxo: main gnome package? like gnome-core?
23:37  vinsci: michalxo,forget that, already done
23:37  michalxo: who did it? :-/
23:37  vinsci: Bug reassigned from package 'base' to 'gnome'. Request was from Holger Levsen <holger@layer-acht.org> to control@bugs.debian.org. (Sun, 28 Nov 2010 11:45:05 GMT) Full text and rfc822 format available.
23:38  michalxo: I had same problem/bug with ubuntu few years ago
23:38  Iridos: perhaps your keyboard is somewhat broken
23:38  michalxo: aaah nice! so it was moved :-)
23:38  michalxo: Iridos it happens just occasionally...
23:38  michalxo: just like ALT key got stuck :-/ (I am using MOD4 instead though)
23:40  Iridos: that's what can happen with loose contacts or hair cracks in the circuit board...
23:41  vinsci: or too much coke spilled on the keyboard :)
23:41  michalxo: no coke.. hair possible hmm
23:41  michalxo: but
23:41  Iridos: I'd have rated that as more permanent :-P ... but yes, it might
23:42  michalxo: when I go to TTY1-6 and back to graphical, all is ok... apart from tty-text
23:42  Iridos: you could check with ... dunno, xev, if the machine really thinks alt is pressed
23:42  michalxo: nope, xev is cool
23:43  vinsci: michalxo, in the console, if you run the reset command, does that help?
23:43  Iridos: well, he can't if he's not logged in yet
23:43  michalxo: reset command... altgr+sysrq+k?
23:43  michalxo: I was logged.. hopefully :)
23:43  jhutchins_lt: I wore the F2 key out on my last laptop.  Only way to press it was to pull off the keycap and stick something into the shaft.
23:43  vinsci: no, there's a separate program called reset that just resets the console mode
23:44  michalxo: I can't write there though :-(
23:44  vinsci: keep a session logged in, so you have it handy in advance next time, then try it out
23:44  michalxo: everything is OK, until ME (as user) log in /put my name in
23:45  Pyista42: thewanderer1: 2.6.35 is the kernel

23:46  Pyista42: for a vps why do they offer 32 bit and 64 bit?
23:46  Iridos: why shouldn't they?
23:47  Pyista42: i mean whats the advantage of having a 64 bit one?
23:47  Iridos: native addressing > 3.5GB, iirc
23:47  Iridos: ram, that is
23:47  Iridos: bigger registers...
