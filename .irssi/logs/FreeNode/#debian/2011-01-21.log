19:14  AnthLee: Makuew, yeah its lacking casper
19:14  lcb: hi all. how can i read a bash history, with the results of commands i typed (non graphical interface, only remote console with putty). i would like to check the output after issuing Perl's PHP::Serialisation library 'perl -MCPAN -e shell'
19:14  AnthLee: Makuew, I forgot about that little tidbit
19:15  jelly-hme: lcb: the history tracks your input, not the output of commands
19:16  jordanm: lcb: run it again?
19:16 --- Channel #debian was synced in 96 seconds
19:16  lcb: jelly-hme: that's what i ware affraid :( it seems lime there was an warning or error during the process
19:16  jelly-hme: judd: versions libphp-serialization-perl
19:16  judd: Package libphp-serialization-perl on i386 -- lenny: 0.27-1; sid: 0.34-1; squeeze: 0.34-1
19:17  jelly-hme: dpkg, tell lcb about dh-make-perl
19:17  lcb: jordanm: yes, i'll do it again... tks
19:17  jelly-hme: lcb: did you need a version newer than what in your debian release?
19:17  lcb: jelly-hme«  thanks a lot
19:17  jordanm: lcb: I would actually install the debian package instead, since it is available
19:18  lcb: jelly-hme: not sure; i'm following infos on how to install latest zoneminder on lenny
19:18  jelly-hme: lcb: next time you're hunting for a module from CPAN, try and see if it's packaged already: apt-cache search PHP::Serialization
19:18  lcb: zoneminder on lenny... http://www.rmacd.com/howto/zoneminder-debian-lenny-install.php
19:19  lcb: jelly-hme: sure.. i trusted the poster :)
19:19  jelly-hme: yeah.  I'm not sure why they didn't elect to use the already present package from lenny
19:20  jelly-hme: and ffmpeg from /usr/local/, srsly
19:21  jordanm: I saw that, perhaps he is bundling with ffmpeg and giving ffmpeg that install prefix?
19:21  stew: judd: versions zoneminder
19:21  judd: Package zoneminder on i386 -- lenny-multimedia: 1.24.2-3.1; squeeze: 1.24.2-7; sid: 1.24.2-8
19:21  lcb: probably... i'll keep going. last attempt i only got stuck on the mysql password.. let's see what happen now
19:22  jordanm: well, if it requires the creation of a database, you are not going to get too far without the root mysql password
19:23  lcb: judd«  : is there a way of installing it without allow sid sources?
19:23  stew: lcb: /msg dpkg dmm
19:23  lcb: ok....
19:24  lcb: thank you guys and honored gals
19:24  lcb: :)
19:26  lcb: stew, sorry for calling you judd, btw
19:27  jordanm: he is one of the authors, so close enough :)
19:27  lcb: hehehe
19:30  UukGoblin: hi guys, where can I find debconf protocol specification?
19:30  UukGoblin: the manpage at http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man3/Debconf::Client::ConfModule.3.html says it's in Debian policy, but I can't find it there
19:31  cybersphinx: Hello, is there a known problem with the squeeze installer rc with regard to proxies? I tried the netinst version, set my other machine with apt-cacher-ng as proxy, and it complained about an unknown release or something. Works without proxy, and the proxy works locally (don't have a remote installation to test atm unfortunately).
19:31  jordanm: UukGoblin: man debconf-devel
19:31  stew: UukGoblin: man 7 debconf-devel
19:32  UukGoblin: thanks
19:37  alteregoa: someone help me with mdadm.conf
19:37  alteregoa: if i type blkid i get a UUID_SUB, do i have to enter the UUID_SUB in the mdadm.conf?
19:43  jelly-hme: alteregoa: no. use /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf
19:46  alteregoa: jelly mkconf needs parameters?
19:47  txafk: how can i route through lan my public ips ?
19:47  jelly-hme: alteregoa: not that I remember
19:47  alteregoa: ok i executed it but it didnt change the line i added
19:48  alteregoa: its the blkid of md0 so its ok
19:48  alteregoa: i hope it is not that complicated to add a raid1 on root
19:49  jelly-hme: alteregoa: it outputs to stdout, doesn't change your conf file directly.  You can paste the array lines into your current mdadm.conf or overwrite it completely using shell redirection if you want
19:49  alteregoa: ah
19:49 --- D4rKr0W`afk is now known as D4rKr0W
19:49  alteregoa: so mkconf >/etc/mdadm.conf or osmething
19:49  jelly-hme: aight
19:50  alteregoa: Strange
19:51  alteregoa: it wrote ARRAY /dev/md/0 metadata=1.2
19:51  alteregoa: why those slash after /dev/md0?
19:57  txafk: need some help in routing public ips. could someone help me a bit? thanks
19:58  tharkun: txafk: man iptables and also take a google trip and research ip forwarding using iptables
19:58  txafk: i already did that for last 6 hours
19:59 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 974]
19:59  txafk: i don't need nat
20:00  xk: txafk: whats the prob?
20:00  bolt: txafk: if you're not that fluent in iptables, you could consider checking out shorewall, which does most of them for you
20:01 --- D4rKr0W is now known as D4rKr0W`afk
20:01  txafk: i have a class of 32 public ips
20:01  xk: ok
20:01  txafk: and i'd like to route them with linux
20:01  bolt: you have our permission to do so
20:01  xk: is that your only set of addresses?
20:01  txafk: 32 public ips attached to another one wich is uplink
20:02  xk: ok.
20:02  tharkun: txafk: http://ramblings.narrabilis.com/wp/ip-forward-using-iptables-port-and-host-redirect/
20:02  txafk: i don't want port forward
20:02  tharkun: !goal
20:02  dpkg: Describe your goal, not what you think the solution is.
20:02  txafk: i have full public ips
20:02  xk: ok.
20:02  xk: so on the gateway box, you have two NICs?
20:03  txafk: yes
20:03  xk: ok
20:03  txafk: eth0 is set uplink ip
20:03  txafk: and eth1 is set one ip of those 32
20:03  txafk: obviously not the first or last one
20:03  tharkun: !enter
20:03  dpkg: The enter key is not a substitute for punctuation.  Hitting enter unnecessarily makes it difficult to follow what you are saying.  Consider using ',', '. ', ';', '...', '---', or ':' instead.  If you hit enter too often, you will be autokicked by debhelper for flooding the channel.
20:03  xk: set the client machines gateway to the IP of the eth1.
20:03  txafk: i already did that
20:03  txafk: is not working
20:03  xk: firewall enabled?
20:04  txafk: on pc's ? no
20:04  xk: on gateway box
20:04  stew: txafk: is ip_forard enabled on the router?
20:04  txafk: on linux? no
20:04  txafk: it is a default installation
20:04 * tharkun hands stew a brand new W key ;P
20:04  xk: when is ip forwarding needed?
20:04  txafk: yes
20:05  txafk: is enabled with
20:05  txafk: echo 1 > /////
20:05  xk: ok, is default gateway set on gateway box?
20:05  txafk: yes as for the uplink
20:06  xk: cat  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
20:06  txafk: eth0 is set: uplink ip; netmask; gateway
20:06  txafk: on eth1 : 1st usable IP of those 32; and netmask
20:06  txafk: it is 1
20:07  xk: ok, try traceroute from gateway->google, and client->google
20:08  txafk: i have no link from client
20:08  xk: another good way to test is external->one_of_32_addresses
20:08  txafk: but from server is working
20:08  xk: why no link?
20:08  xk: pastebin
20:09  txafk: moment, checking again whole structure
20:11  xk: i got an idea i just remembered
20:12  xk: traceroute -s <eth1_address> google.com

20:36  bolt: er. how do i get apt-get to reinstall a package and include a config file i removed?
20:36  xk: apt-get install --reinstall <pkg>
20:36  jordanm: !confmiss
20:36  dpkg: The reason you have to use dpkg --force-confmiss is because whenever your config files (<conffiles>) are gone, dpkg assumes you deleted them on purpose, and that you want them to stay deleted.  You can also reinstall them using the following apt-get line: apt-get -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" --reinstall install <packagename>; or using aptitude, aptitude -o DPkg::Options::="--force-confmiss" reinstall <packagename>.
20:36  bolt: i accidentally removed shorewall.conf, and apt-get will neither install nor uninstall it because it can't find the config file
20:38  bolt: thanks :D
20:38  bolt: that did it
20:42  fbs: why gives ssh a pinenrty @ random
20:42  fbs: sometimes it wants me to enter the pass in the shell
20:42  fbs: and sometimes it gives a pinentry screen

21:00  eject_ck: Hi guys, can somebody help me to figure out if there is any security or any other reasons to block packet if src port and dst ports are the same ?
21:02  acx0: is it possible to use wildcards in aptitude? I tried issueing "aptitude remove openoffice*" but it interpreted the asterisk literally
21:03  eject_ck: I've accidently figured that my ISP blocks packets (both udp and tcp) if src port and dst port are the same
21:03  eject_ck: trying to figure why
21:04  sedulous: acx0: not very elegant but works: aptitude purge $(dpkg -l openoffice* |sed -nr 's/^ii\s+([^ ]+).*/\1/p')
21:04  acx0: sedulous, thanks, but I used "aptide remove ~nopenoffice"
21:04  sedulous: does that work, acx0?
21:05  mutante: Iceweasel vs. GNU IceCat vs. gNewSense BurningDog , could someone put an end to this and just merge those projects :p kthx , if not, can we have icecat and icecat-nonfree packages but stop inventing new names supposed to sound "unlike firefox" :p
21:05 < acx0> sedulous, ya, just found it in the man page, but thanks for the help
21:05 < sedulous> nice
21:05 < acx0> can you do "aptitude purge package" before removing it?
21:05  sedulous: mutante: good point
21:07  stew: mutante: what on earth would be in icecat-nonfree?
21:08  mutante: stew: the stuff that is in iceweasel now and GNU does not consider free, which causes them to make icecat
21:08 --- cybersphinx_ is now known as cybersphinx
21:09  stew: mutante: is there any such stuff?
21:09  mutante: arr, no, i don't know, it seems a two-sided thing:  "gNewSense excludes non-free software that Debian includes (such as non-free/proprietary firmware) and does not have repositories for non-free software (which Debian has). It should be noted, however, that gNewSense's policies allow including documentation that the Debian project considers non-free, particularly that licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License "
21:09  mutante: i wish GNU and Debian could agree on something.. seems ridiculous
21:10  mutante: and i like both
21:10  stew: don't hold your breath waiting for debian to change the social contract
21:10  thewanderer1: eject_ck: blocking packets whose src and dst port are the same is the favourite nazi admins' entertainment
21:10  sedulous: mutante: the default setup of Debian is moving more into the direction of gNewSense regarding some issues, like with the libre Linux kernel in Squeeze
21:11  stew: and as long as the social contract and the dfsg remain unchanged, debian isn't going to include non-free docs
21:11  eject_ck: thewanderer1: any other ideas ?
21:11  thewanderer1: eject_ck: no, there is absolutely no reason to restrict any IP traffic when you are an ISP
21:11  eject_ck: thewanderer1: do you have any info about this game ?
21:11  eject_ck: :)
21:12  eject_ck: problem that ISP admins said that nothing blocked in their network
21:12  thewanderer1: heh... apparently they don't know their network :P
21:22  stuckey: hi all
21:22  stuckey: Can anyone tell me why I have no sound out of my right speaker and no way to adjust the volume level, or how I can enable sound on stable?
21:23  Sicelo: stuckey: so your left speaker works? are you sure your hardware is in good shape?
21:24  stuckey: Sicelo: hardware condition isn't known -- it's older stuff.
21:25  stuckey: Sicelo: but given that I can't control the volume level, things don't seem to be normal on the software end, so I'm assuming for now that the hardware is okay and that this is a software issue.
21:25  Sicelo: have you tried alsamixer?
21:25  stuckey: Sicelo: doesn't work.
21:26  Sicelo: what happens when you run it?
21:26  stuckey: Sicelo: I'll take a screenshot
21:26  Sicelo: sure
21:28 --- the_cybersphinx is now known as cybersphinx
21:28  mutante: stew: well, i understand, sigh, i guess its just in my utopia Debian is still _the_ GNU Linux distri, because the differences are minor compared to the huge market of real non-free
21:28  mutante: and forces could be combined
21:28  stuckey: msg Sicelo http://stuckey.goat.feralhosting.com/screen.png
21:29  stuckey: Sicelo: so that's what I see here, and I can't move or adjust anything.
21:30  Sicelo: i'm still trying to open the screenshot, my connection is not so perfect here
21:32  Sicelo: up arrow and down arrow don't do anything?
21:32  stuckey: Sicelo: not a thing
21:32  stuckey: Sicelo: but, I still have high volume out of the left channel.
21:32  stuckey: Even though master shows zero, and I have no gnome volume control (it crashed and a reboot didn't bring it back).
21:33  stew: stuckey: master doesn't show zero, it shows as only a two state: mute and unmute
21:34  Sicelo: i'll be honest with you that I'm no alsa expert
21:34  Sicelo: but try man alsactl
21:34  stew: stuckey: you should be able to adjust the PCM volume
21:34  stuckey: stew: i always adjust master.
21:34  stuckey: stew: you're right, I can adjust pcm.
21:34  stew: stuckey: master isn't adjustable other than mute/unmute
21:34  stuckey: stew: it certainly is.
21:34  stew: stuckey: no, it isn't
21:35  stuckey: I've adjusted it before.
21:35  stew: stuckey: with this same card + driver + driver version combination?
21:35  stuckey: stew: no this is first time I've used this hardware.
21:35 < stew> stuckey: with this driver / card, master does not appear to be adjustable
21:35 < stew> stuckey: perhaps try a newer driver
21:36  stuckey: stew: So I should try squeeze?
21:37  stew: stuckey: no, i'd not recommend upgrading EVERYTHING for this, just the kernel first
21:37  stew: stuckey: but is this really a problem?  why not just adjust pcm?
21:37 --- D4rKr0W is now known as D4rKr0W`afk
21:37  stuckey: stew: because I only get audio out of the left channel.
21:37  stew: stuckey: is the cable all the way plugged in?
21:37  stuckey: connections are good
21:37  stew: stuckey: what happens if you turn up just the right volume?
21:38  stuckey: stew: right volume?
21:38  stew: yes, turn left to zero and right to non-zero
21:38  stuckey: stew: where?
21:39  stew: pcm
21:39  stuckey: stew: I don't know how to do this.
21:39  stew: stuckey: q/z adjusts left, e/c adjusts right, w/x adjusts both
21:39  magnus_: how can i remove a file which file name starts with -c? (-cache.lib). rm -cache.lib, rm \-cache.lib, rm "-cache.lib", rm "\-cache.lib" fails with error mv: invalid option -- 'c' .. as if it interprets the filename as a parameter
21:40  stew: magnus_: rm -- -cache.lib
21:40  stuckey: stew: I see no change in alsa when I hit those buttons.
21:40  magnus_: stew, thanks
21:40  stew: stuckey: then use amixer
21:43  stuckey: stew: why don't I have gnome vol. control in the top right?
21:43  stew: no idea
21:44  stew: i'd guess becuase you didn't add it?
21:44  stuckey: stew: it's default at install. I had it, then it crashed, and it didn't come back.
21:45  stew: what is "it" in "it crashed"?
21:46  stuckey: gnonme volume control aplet
21:46  stew: you could re-add it i guess, but there is nothing in there you can't do with alsamixer or amixer
21:47  stew: i don't know if adding it again will mean you have two the next time gnome starts, i'm not a gnome user

23:24  Allanis: apt-cache search gnome|grep -i shell

23:25  Allanis: =================
23:25  Allanis: GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for the GNOME 3

23:26  cheche: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDVz9NTjuNE
23:26  Allanis: You can have it on Debian Sid ...
23:28  cheche: Allanis: I am using squeeze, so I thought that I was close enough to test it.
23:28  jhutchins_lt: Allanis: It's actually only in experimental.
23:28  jhutchins_lt: cheche: You could set up a test partition.
23:29  jhutchins_lt: cheche: I wouldn't try to install it on a working system though.
23:29  rooisto47: I've question about the dhclient durring boot sequence (if configured), usually we cant abort that step hitting "Ctrl-c" (even in boot) but since my last (safe-upgrade) I can't do it anymore can you tell me why I can't do so ? or who to fix this ?
23:30  jhutchins_lt: rooisto47: Couls you restate your question more clearly?\

23:35  rooisto47: jhujhiti: well, when you have /etc/network/interfaces configured to use dhcp to get connected on eth0 interface, then in the boot sequence when init execute dhclient to get the ip, one are able to cancel this operation right ?! I used to do that when I'm not connected to the network (with my laptop) but sinice the last update I did it's not working anymore (it won't let me cancel the dhclient step at boot by hitting Ctrl-c) ! and I don't know why ?

23:39  jhutchins_lt: cheche: Nope.
23:39  rooisto47: jhutchins_lt, you saw my answer ?!
23:39  jhutchins_lt: cheche: Of course you could always build your own packages from source, but I would imagine it's pretty complex with lots of dependencies.  It's not just a shell, it's the next version of Gnome with all that implies.
23:40  rooisto47: jhutchins_lt, I mean my restated question
23:40  cheche: justin: but a few weeks back you could it test it apparently.
23:41  jhutchins_lt: rooisto47: You could submit a bugreport.  I would experiment with it outside of init first, and it could be due to the dependency based boot system rather than a sequential init.
23:41  Xanthor[aw]: jhutchins_lt : no, usually, with sid, dependancy problems last 1 or 2 days
23:43  rooisto47: you mean it's a known bug
23:45  rooisto47: jhutchins_lt, outside init you can cancel dhclient normally

23:55  Ergo^: where can i check to what degree debian supports newer GPU's ?
23:56  jhutchins_lt: Ergo^: Well, you can check with the manufacturer.  If they support linux then debian, being linux, will be able to support them.
23:56  jhutchins_lt: rooisto47: Sounds like it's probably due to the new boot system.
23:57  jhutchins_lt: rooisto47: I would suggest you move the configuration to network manager.
23:57  Ergo^: jhutchins_lt, i wonder if you gave me this usless advice on purpose
23:57 * Ergo^ reads xf86-video-radeonhd to answers
23:58 * jhutchins_lt suspects Ergo^ doesn't entirely understand the process.
23:58  jhutchins_lt: Not that it really matters.
