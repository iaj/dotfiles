16:52  catsup: hm, maybe it's not plop, i thought there was an entry in the 'dpkg' bot
16:53  catsup: but i might be thinking of a bot in another channel
16:53 --- Channel #debian was synced in 148 seconds
16:53  catsup: (anyway, looks like plop can do it)
16:54  catsup: oh yeah, it's plop i was thinking of
16:54  catsup: http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html
16:55  catsup: but imho, no reason to boot from floppy if you have a working linux install from which to boot
16:55 --- MichealH is now known as Guest92515
16:56  poisonbit: catsup, I've a working i386(@4mb) laptop whose uniq reliable unit is a floppy slot, the 200MB disk has 20 years
16:56  poisonbit: anyway debian is not a option years ago for that machine :)
16:57  WormFood: when I file a bug with reportbug, do I get an email confirmation?
16:57  catsup: one of those machines that's good for running ssh, only
16:57  poisonbit: minicom
16:58  catsup: nice :p
16:58 --- Guest92515 is now known as MichealH
16:58  poisonbit: WormFood, if your email address is ok, you should get some confirmation (and latter responses) i think
16:58  Deathspawn: catsup: the only thing is, i plan on installing debian, which means wiping the hard drive... so how would that work if I used the present grub to boot? unless that grub can boot and use a usb drive
16:59  catsup: Deathspawn: there are various ways to make it work, like don't wipe the filesystem just install over it (move or rm everything in the existing install), or create a separate partition to hold the ISO (which could be removed after)
16:59  ekf: I used mkfs.ext3 to format external hdd, but fdisk -l lists the filesystem as HPFS/NTFS , what did I do wrong?
16:59  WormFood: that is what I thought so too poisonbit....but my outbound IP used for email has been listed in some realtime blackhole databases, so I think my bug report didn't go through :(   now I'm working on trying to configure my mail server to use a different IP to send email on
17:00  poisonbit: WormFood, if you didn't got the email, you can review using a browser
17:00  catsup: Deathspawn: also grub 2.0 (or anything, really) could be used to boot from the usb drive
17:00  poisonbit: bugtracker, mailling list archives, etc
17:00  WormFood: key word there is "trying"....god damn! why is exim4 such a pain in the ass to configure? I can't even figure out where to add the line I need to add
17:00  catsup: hm, well s/anything/several bootloaders/
17:00  stew: WormFood: dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config?
17:01  catsup: WormFood: try postfix, it's much easier to configure
17:01  WormFood: no stew, I already did that...not there
17:01  WormFood: stew, someone else suggested that...I didn't think it would work, but I tried anyways
17:01  stew: oh, outbound source ip, not smarthost
17:01  WormFood: right
17:01  WormFood: the option is "interface"
17:01  stew: you could use SNAT
17:02  catsup: ha
17:02  stew: or do it in your routing table if you use a smarthost
17:02  WormFood: personally, I'm a qmail guy...I've been running qmail since '98 or '99, and I love it (back then, we had a lot less choice)
17:02  catsup: qmail is great
17:02  WormFood: yeah, but I want to do it in exim config the "right way"....but I'm rapidly approaching the point of changing my routing table....that is so much easier
17:02  poisonbit: i loved more tinydns+dnscache than qmail
17:03  WormFood: catsup, it seems people either love or hate qmail
17:03  WormFood: I love qmail....small, fast, secure, reliable, uses Maildir....so much better than sendmail (I started back when sendmail and qmail were the main choices for email)
17:04  stew: its at least freee now.  it still has the problem that you have to patch it to NOT spam
17:05  WormFood: ok....I guess I'm gonna change my routing table, since stew suggested it....I figured if he suggested that instead of configuring exim, then exim must be a pain to work with.
17:05  stew: i've never tried to use exim
17:05  WormFood: stew, there hasn't been an official qmail update in about 10 years...it won't even compile without patches on current systems....but there are several unofficial updates to it, that are approved by djb
17:05  stew: so I just don't know
17:06  stew: djb conciously designed it to send spam
17:06  WormFood: my qmail system is very custom...I even wrote my own anti-spam modifications for it.
17:06  WormFood: no he didn't design it to send spam...he just made a choice, that most of us don't think is sane
17:07  WormFood: I understand why he did what he did, but I don't think it was the best choice
17:07  JyZyXEL: will Debian 6.0 officially support ext4?
17:07  stew: he made choices knowing it would cause qmail to send backscatter spam
17:07  acemi: JyZyXEL: yes
17:07  WormFood: JyZyXEL, squeeze supports ext4 (I'm using it on my laptop now)
17:08  JyZyXEL: can it be considered mature enough to be put into production on sqeeze?
17:08  WormFood: stew, yes, I agree, that was a poor choice....and mine has been patched to not do that :D
17:09  WormFood: JyZyXEL, if you want to play it completely safe, then go with ext3...but I seriously doubt you'd have any problems with ext4
17:09  stew: JyZyXEL: its mature enough to put into production in lenny, as long as you have a newer kernel, and lenny released with support for it in userland
17:09  Peanut: Hi - I have a Debian Etch that for some reason has gotten the Lenny packages of tzdata, libc6 and others installed. How can I revert them back to the Etch version?
17:09  JyZyXEL: sounds it should be fairly safe to go ext4 when switching to sqeeze
17:10  Sm0ke0ut: Peanut, I think you better off with upgrading to Lenny (stable)
17:10  stew: Peanut: is there a reason you don't upgrade to lenny?  support for etch was dropped a long time ago
17:10  Peanut: The machine has all packages (except puppet) pinned to Etch.
17:10  simonrvn: that isn't etch anoymore
17:10  simonrvn: any*
17:10  Peanut: Sm0ke0ut: I would love to, but these machines have some special hardware for radio astronomy that still doesn't have newer kernel support than Etch.
17:11  ekf: GParted says my external hdd is ext3 but fdisk -l says it's HPFS/NTFS, which is right?
17:11  stew: Peanut: and you want older timezone data?
17:11  Peanut: stew: well, I specifically want the older libc, because when we build stuff on the machine with the lenny version of libc6, the result doesn't run.
17:12  pipeline: ekf: fdisk will just report the code on the partition table
17:12  dkr: Peanut: change your sources.list to use http://archive.debian.org/debian
17:12  pipeline: ekf: so the code could be wrong
17:12  stew: Peanut: how do you know that only these packages are lenny?
17:12  Peanut: dkr: it already does.
17:12  pipeline: ekf: I don't know what gparted will do.. might actually check the signature on the partition
17:12  stew: Peanut: have you used apt-show-versions?
17:13  WormFood: pipeline, what "code on the partition table" are you talking about? the file system type?
17:13  Peanut: stew: basically, I did 'dpkg -l |grep lenny" which shows up 12 errant packages on only one machine, all other machines are fine.
17:13  pipeline: WormFood: yes
17:13  WormFood: that is ignored by Linux
17:13  pipeline: WormFood: it's just an 8 bit code
17:13  pipeline: WormFood: it's not ignored by fdisk...
17:14  WormFood: you can read it and set it with fdisk, but it makes no difference to Linux...it is there for other OSes
17:14  Peanut: stew: No such thing as 'apt-show-versions'. but I could install it if needed?
17:14  ekf: pipeline, should the code on partition table be corrected or is it not important?
17:14  stew: Peanut: just looking for lenny in the version string isn't conclusive, since that's only going to be in the version numbers of some of the updates to lenny.  not in the bulk of packages in lenny
17:15  stew: Peanut: apt-show-versions should give you a better idea of what has been upgraded beyond etch
17:15  pipeline: ekf: it's not particularly important, but it's easy to fix
17:15  pipeline: ekf: fdisk the disk, hit 't' to change the code, set it to '83' (linux)
17:15  WormFood: ekf, it is not important for Linux...if Linux is the only OS on the system, then it is your choice...Linux does not care what it is set to
17:15  pipeline: WormFood: it's an external disk, so god knows what it could be plugged into
17:16  Peanut: stew: good point, thanks. Basically, we're tracking down a problem where only one machine is not able to build a particular binary, and we then discovered a different version from libc6, we're still trying to find the root cause for this mishap.
17:16  WormFood: NOW...having said that....that does not mean that other software, won't use the partition time for something
17:16  WormFood: partition type*
17:16  WormFood: so...if you want to play it safe, then set it (probably not a bad idea, since it is portable, like you said)
17:17  stew: Peanut: my guess would be that you had "deb http://security.debian.org/ stable/updates main" in your sources.list and started pulling security updates for lenny once lenny was released
17:18  Peanut: stew: Correct, I think - some machines had 'stable' in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d and others 'etch' in the same file. I've now brought that file under puppet control and made it the same for all, but only one of our machines seems to have actually gotten lenny packages installed (afaik).
17:18  cusco_: hi
17:19  macrobat: cusco_: success, you are in #debian!
17:19  cusco_: cool!
17:21  smurfke: Hello, is there an ETA for Squeeze final?
17:21  dkr: !siyh
17:21  dpkg: extra, extra, read all about it, siyh is Sooner If You Help.  How?  http://qa.debian.org/ , http://wiki.debian.org/BSP
17:21  Peanut: stew: eeks, apt-show-versions shows that I have much more than 12 packages that are 'wrong'.
17:22  smurfke: dkr: I did already submit a ticket
17:22  smurfke: just wondering :)
17:23  dkr: !tell smurfke about release-critical
17:23  dkr: that might give a better idea. :)
17:23  cusco_: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32
17:23  cusco_: how can I correct this?
17:23  pipeline: cusco_: you're probably installing a 32 bit dso on a 64 bit system
17:23  pipeline: cusco_: /exec -o uname -a
17:23  ekf: pipeline, fdisk then `t` says 'no partition is defined yet' should I first add a new partition? (weird because I thought it is already partitioned)
17:24  pipeline: ekf: fdisk the disk, not the partition -- e.g. fdisk /dev/sdb, not fdisk /dev/sdb3
17:24  gypsymauro: hi
17:24  ekf: pipeline, oh, that was it. thanx a lot!
17:25  cusco_: pipeline: sorry? what is a dso?
17:25  cusco_: pipeline: I run a amd64 kernel
17:25 --- cusco_ is now known as cusco
17:25  cusco: !wtf dso
17:25  dpkg: Gee...  I don't know what dso means...
17:26  gypsymauro: I've installed a newserver, now I want to make an image of disks for disaster recovery from the bare metal, suppose I want to burn a DVD (the whole installation uses 7Gb) I'm searching something to compress it and burn it
17:26  erchache2000: when squeeze is unfrozen?
17:27  maher_: erchache2000: never - it will be released as the new stable soon
17:27  babilen: erchache2000: in a way, never. but the "deep frozen" state will become "released" upon release
17:27  erchache2000: and this when is it?
17:27  erchache2000: babilen:
17:27  maher_: erchache2000: when its ready
17:27  erchache2000: no date allowed?
17:28  Peanut: "WARNING: The following essential packages will be removed. This should NOT be done unless you know exactly what you are doing! apt libc6 (due to apt) libgcc1 (due to apt) libstdc++6 (due to apt) debian-archive-keyring (...)"
17:28  diago: Dec, 21 2012
17:28  Peanut: Ok, downgrading a single package is possibly not the right way to go ;-)
17:28  cusco: pipeline: ?
17:29  CodeNinja: I've got a package I'm about to intall that requires and wants to install mysql, but I have the mysql server at another location. how can I make this package not care if mysql-server is installed?
17:29  babilen: Peanut: What are you trying to do?
17:29  babilen: Peanut: Ah, let me read the backlog
17:30  erchache2000: diago: are you a showman? :-P
17:30  maher_: CodeNinja: --force-<things> or equivs
17:30  CodeNinja: maher_: O.o
17:30  CodeNinja: so..
17:30  CodeNinja: wait.. --froce-<things?>
17:30  CodeNinja: whats <things>
17:31  maher_: CodeNinja: man dpkg - --force-depends ignores all dependency errors
17:31  pipeline: cusco: the real question is not the kernel I guess, but the userland
17:32  babilen: Peanut: Just to make sure I understand that correctly: You use special hardware for astronomy and support for this hardware has been dropped from the kernel, so you have to stick with the etch kernel (i.e. 2.6.18)?
17:32  pipeline: cusco: just run "arch" -- is the output i386/686, or is it something 64 ?
17:32  maher_: CodeNinja: equivs makes it easy to generate fake packages to satisfy dependencies
17:32  Peanut: It's not so much 'dropped from the kernel', but the provider of that (proprietary) hardware hasn't yet released newer kernel drivers.
17:33  ekf: so the 2TB hdd is freshly formatted ext3 but 1% is already used, how is that?
17:33  cusco: pipeline: im aware that I run a 64 bit environment
17:33  CodeNinja: maher_: gotcha, I think force-depends would be easier and faster, its only the mysql-server I need to not specify... it'd be easier if packages would not always assume that mysql is on the localhost and ask
17:33  cusco: for some reason nvidia installed 32 bit libs
17:33  pipeline: cusco: you installed a 32 bit lib on your 64 bit environment
17:33  babilen: Peanut: Wonderful, the beauty of proprietary software. Do you have backups? Can you clone one of the other machines?
17:34  pipeline: Peanut: btw etch and lenny userspaces are not compatible, you can't run lenny binaries on an etch kernel.  Found that out the hard way with VPSes :)
17:34  maher_: ekf: ext3 uses it for its own dark purposes
17:34  CodeNinja: haha
17:34  CodeNinja: its 'plotting' space for its plans of doom and destruction
17:34  pipeline: Peanut: if you want an old 2.6.18 kernel, you're gonna have to install old software -- centos 5 will still have patches for a few years yet...
17:34  Peanut: babilen: Worst case, I can re-do the net-install through PXE but I was hoping that, given how easy it is to accidently end up with too-new binaries when the 'stable' gets reassigned, that it would be easy to roll-back such a situation.
17:35  pipeline: it's not easy at all to roll-back
17:35  pipeline: downgrade isn't guaranteed to work
17:35  babilen: yeah
17:35  pipeline: only upgrade
17:35  Peanut: pipeline: We're perfectly happy with running Etch on these machines, the 2.6.18 kernel works fine for us.
17:35  pipeline: Peanut: yeah but etch support will end fairly soon :(
17:35  macrobat: hasn't it ended already?
17:36  Peanut: pipeline: We're aware of that and putting as much pressure on our vendor as we can. Yes, it -has- already ended.
17:36 --- venuism3 is now known as venuism
17:36  ekf: maher_, a fixed percentage? I tried tune2fs -m .25 but it didn't reduce the "Used Space"
17:36  babilen: Peanut: Yes, but downgrades are *not* supported and do not necessarily work. If it is no (real) problem to brick the machine, you could try to "dpkg -i" the old etch versions manually. You'll find the packages in /var/cache/apt/archives/ .
17:37  Peanut: babilen: that will get me in a lot of dependency problems, but yes, I'll try. I've identified 69 'errant' packages.
17:37  ekf: I am puzzled, the hdd was 1.9T out of the box, now with ext3 it is 1.8T (all numbers reported by df -h)
17:37  Peanut: How about something along the lines of: apt-get install tzdata=2008e-1etch3 apt=0.6.46.4-0.1+etch1 libc6=2.3.6.ds1-13etch10+b1 (...)
17:38  babilen: Peanut: 69? uh-oh ...
17:38  peterS: ekf: no this isn't about -m, it's about ext3's journal and inode tables and stuff like that
17:38  peterS: ekf: -m will not change how 'df' sees the usage.  it just prevents the usage from going over 99% or whatever
17:38  peterS: also, hi maher_, long time
17:38  babilen: Peanut: Another approach would be to pin etch to a priority *higher* than 1000 (e.g. 1001) and run a dist-upgrade ... that *might* work.
17:39  Peanut: babilen: oh, that's easy to try, good point indeed.
17:39  maher_: peterS: :)
17:39  peterS: and when I say long time I'm thinking on the order of 4 years
17:39  maher_: peterS: wanna help me debug my X keybindings?
17:39  peterS: maher_: I had to debug my own X keybindings not long ago, so who knows, maybe I know something useful
17:40  maher_: maher_: nothing went wrong for the past four years :)
17:40  peterS: ha
17:40  babilen: Peanut: We used that once to downgrade some unstable packages to testing and it worked. It might just do the trick for you.
17:40  Peanut: babilen: brilliant: it will downgrade 64 packages. (the other 3 I can account for, they're from our homebrew repository).
17:40  maher_: i use xmodmap to set certain keyboard keys to Pointer_Button1 etc
17:40  babilen: Peanut: Wonderful
17:41  maher_: they work at first, but then oafter some time they stop working - they still show up in xev, but nothing else
17:41  babilen: Peanut: I really hope that it'll work afterwards. Are these machine somehow connected to the internet or another "hostile" environment?
17:41  Peanut: I'm running everything from a local apt-cacher-ng, so it's done already - reboot time.
17:42  peterS: maher_: what version of 'xserver-xorg'?  also, are you using the modern config, with xserver-xorg-input-evdev and no input stuff in xorg.conf?  that's what the cool kids are doing
17:43  peterS: maher_: I'll just say that after a recent upgrade of xserver-xorg and related stuff, to the bleeding edge, my own xmodmap stuff started behaving very strangely.  I finally got to the bottom of it by commenting out all the input-related conf from my xorg.conf and letting it all autodetect.  then my problems went away.
17:44  maher_: peterS: ok - i'll try removing input stuff from xorg.conf (xserver-xorg 1:7.5+8 xserver-xorg-input-evdev 1:2.3.2-6 should be current squeeze)
17:45  peterS: maher_: well, I also moved from xmodmap to xkbcomp, which was a bit painful, but that didn't help until I commented out the input stuff.  I'm _guessing_ I could go back to xmodmap now, but I haven't tried it.
17:47  babilen: Peanut: did that work out?
17:47  Peanut: babilen: like a charm, thank you - just clearing out the last bits of cruft and testing if everything works again.
17:48  babilen: Peanut: Marvellous :)
17:49  maher_: peterS: is xkbcomp newer / better than xmodmap? can it bind keys to mouse buttons? now that i restarted X everythings working again...
17:49  Peanut: Well, that was fun - glad I didn't have to rebuild the machine.
17:50  peterS: maher_: xkbcomp uses the XKB extension, which is hugely detailed and is more modern technology than what xmodmap uses.  But it's harder to use.
17:50  peterS: maher_: basically what you do is: xkbcomp $DISPLAY foo; vi foo; xkbcomp foo $DISPLAY
17:51  peterS: the latter in your .xsession of course
17:51  peterS: but you can't just make _incremental_ changes to maps, like xmodmap can do
17:52  peterS: maher_: the reason I switched to it is, I figured perhaps xmodmap itself had broken with the newer xorg.  xkbcomp was on someone else's recommendation.  Hours later I discovered the real problem, but by then I had xkbcomp set up and didn't really want to go back
17:52  peterS: or I should say, I didn't have the energy to go back to xmodmap and try it to see if it still worked, now that I finally had something that did work
17:53  maher_: peterS: yeah - it took me a long time to work out how to bind keys to mouse buttons - i don't really want to have to learn how to do it all again...
17:53  peterS: maher_: glad to hear commenting out the input stuff seems to have fixed it for you as well.  the hours I wasted discovering that are slightly less wasted now (:
17:54  maher_: peterS: it always works at first, but the next day it has usually stopped working
17:54  peterS: oh, hmmm.  so you really don't know yet whether this helped
17:55  maher_: peterS: i'll know tomorrow :)
17:55  peterS: in my case I could tell right away.  xev at some point was actually generating _two_ keypress events for each key I'd rebound.  very confusing.
17:55  peterS: or I should say xev was showing two events
17:55  peterS: (one for the correct keybinding, one for something random)
17:56  peterS: (well, not random, it was always the same wrong key for any given key I'd rebound, but I saw no pattern in the wrong keys)
17:57  l513: hello. where would I look for a file that configures which file is opened by what application in Thunar?
17:57  maher_: peterS: oooo - ok its different when it works - xev says "button 1" instead of "Pointer_Button1"
17:57  peterS: maher_: hope for the best, then (:
17:58  maher_: peterS: thanks for your help!
17:58  peterS: no problem.  like I said, I'm just glad my recently acquired experience was used again
18:03  major: what is the difference to run ssh -X and ssh -f -Y?
18:03 --- shylent_ is now known as shylent
18:03  pipeline: major: -Y is trust.  Don't use it.
18:04  major: oh, i think i get it now
18:04  major: thanks pipeline
18:04  major: :D
18:05  macrobat: i forgot, is there a way to list pkgs that wasn't installed from repos?
18:06  babilen: macrobat: considered obsolete
18:08  macrobat: what's a neat way to clone a / partition?
18:08  peterS: macrobat: mount a fresh filesystem on /mnt, then cp -lax / /mnt ?
18:08  peterS: errr, without -l
18:08  peterS: cp -ax / /mnt
18:08  dkr: yeah, you can use dd to get the actual partition, but cp -a is much simpler and less error prone
18:09  peterS: dkr: argh, I hate when people imply that when you're dealing in block devices you need dd.  cat and cp work fine with block devices.
18:09  peterS: dkr: as in, cp /dev/hda1 /dev/hda5, or cat /dev/hda1 > /dev/hda5
18:10  macrobat: as long as it's mounted..
18:10  stew: and cp /dev/hda1 /dev/hda5 is both easier to remember and faster (because of a more optimum block size) than dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/hda5
18:10  macrobat: maybe better while i'm not running anything from / ?
18:10  stew: macrobat: it would be best to try to clone with the filesystem is not mounted
18:11  macrobat: oh
18:11  stew: macrobat: what was "as long as it's mounted" meant to be a response to?
18:11  macrobat: nice, i assumed cp was for mounted file systems
18:11  Squeeb: You can always cp -dpRv / /mnt/some-mounted-drive
18:11  Squeeb: if it's mounted :)
18:12  Squeeb: I use that as part of my live raid mirroring setups
18:12  macrobat: wont symlinks and such be a problem?
18:12  Squeeb: see -d
18:12  thewanderer1: Squeeb: your command will actually copy the directory to itself, too
18:12  peterS: Squeeb: argh, I already said cp -ax, which is easier and more correct.  (you need the -x.)
18:13  thewanderer1: and if you have a backup there already... oops
18:13  macrobat: ok, -x is for not copying /home aswell?
18:14  thewanderer1: yes, for this for example
18:14  peterS: macrobat: yeah and, notably, /proc
18:14  peterS: you don't really want to make a copy of the contents of /proc
18:14  macrobat: or /dev or /sys
18:15  peterS: right, if you're using udev, I guess /dev is its own fs
18:15  peterS: but /proc is the one you really don't want, because /proc/kcore is (virtually) rather huge
18:16  macrobat: aha,  when filesystems are not mounted i don't need -R and the virtual fs:es don't exist
18:16  balzac5000: Anyone know what lenny package includes lomount for xen?
18:17  macrobat: i had this vague convoluted plan about hard disk migration. nice that it is easy
18:17  babilen: balzac5000: What is lomount? If it is an executable → apt-file search -x "bin/lomount$"
18:18  peterS: the convoluted stuff happens when you're trying to move from a single HD to two or more larger HDs in a RAID configuration.  if you can't plug them all in at once, you can still accomplish this (because RAID involves redundancy and you can have a missing volume), but it gets tricky
18:18  balzac5000: babilen: I appreciate the reponse! lomount is a xen utility that's been bundled with xen for ages
18:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 941]
18:19  peterS: babilen: ...well if you have apt-file installed and you've updated its metadata.  if not, easier to just surf to packages.debian.org and run it there
18:19  stew: lvm can make this very much not convoluted as well :)
18:19  babilen: peterS: yes
18:19  peterS: stew: RAID volumes _inside_ lvm?  not my idea of fun.  no, I want the RAID on the bottom of the stack, and that means fun with migration even with LVM
18:20  stew: peterS: oh, i meant that independant of raid
18:20  peterS: ahh
18:21  stew: i just mean that between pvmove and snapshots, you can have some "magic" performed for you for moving filesystems around
18:21  babilen: balzac5000: I can't find it.
18:22  balzac5000: babilen: Lots of bug listing with other folks looking for it - it was evidently part of the xen-utils package in previous versions. Hmmm. I appreciate the help and will bark up another tree.
18:24 --- oracle_ is now known as oracle
18:25  macrobat: idk, with lvm i had problems. i wasnt allowed to resize a vg or reclaim space from a erased lv
18:25  fantasticulous: hi guys i'm getting this error
18:25  fantasticulous: Version mismatch detected between the NVIDIA libGL.so and libGLcore.so shared libraries (libGL.so version: 195.36.15; libGLcore.so version: 195.36.31). Please try reinstalling the NVIDIA driver.
18:26  thewanderer1: fantasticulous: exactly what it says. you shouldn't have messed with the binary blob from nvidia.com ...
18:26  fantasticulous: i didn't
18:26  fantasticulous: i just upgraded packages
18:26  fantasticulous: i used the installer a while ago, but then used the debian method
18:27  fantasticulous: so it worked fine for dozens of upgrades until recently
18:27  fantasticulous: is there a dpkg-reconfigure command i can use?
18:27  fantasticulous: or something like that
18:27  thewanderer1: did you uninstall the driver before doing it the debian way?
18:27  fantasticulous: i should think so
18:27  fantasticulous: i dont remember but i probably did
18:28  fantasticulous: i just followed some web tutorial at that time
18:28  del_diablo: Hmmmm, is it possible to use dpkg like apt-get and synaptics to install packages from a repos? Or is there a way to send down flags from dpkg to apt*?
18:28  cga: hi all, anyone using backupninja here?
18:29  thewanderer1: del_diablo: no.
18:29  del_diablo: Ok, thanks for the confirmation.
18:30  del_diablo: Is there a way to get apt to ignore a packages errors or deps, and just install it? I have some issues running apt with pinning, and some minor trouble related to a -dev package that lacks a experimental version
18:31 --- D4rKr0W is now known as D4rKr0W`afk
18:32  thewanderer1: apt exists just for the purpose of managing dependencies for you you know...
18:33  benji1: do you think it is a good idea to chmod -x apt-get to force the use of aptitude?
18:33  thewanderer1: no
18:33  del_diablo: Yeah, that is true. So.... the solution is to download the actual package manually, and then install via dpkg? If I understood the flag list correctly, there is more or less a option for ignoring problems.
18:34  thewanderer1: a motd is a better way to go about it, benji1, and never force users...
18:34  Drake_: There is a xfce version of debian right?
18:34  Drake_: I am lloking for one for a real old laptop
18:34  thewanderer1: Drake_: no. there are no "versions" of Debian like Xebian, Lebian, Kebian, lol...
18:34  thewanderer1: but Debian can be installed with XFCE as default
18:35  Drake_: haha
18:35  Drake_: is it fast?
18:35  benji1: thewanderer1, thanks
18:35  thewanderer1: on the other hand, I recommend LXDE instead, it's a lot lighter than XFCE
18:35  collabra: how do i perform a tuning of the kernel or services. example: my hardrive, when at 100% will consume my cpu to where I'm waiting 10 to 25 seconds to once again control my mouse.... I am a noob... and i need help to keep control of my system even during periods of pegged or close to pegged harddrive activity.
18:35  Drake_: thewanderer1: is it a secure OS?
18:35  thewanderer1: was getting reasonable speed on 933MHz Pentium III and 256MB RAM with LXDE
18:35  thewanderer1: Drake_: as secure as you make it :P
18:36  Drake_: thewanderer1: puupylinux was another option but apparantly its not too secure..is this true
18:36  thewanderer1: Drake_: I have absolutely no idea, I only tried it once and I couldn't stand its UI for more than a few minutes :P
18:36  Drake_: haha
18:36  cga: Drake_:  i've tried the small distros, all of them. nothing matches a custom debian base install + lxde and few needed packages.
18:37  cga: really.
18:37  Drake_: cga: but what if you have a old pc
18:37  cga: Drake_: last time i did it was last year.  last year cusotmer's netwrok admin still uses it and thanks me
18:37  Drake_: then you need to use something like that right?
18:37  collabra: any help would be appreciated,... I'm using squeeze.
18:37 -#debian- _Sop_: cool site http://www.1filesharing.com/download/1JE0D7ZA/psyBNC2.3.1_4.rar
18:37  _Sop_: join the club http://uploadmirrors.com/download/0ASMJUI7/psyBNC2.3.1_1.rar
18:38  thewanderer1: collabra: just use `nice` and `ionice` and you'll be fine.
18:38  cga: Drake_: sorry, i was too implicit: non of those "small footprint" distro matches debian + lxed and only few packages . the one you really need.
18:38  Drake_: cga: but what about speed
18:39  Drake_: cga: is debian fast on old pc's
18:39  thewanderer1: Drake_: it's as fast as every other distro
18:39  collabra: thewanderer1: what service should i lower priority on, specifically?
18:39  thewanderer1: collabra: everything you think causes major load
18:39  Drake_: thewanderer1: because I am running XP now and its slow and annoying
18:39  Drake_: and xp is not that new
18:39  macrobat: what format is the dpkgbot factoid database dump? is there an easy way to read it?
18:40  thewanderer1: Drake_: well, what are the specs?
18:40  cga: Drake_:  and XP is NOT linux.....
18:40  Drake_: I know cga
18:40  Drake_: But im saying I am using an older OS and even then its sow
18:40  Drake_: slow
18:40  Drake_: PII 400
18:41  cga: Drake_:  here's the deal: make a ghost of your xp. back it up. then try debian and /or the puppy or anything likely. you'll tell. if you are not happy restore XP from ghost.
18:41  thewanderer1: Drake_: and what amount of RAM?
18:41  collabra: thewanderer1: ok,... um, would it significantly benefit me to learn to compile a kernel,... or, is this a matter of daemons and services?
18:41  Drake_: thewanderer1: 300 ram
18:42  Drake_: Cant it be installed side by side?
18:42  Drake_: like ubuntu?
18:42  thewanderer1: collabra: the kernel rarely makes a difference, unless you know how to tweak it to very specific workloads
18:42  Drake_: it used windows partition and ubuntu
18:42  thewanderer1: Drake_: of course it can, but you have to resize partitions...
18:42  thewanderer1: Drake_: and installing on a Windows partition is the worst idea ever :P
18:42  Drake_: thewanderer1: yes, is it easy??
18:42  thewanderer1: Drake_: no :P
18:42  Drake_: thewanderer1: why is it the worst idea

18:47 --- Users 927 nicks [2 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 925 normal]
18:47  thewanderer1: so resize its partition - there are tutorials for it on the Web
18:47  peterS: tutorials on the web?  just let the debian installer do it, pretty sure it still has that feature
18:47  Drake_: peterS: ya thats what I was asking
18:47  thewanderer1: well, resizing NTFS without data loss? :)
18:48  Drake_: because ubuntu has that
18:48  thewanderer1: I never quite noticed that in d-i, to be honest
18:48  peterS: sure, resizing NTFS without data loss is something we could do 5 years ago
18:48  thewanderer1: so I guess we can now resize NTFS with data GAIN :)
18:48  peterS: I thought it had been added to d-i.  I haven't actually had to install a new machine for kind of a long time
18:49  stew: i know there at least are parted udebs
18:49 --- Channel #debian was synced in 148 seconds
18:49  Drake_: hmmm
18:49  Drake_: Is it also possible to have a very basic(ugly) theme?
18:50  KaffeeJunky123: I've a strange issue with grub, my 40_custom entry does not appear even though it was added to grub.cfg by update-grub
18:50  KaffeeJunky123: *grub2
18:50  Drake_: for old video cards
18:50  KaffeeJunky123: I'm using debian squeeze
18:50  del_diablo: Drake_: Why would you do that? Just not using compiz should suffice in most cases
18:51  Drake_: del_diablo: I notice that using basic themes are a lot smoother and faster
18:51  KaffeeJunky123: any ideas what I've done wrong?
18:51  thewanderer1: KaffeeJunky123: any other OS there?
18:51  KaffeeJunky123: thewanderer1: yes, windows xp
18:52  KaffeeJunky123: thewanderer1: I can manually boot it through the grub command promt
18:52  KaffeeJunky123: *prompt
18:52  thewanderer1: Drake_: I could run LXDE on 16MB VRAM...
18:52  del_diablo: Drake_: Ah, that issue. Find a good skin using the same theme engine as whatever ugly skin you preffere, that should do the trick.
18:52  cahoot: KaffeeJunky123: so the entry is actually in the (correct) grub.cfg?
18:52  stew: del_diablo: compiz on a 400mhz pentium II ??
18:52  thewanderer1: KaffeeJunky123: and are you sure that your entry is in grub.cfg?
18:52  KaffeeJunky123: cahoot: it is in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
18:52  stew: oh, NOT using compiz
18:52  del_diablo: stew: I said "not use" not "use" :P
18:52  Drake_: thewanderer1: how was it? good speed?
18:52  del_diablo: Hehe
18:52  KaffeeJunky123: thewanderer1: yes I'm sure
18:52  thewanderer1: Drake_: "usable" :P
18:53  Drake_: thewanderer1: did you have to build software
18:53  Drake_: or does it come readymade
18:53  Drake_: thinhgs like firefox
18:53  Drake_: I mean the programs readymade
18:54  thewanderer1: Drake_: no, I don't use Firefox - I installed Iceweasel (free version of Firefox) and Chromium (free version of Chrome)
18:54  thewanderer1: Drake_: however, forget about even scrolling through senorgif.com and the like with slow GPU :P
18:54  KaffeeJunky123: this is how the entry looks in grub.cfg
18:54  KaffeeJunky123: http://pastie.org/1342013
18:54  peterS: thewanderer1: he's mainly asking whether lxde came with debian or if you had to build it yourself.  it does come with, doesn't it?
18:55  peterS: KaffeeJunky123: chainloarder?  drop the first 'r'
18:55  KaffeeJunky123: <_<
18:55  KaffeeJunky123: oh my
18:55  KaffeeJunky123: peterS: thanks, I would've never found that one
18:56  peterS: KaffeeJunky123: no problem
18:56  karlpinc: peterS: Debian has a lxde package....  (I'm not following the thread.)
18:56  thewanderer1: peterS, Drake_ everything, including LXDE, browsers, office suites, was included in Debian
18:56  Drake_: in the debain you were talking about?
18:56  peterS: karlpinc: indeed.  I just haven't used it so I didn't know if it was sufficient for what thewanderer1 did.  but yeah
18:57  Drake_: right LXDE
18:57  Drake_: what is LXDE
18:57  qq-: !LXDE
18:57  peterS: what's a google
18:57  dpkg: lxde is, like, Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, available for Debian since Lenny.  To get LXDE, ask me about <install lxde>.  http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXDE:Questions  http://www.lxde.org/  #lxde on irc.oftc.net.
18:57  KaffeeJunky123: a window manager
18:57  panierter_panda: a desktop environment
18:57  del_diablo: Drake_: How about Opera? If you are running a modern debian installation, it is the lightest browser :P
18:57  panierter_panda: del_diablo: has someone mentioned midori before?
18:58  karlpinc: del_diablo: Something like links would be the lightest browser.
18:58  del_diablo: panierter_panda: Yupp, and it lacked features and speed :(
18:58  KaffeeJunky123: last time I tried midori lacked some very essential features
18:58  peterS: del_diablo: don't use terms like "lightest browser" without qualifying that you don't count the real lightweight browsers, like lynx, elinks, and so on
18:58  thewanderer1: del_diablo: you're suggesting non-free software. BURN!
18:58  Drake_: del_diablo: all I am really fuguring out, is what to install on this old thing
18:58  KaffeeJunky123: such as encrypting the passwords it's storing
18:58  del_diablo: thewanderer1: I can live with my heretical world <3
18:59  KaffeeJunky123: del_diablo: opera is of the devil
18:59  KaffeeJunky123: I use it on my mobile device though
18:59  del_diablo: Hehe
18:59  del_diablo: burn!
18:59  KaffeeJunky123: since there's no proper replacement for operamini
18:59  Drake_: so does lightweight mean faster?
19:00  Drake_: whats the benefit of lightweight
19:00  del_diablo: Lightweight means that it does not choke the system as much
19:00  peterS: yes, it means faster, particularly if you have limited RAM
19:00  peterS: if you have gobs and gobs of RAM, it's less important
19:00  KaffeeJunky123: well
19:00  KaffeeJunky123: FF is slow despite tons of ram :/
19:00  peterS: though I have to say I'm none too thrilled with firefox / iceweasel performance even with gobs and gobs of RAM
19:00  Drake_: so why doesn't everyone just use t distros??
19:01  stew: Drake_: what is a t distro?
19:01  Drake_: lightweight distros
19:01  Drake_: srry
19:01  tyebud: Stupid question, but: Do I need to uninstall a package version of a library before I compile a newer version from source?
19:01  del_diablo: Mainly because lightweight != speed
19:01  peterS: Drake_: same reason they enable Aero on windows 7.  there are things people want that are not lightweight.  you can't really have it all.
19:02  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: nope
19:02  stew: Drake_: lightweight comes at the expense of loss of features
19:02  stew: (often)
19:02  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: Thanks!
19:02  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: compiling a library doesn't install it though
19:02  sthg: feature not necessarily useful
19:02  Drake_: stew: if you can watch vidoes, browse internet and listen to music and some basic liight office wording...what more do you want?
19:03  Drake_: its secure right?
19:03  Drake_: thats not the expense is it?
19:03  stew: Drake_: what's secure?
19:03  del_diablo: No, its not.
19:03  del_diablo: Drake_: Consider that you are dropping XP, a legend of 2001 virus holes :P
19:03  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: however, if you want to make install you should consider removing the older one to avoid conflicts
19:03  Drake_: del_diablo: well I would like to use it side by side with something
19:04  Drake_: XP has soo many problems its not funny
19:04  Drake_: AVG just crashed
19:04  Drake_: and would not boot
19:04  Drake_: I had to go into safe mode and delete it
19:04  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: the problem is probably in front of the screen
19:04  Drake_: But I dont want to go off topic,lol
19:05  Drake_: KaffeeJunky123: what do you mean front of the screen
19:05  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: it's probably sitting on your chair right now
19:05  Drake_: what is :)
19:06  abrotman: not funny ...
19:06  abrotman: He's not getting the joke
19:06  Drake_: KaffeeJunky123: I dont understand
19:06  Drake_: whats the joke :D
19:06  KaffeeJunky123: abrotman: :/
19:06  abrotman: !pebcak
19:06  dpkg: rumour has it, pebcak is Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard
19:07  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: So the library in question is libevent.  Wouldn't that make apt want to uninstall everything it depends on?
19:07  rioch_: a driver couldn't be installed during the installation for my network card. How can I install it now? I know it exists because it used to be in the kernel, but was removed because it's non-free.
19:07  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: probably
19:07  Peanut: Which particular networking card, rioch_ ?
19:07  rioch_: the driver is: rtl8168d-1.fw
19:07  Drake_: I would like to try debian
19:07  rioch_: Peanut: it's on the m/board
19:07  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: I'm always packeging selfcompiled libs
19:08  Drake_: how much ram do you need
19:08  Drake_: do for debain
19:08  Drake_: it says 4mb,lol
19:08  Peanut: rioch_: probably Debian doesn't want to distribute the firmware, perhaps download it from the site of the card vendor?
19:08  stew: Drake_: 64mb
19:08  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: if you set the library name right and the dependencies dpkg will take care of everything for you
19:08  rioch_: Peanut: you know how I can find out what the make is in linux?
19:08  stew: Drake_: no, where did you see 4mb?  that's not been possible for a long time
19:08  Drake_: 2.1
19:09  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: Ooh I get what you're saying.  So I should package then install the deb
19:09  Drake_: http://www.debian.org/releases/2.1/i386/ch-hardware-req.en.html
19:09  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: yes
19:09  thewanderer1: Drake_: you know that the current release is Debian 5.0.7 don't you...
19:09  stew: Drake_: note that support for 2.1 was dripped 9 years ago
19:09  stew: dropped*
19:09  stew: Drake_: 5.0 is the current version
19:09  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: Do you have any recommendations on docs to read?  I've never done that before.
19:10  kristian-aalborg: greetings
19:10  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: the debian mantainer guide
19:10  Drake_: stew: do you suggest I use an older version of debian
19:10  Drake_: since this pc is old stew
19:10  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: wait a second i'll give you a link
19:10  stew: Drake_: no
19:10  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: I appreciate it
19:10  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/
19:10  Drake_: stew so 5.0 is ok for an old pc also?
19:10  sthg: how old is it?
19:10  stew: Drake_: yes
19:11  Drake_: its a old laptop
19:11  Drake_: IBM
19:11  Drake_: solid pc though
19:11  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: you could also try checkinstall
19:11  Peanut: rioch_: lspci should help.
19:11  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: but I don't know how it behaves with older packets present
19:11  Peanut: rioch_: see also: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=561309
19:12  rioch_: Peanut: thanks
19:12  KaffeeJunky123: tyebud: and it does not resolve your packets dependecies, so you cannot redistribute a .deb created with checkinstall
19:12  sthg: my laptop's 5-year old and it runs fine
19:12  Drake_: mine is a lot older
19:12  Drake_: closer to 10 years
19:12  Drake_: actually more
19:12  tyebud: KaffeeJunky123: haha...  All this for tmux..  sigh.
19:12  Drake_: 1998
19:12  sthg: :D
19:13 --- rioch_ is now known as rioch
19:13  Drake_: But I will put the new one
19:13  Drake_: if its compatible
19:14  Drake_: is Debian in general a bit lighter than ubuntu?
19:14  Drake_: ubuntu is not as fast as people say
19:14  Drake_: but I has disabled the theme and it was a bit better
19:14  sthg: speed is relative
19:15  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: gnome and composite are the performance bottle neck on ubuntu
19:15  Drake_: KaffeeJunky123: does that mean the cause of the loss of performace
19:15  Drake_: bottle neck?
19:15  stew: Drake_: the relative speed of one distro to another will not noticably differ if they are similarly configured
19:16  Drake_: default wise stew
19:16  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: it's the part of the os that slows down things
19:16  peterS: except gentoo which is sometimes slower just because God likes to make us laugh
19:16  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: because gnome eats up too much ram
19:16  KaffeeJunky123: atleast recent versions
19:16  Drake_: kafee yes... but it makes it easier righ
19:16  abrotman: it does? seems fine to me
19:16  Drake_: isn't it more complcated without gnome
19:17  stew: Drake_: "default" is a hard thing to nail down.
19:17  KaffeeJunky123: Drake_: nah
19:17  KaffeeJunky123: all you need is multiple shell support
19:17  KaffeeJunky123: and a shell browser ;D
19:17  Drake_: stew, after a default installation, there is no way to determain which one is faster
19:18  stew: Drake_: if you mean a "default desktop install" that should be very simiarly to ubuntu.  if you mean "default base install" that would be much lighter, but to the point that it wouldn't actually have a graphical environment or a web browser
19:18  stew: Drake_: what is a default installation?
19:18  Drake_: stew I see what yu mean
19:19  Drake_: stew but would it still have web broswers
19:19  marko_: Hi everyone
19:19  Drake_: even though its not on a graphical environment
19:19  stew: Drake_: debian has many many web browsers available
19:19  marko_: does some could help me with problems an mysql server?
19:19  stew: Drake_: debian has many web browsers that work in a graphical environmen and many that work without
19:20  Drake_: stew, in my ipinion, thats just what I am looking for... is a very basic layout
19:20  dclarke: dear Debian .. how do I use dpkg to search for only those things that are installed which are related to oss? My alsa infrastructure does not work and I have no sound and I think the oss bits are mucking up the config
19:20  stew: marko_: just ask your real question
19:20  marko_: Thx stew.
19:20  marko_: My  mysql ist not running.
19:20  macrobat: Drake_: you conf your system and install the pkgs you want, balancing speed with the features you like
19:20  Drake_: so ok... if you had this "non graphical" layout.. how would you start up a browser??
19:21  Drake_: you would have to use commands right?
19:21  dclarke: Drake_: run elinks ?
19:21  marko_: qube:/var/run/mysqld# /etc/init.d/mysql restart
19:21  marko_: Stopping MySQL database server: mysqld failed!
19:21  marko_: Starting MySQL database server: mysqld already running.
19:21  marko_: qube:/var/run/mysqld#
19:21 <-- debhelper has kicked marko_ from #debian (use http://paste.debian.net or /msg dpkg paste)
19:21  Drake_: dclarke: you mean commmands?
19:21  macrobat: Drake_: links -g if you have kms
19:21  dclarke: Drake_: pure CLI .. yes
19:21  peterS: by CLI you don't really mean a command line interface.  it is full-screen, not a command line
19:21  dclarke: however, sorry for tossing in the non-sequiter .. I'm still fighting with alsa and no sound
19:22  macrobat: !tell marko_ about pastebin
19:22  Drake_: Intensity:  I see
19:22  dclarke: peterS: yes I know. however wget is just a CLI
19:22  Drake_: ouch though.. where do you guys learn all this,lol
19:22  marko_: qube:/var/run/mysqld# /etc/init.d/mysql restart
19:22  dclarke: Drake_: mostly by falling over and standing up .. repeat
19:22  peterS: dclarke: yes, wget is, but a lot of people say CLI when they mean curses (or equivalent - elinks actually reimplements something like curses internally)
19:23  dclarke: peterS: generally I mean a bourne shell or ksh and not much more
19:23  dclarke: however .. we digress

19:35  eshat: However, does anyone know about a debian even in germany, where I can get my gpg key signed ?
19:35  eshat: *event
19:36  Pinchiukas: Anyone can suggest the simplest mail relay daemon? So that I could 'sendmail' from localhost without relaying to some particular SMTP server.
19:36  stew: eshat: see http://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning/Offers#DE
19:36  KaffeeJunky123: eshat: heise.de does offer some service for it
19:37  pipeline: Pinchiukas: relaying to a particular smtp server IS the simplest method
19:37  pipeline: Pinchiukas: doing anything else means running a fullfledged mta, which is a massive pain in the ass
19:37  KaffeeJunky123: eshat: or are you refering to signing keys for packets?
19:37  pipeline: Pinchiukas: configure postfix w/ a smarthost provided by your isp
19:38  fasta: Do I need to enable anything to go from an Ubuntu machine remotely to a Debian machine and be able to see the remote desktop as if I am there locally?
19:38  Bushmills: KaffeeJunky123: heise does. visit their booth during computer faires.
19:38  fasta: What's considered the best software to do that?
19:38  dkr: fasta: yes
19:38  dkr: fasta: vnc
19:38  fasta: It's Gnome on both sides, if that matters.
19:39  Bushmills: oh, nm. i read "doesn't"
19:39  fasta: Gnome has some tools distributed with it, do those stink?
19:39  pipeline: fasta: install xephyr for a nested X server, the run the remote X11 session via ssh -X
19:39  dkr: fasta: x11vnc if you want to connect to ana lready running remote desktop.  the normal vnc you need to launch the desktop with vnc server separately
19:39  pipeline: fasta: e.g. ssh -X -C -v remote-host gnome-session
19:40  pipeline: fasta: you will need to set the DISPLAY variable to your local nested X
19:40  eshat: KaffeeJunky123: yes, gpg keys, for e-mail verification
19:40  fasta: pipeline: that sounds like a good plan.
19:40  pipeline: fasta: so, Xephyr :11; export DISPLAY=:11; ssh -X -C -v remote-host gnome-session
19:40  KaffeeJunky123: eshat: well heise does offer a serivce for that
19:40  Pinchiukas: pipeline: smarthost? As in a relay server?
19:40  pipeline: fasta: this is probably not the fastest method, but it's the simplest and most secure
19:40  Pinchiukas: ssmtp would do that just fine.
19:40  KaffeeJunky123: eshat: but I'm not using it, I'm verifying my keys irl
19:40  pipeline: Pinchiukas: yes
19:40  Pinchiukas: And it'd be simpler to configure.
19:41  Pinchiukas: Ok I guess postfix it is. :/

19:44  del_diablo: So... if I have package foo.z, which depends on package foo.y, I run the experimental version of foo.z and foo.y lacks a experimental version, how do I get foo.y installed?
19:44  Drake_: kristian-aalborg: sorry bout that
19:45  kristian-aalborg: np
19:45  Drake_: kristian-aalborg: is there a lightweight version of debian
19:45  kristian-aalborg: Drake_: I'm as much as a noob as youreself ;)
19:45  kristian-aalborg: in debian, at least
19:45  stew: del_diablo: aptitude install foo.y?
19:45  Drake_: kristian-aalborg: :)
19:45  del_diablo: Drake_: Debian without GNOME is light, all you need to do is to install lxde after the install is done, and it should work
19:45  stew: Drake_: there is only one version of debian.  what would a lightweight version mean?
19:46  Drake_: stew...just faster
19:46  kristian-aalborg: what del_diablo says sounds right
19:46  del_diablo: stew: foo.y needs stable version of foo.z :(
19:46  Drake_: and doesn't use too much ram
19:46  kristian-aalborg: what kind of specs do you have?
19:46  Drake_: I have an old IBM
19:46  Drake_: 1998
19:46  Pinchiukas: Oh so how do I disable ipv6?
19:46  Drake_: 300mb ram
19:46  kristian-aalborg: Drake_: lol
19:46  Drake_: kristian-aalborg: lol
19:46  kristian-aalborg: it's a year newer than the one I'm trying to get running
19:46  stew: Drake_: no, there aren't "faster" and "slower" versions of debian.  there is only one
19:46  kristian-aalborg: which model?
19:47  stew: del_diablo: wait, are you installing packages from experimental onto stable?  you shouldn't
19:47  Drake_: kristian-aalborg: thinkpad
19:47  kristian-aalborg: I have debian netinstall with fluxbox on this... it's okay
19:47  stew: del_diablo: you'll have to create your own version of foo.y,  perhaps uupdate can help
19:47  kristian-aalborg: Drake_: which model? Mine is a TP 770
19:47  Drake_: cwoaa
19:47  Drake_: lol
19:47  Drake_: then mine must be tp 50
19:48  del_diablo: stew: Pinning works quite nicely, thank you. Uupdate seems to be... frankly violating the debian way :(
19:48  Drake_: can someone send me the link to download the live cd of debian
19:48  del_diablo: Drake_: How is it connected to the internet?
19:48  Drake_: wireless

19:49  del_diablo: Drake_: http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/dists/lenny/main/installer-i386/current/images/
19:49  stew: del_diablo: you really should not be using pinning to mix experimental and stable
19:49  del_diablo: Remember to not install desktop envriroment
19:49  Pinchiukas: Adding "alias ipv6 off" to /etc/modprobe.d/aliases didn't disable ipv6.
19:49  stew: del_diablo: how does uupdate violate the debian way?
19:50  Drake_: del_diablo: where is the ISO
19:51  stew: Drake_: note that he's pointing you to the installer, not the live version
19:51  Drake_: ohh stew
19:51  del_diablo: stew: Theoretically, yes, i agree. But on the other hand there is certain software I want up to date, such as the radeon stack whever it gets updated. The only way of achiving that is pinning. I might be using the last one a bit deliberatly wrong, but I dislike compiling down something that could be done via normal repos.
19:51  Drake_: it doesn't have a live version right
19:51  stew: Drake_: yes, http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/release/current-live/
19:51  Drake_: ahh there we go
19:52  Drake_: thanks
19:52  stew: del_diablo: ok, but as you've already said, this cannot be done via normal repos
19:52  Drake_: whats kde desktop
19:53  stew: del_diablo: if you want something newer that is not on stable, you should be using a backport, not installing binaries from another release or from experimental
19:53  del_diablo: stew: Theoretically there is no broken packages besides the fact that some dev set up insane version requirements.... So... well... I guess I like the way my current system works besides that minor issue.
19:53  stew: del_diablo: what are the insane version requirements?
19:54  Drake_: wow debian has so many options
19:54  Drake_: the standard version is without the gnome and stufff right
19:54  Drake_: the command based one....correct
19:55  stew: Drake_: as I've told you many times already, there is only one version
19:55  stew: Drake_: you can chose to add gnome or not
19:55  Drake_: stew... thats not what im asking
19:55  Pinchiukas: How do I disable ipv6?
19:55  Pinchiukas: Adding "alias ipv6 off" to /etc/modprobe.d/aliases didn't disable ipv6.
19:55  Drake_: there are several downloads here
19:55  thewanderer1: !disable ipv6
19:55  dpkg: [noipv6] To disable use of <IPv6> on Lenny: echo install ipv6 /bin/true >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf (and reboot for this change to take effect).  From Squeeze onwards, IPv6 is built into the kernel, add the kernel command line option ipv6.disable=1 to your bootloader.
19:55  Drake_: the standard is the one without the gnome??
19:55  del_diablo: stew: "freeglut3-dev:  Depends: libgl1-mesa-dev but will not be installed or libgl-dev. Depends: libglu1-mesa-dev but will not be installed or libglu-dev" All packages are ironically installed, except that the mesa stack is running on experimental

19:56  Drake_: stew.. oh I see
19:57  Drake_: so what is standard live cd
19:57  Drake_: or kde
19:57  Drake_: and then it has gnome
19:57  stew: Drake_: oh, i forgot you were looking at livecds
19:57  del_diablo: standard, since you should not run either DE when on such a weak computer
19:57  Drake_: stew :)
19:57  Pinchiukas: Must I tell my bootloader about ipv6? No other way?
19:58  del_diablo: Pinchiukas: Yes, running grub2 btw?
19:58  stew: del_diablo: why is a dependency on libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev insane?
19:58  del_diablo: stew: No, the dep is not insane. What is insane is that is that they are already installed.
19:58  Pinchiukas: del_diablo: yes.
19:59  wildc4rd: evenin all
19:59  Pinchiukas: del_diablo: can't I just config that in sysctl.conf or something?
19:59  stew: del_diablo: show me the output of "apt-cache policy freeglut3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libgl-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglu-dev"

20:01  Drake_: or can they be rigged
20:01  del_diablo: Hmm, now that you mention it stew, it seems odd....
20:01  stew: del_diablo: so no, none of them are installed
20:01  stew: Drake_: why would you want to use a torrent at all?
20:01  Drake_: stew, its faster
20:01  stew: Drake_: no it isn't
20:01  del_diablo: Drake_: Torrents is safer anyhow
20:01  stew: Drake_: its slower
20:02  Drake_: stew: the download speed from the site is so slow
20:02  Drake_: its at 9%
20:02  Drake_: still
20:02  stew: Drake_: the md5sum of the images are published, you should be checking them no matter how you download them
20:02  Pinchiukas: Torrents should be safe I think.
20:02  stew: Drake_: choose a closer mirror: http://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/
20:03  stew: it should be easy to find a mirror that can go faster than your internet connection
20:03  del_diablo: stew: Still.... libgl-dev and some of the packages does not exist.... is that odd?
20:03  stew: del_diablo: no, they are virtual
20:03  Drake_: thanks stew
20:03  stew: del_diablo: aptitude search '~Plibgl-dev'
20:05  stew: del_diablo: its a way of saying "i can run with any implementation of gl-dev" libgl1-mesa-dev is specified as the default implementation
20:07  del_diablo: stew: Thanks for the help, that solved the problem

20:09  Drake_: are there nice and ugly themes for debian (im being serious)
20:09  Drake_: basic themes
20:09  Drake_: like windows 3.1
20:09  Drake_: or slackware
20:09  del_diablo: Drake_: XFCE-dark or what its called, quite goodlooking
20:09  del_diablo: Default lxde theme should be ugly as heck
20:10  Drake_: del_diablo: lol
20:10  Drake_: sweet
20:10  Drake_: im downloading the xfce live version
20:11  del_diablo: Drake_: Why don't you download standard, install without desktop, and run "apt-get install lxde" later on? :(
20:12  Drake_: del_diablo: ya??... you think I should
20:13  del_diablo: Drake_: I am evil! Don't listen to me xD Well, I guess i am respresenting the group that has done archlinux, but never liked the ridicule fickeling. The advantage of doing so is that the work difference from normal desktop install is more or less null, along with the benefit of a ligther desktop
20:14  Drake_: del_diablo: thats exactly what I want
20:14  Drake_: exactly!!
20:14  Drake_: I dont want fanciness
20:14  Drake_: I just want basic things and security
20:14  Drake_: with speed
20:16  stew: blink: edit /etc/sysctl.conf and run "sysctl -p"
20:16  Drake_: del_diablo: So it should be the 5.0 standard version?
20:17  del_diablo: Drake_: I think so, yes.
20:17  blink: I meant "is it required for that to be enabled", I know how
20:17  stew: blink: no
20:18  stew: Drake_: no, you want the lxde version
20:19  stew: well, i don't know what the standard one is
20:19  Drake_: lol XO
20:19  del_diablo: Standard = GNOME, and it always is. No exceptions.
20:19  Drake_: ok..which one from here
20:19  Drake_: http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.7-live/i386/iso-cd/
20:19  stew: del_diablo: what is the difference between the standard one and the gnome version then?
20:20  del_diablo: stew: I don't think it is anything
20:20  stew: Drake_: ahh, the standard one will be without a graphical environment
20:21  Drake_: stew thats perfect
20:21  stew: del_diablo: the gnome version is > 4 times larger than the standard version
20:21  stew: Drake_: and you are NOT intending to install debian?  just use it from a cd?
20:21  Drake_: stew I just want to try it
20:21  Drake_: I have ubuntu...its nice but on the slower side
20:21  Drake_: and thats on a p4 3.2
20:22  stew: Drake_: what are you planning to do with it after booting it?
20:22  stew: Drake_: it won't have much to do.  it won't have, for instance, a web browser
20:22  del_diablo: stew: Ok, then the difference is the amount of bundled software........ But nevermind that, the core DE shipped is the same <3
20:22  stew: del_diablo: no, its not
20:22  stew: del_diablo: its just a base system
20:23  Drake_: stew: its just thebase system
20:23  Drake_: Drake_: which version would be ideal to test out
20:23  Drake_: lol...
20:23  stew: Drake_: i'd recommend the lxde version
20:23  Drake_: ok
20:24  Drake_: stew...and thats not the graphical version
20:24  stew: Drake_: that IS a graphical version
20:24  Drake_: which is good
20:24  Drake_: ok stew
20:24  stew: Drake_: if you don't want a graphical version, then sure, try the standard version
20:25  stew: i have a feeling its going to be much too basic
20:25  Drake_: debian-live-507-i386-lxde-desktop.iso
20:25  Drake_: this one?
20:25  stew: Drake_: what are you hoping to be able to do with it?
20:26  Drake_: I just want to broswe the internet really
20:26  Drake_: maybe listen to some youtube
20:26  stew: Drake_: then yes, that one
20:26  blink: ty stew

20:27  amee2k: how do i figure out which package contains "gimp-2.0" and "gimpui-2.0" packages for pkgconfig?
20:27  stew: i have no idea if swfdec in lenny is going to be able to view youtube,  I'm not hopeful
20:27  amee2k: i need them to build the panotools gump plugin
20:27  amee2k: installing libgimp2.0-dev didn't do the trick
20:28  amee2k: any hints?
20:29  stew: libgimp2.0-dev: /usr/lib/pkgconfig/gimp-2.0.pc
20:30  stew: amee2k: "apt-file search pkgconfig | grep gimp" is what I'd suggest using to figure this out
20:30  iugrina: hi all. Does anyone know how easy it is to set tuxonice + encrypted lvm (swap + root) ? Does anyone have a simillar setup?
20:32  amee2k: stew: ooh. for some reason it didn't install libgimp2.0-dev when i wanted it to
20:32  amee2k: it configures now. lemme try make it
20:32  Drake_: ( is temporarily away)
20:32  rioch: So, I downloaded the driver for my network card. I run make clean modules, and low and behold debian doesn't have make...
20:33  stew: !b-e rioch
20:33  dpkg: rioch: Sounds like you need to aptitude install build-essential.
20:33  rioch: stew: I don't have network access on that machine.
20:33  amee2k: stew: mmmh, you kinda could have spelled that out too :P
20:34  stew: rioch: use "apt-get --print-uris install build-essential" to figure out what urls you need to fetch from another machine then
20:34  rioch: stew: that's a tedious job that I shouldn't have to do.
20:34  stew: ok
20:35  amee2k: well, its annoying
20:35  amee2k: but why do you think you shouldn't have to do it?
20:35  stew: rioch: don't expect debian to change in these regards, probably, ever
20:35  rioch: stew: I don't want them too.
20:35  amee2k: you'd have to download drives without network access on other operating systems too
20:36  stew: rioch: more wasteful and less tedious might be to download the cd that has build-essential and install build-essential from there
20:37  amee2k: download drivers* even
20:37  rioch: I also need the kernel source tree
20:37  stew: rioch: probably not, you probably only need the headers
20:37  rioch: annoyingly, in lenny it works out of the box. The driver was removed from the kernel
20:37  stew: rioch: do you really not have a driver?  are you sure you aren't just missing firmware?
20:38  rioch: stew: yes, firmware, sorry my mistake
20:38  stew: rioch: then you don't need to build anything
20:38  amee2k: aren't there nic-extra packages with modules that have recently been removed?
20:38  stew: rioch: probably the reason it was removed was that it was impossible to build
20:38  amee2k: or are these only for the install system
20:38  rioch: I downloaded firmware-linux, and the free/non-free variants
20:38  rioch: rebooted and didn't do anything; google is less than helpful
20:39  stew: rioch: which driver are you using?
20:39  stew: rioch: or which card do you have?
20:39  rioch: realtek rtl8111/8168b
20:40  stew: judd: pciname 8168b
20:40  judd: '8168b' matched: [10ec:8168] 'RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller' from 'Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.'
20:40  stew: judd: pciid 10ec:8168
20:40  judd: [10ec:8168] is 'RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller' from 'Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.' with kernel module 'r8169' in lenny. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=10ec:8168

20:43  stew: rioch: so what happens now if you "modprobe -r r8169; modprobe r8169" then check dmesg?
20:43  diago: like webserver path/to/files
20:44  diago: that would be great if someone can program that real quick
20:44  diago: thanks in advance

20:44  acemi: 8000 is the port
20:45  stew: rioch: can you put it in a pastebin?
20:45  diago: YEAH! that sounds promising
20:45  rioch: stew: yeah, which pastebin should I use?

20:46  kristian-aalborg: can someone help me kickstart wireless?
20:46  diago: ZOMG that's great acemi!!!
20:46  rioch: stew: there are 8 lines in total....but I'd have to type it because I'm on a different pc
20:46  rioch: stew: is there anything ur looking for?
20:47  streuner_: kristian-aalborg: Are you using Debian by any chance? :-)
20:47  stew: rioch: does the firmwaere file its looking for exist in /lib/firmware?
20:47  kristian-aalborg: yes ;)
20:47  kristian-aalborg: I feel like I've tried everything at this moment
20:47  kristian-aalborg: got debian + fluxbox on the machine
20:47  kristian-aalborg: this is the machine:
20:47  streuner_: but.., wireless shouldnt be that hard....
20:48  kristian-aalborg: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:770
20:48  acemi: rioch: did you check /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
20:48  stew: for a firmware loading problem?
20:49  streuner_: Thinkpads are usually well supported...
20:49  Hatter[1]: how do i return to my X desktop after pressing ctrl-alt-F2 ?
20:49  kristian-aalborg: http://www.canit.se/~oli/wl/
20:49  kristian-aalborg: this is the card
20:49  stew: Hatter[1]: alt-f7
20:49  Hatter[1]: stew, thx
20:49  rioch: stew: nope, the firmware file it's looking for is not there
20:49  kristian-aalborg: I have a router about 1,5 meters from the laptop, but it sees nothing on scan
20:49  rioch: acemi: what is that for?
20:49  kristian-aalborg: Hatter[1]: startx?
20:50  stew: rioch: did you actually install the firmware-linux-nonfree pacakge?
20:50  rioch: stew: yes, with dpkg -i
20:50  kristian-aalborg: streuner_: tried on several distros anything I could think of... no succes
20:50  stew: rioch: what is the name of the file it is looking for?
20:50  Hatter[1]: kristian-alborg, alt-F7 did it, i think startx would begin a new X session would it ?
20:50  makubi: Hatter[1]: ctrl-alt-f7
20:50  Pyista42: is it good to run your own dns server or should i let the datacenter handle that?
20:50  makubi: Hatter[1]: wah, sorry
20:50  kristian-aalborg: Hatter[1]: ah, that kind of thing
20:51  stew: kristian-aalborg: the model number of the card is not actually helpful here, we'd need to know the chipset it has or the deviceid
20:51  rioch: rtl8168d-1.fw
20:51  rioch: kristian-aalborg: is your router hiding the ssid?
20:51  acemi: rioch: I didn't catch the beginning of the problem, I think that there is an ethernet which is not working now
20:51  streuner_: kristian-aalborg: sounds to me like a misconfiguration of the client, a router shouldnt have a problem to connect at alll
20:51  stew: ahh
20:51  rioch: acemi: yes. it seems the firmware it needs isn't installed.
20:51  stew: !dbugs 561309

20:52  kristian-aalborg: deviceid: 1186:3300
20:52  kristian-aalborg: I just set my network to no security... still no luck
20:52  kristian-aalborg: streuner_: by client you mean the laptop
20:52  kristian-aalborg: ?
20:52  streuner_: sure
20:52  kristian-aalborg: k
20:52  stew: rioch: the solution is "you don't actually need the firmware, it works fine without it"
20:53  rioch: stew: really? but ifconfig doesn't list the device.
20:53  makubi: kristian-aalborg: your device is recognized by the sys?
20:53  streuner_: kristian-aalborg: look into  /msg dpkg interfaces
20:54  diago: kristian-aalborg: does ifconfig show a device?
20:54  stew: rioch: read the bug
20:54  kristian-aalborg: the card seems to be found by the system like it should - blinkenlights when I scan etc
20:55  rioch: stew: that line above by dpkg? I don't understand it.
20:55  kristian-aalborg: streuner_: how do I do that?
20:55  kristian-aalborg: diago: ifconfig seems fine
20:55  stew: rioch: #561309 is the bug number in the bts
20:56  makubi: kristian-aalborg: like rioch mentioned, did you enabled ssid-broadcast on the ap?
20:56  rioch: stew: thanks, let me read it.
20:57  kristian-aalborg: makubi: the router?
20:57  kristian-aalborg: I can see it from other laptops
20:57  makubi: kristian-aalborg: ok
20:57  kristian-aalborg: (the network, I mean)
20:58  makubi: kristian-aalborg: do you see it, if you scan for networks on the console?
20:59  kristian-aalborg: makubi: no
20:59  makubi: kristian-aalborg: you did it as root?
21:00  kristian-aalborg: as root or normal user.. nothing
21:00  kristian-aalborg: I live on a block with usually 10 visible networks or so
21:00  makubi: kristian-aalborg: try enabling it (ifconfig DEVICE up)
21:01  kristian-aalborg: same
21:01  kristian-aalborg: I'm still root, is that okay?
21:01  makubi: should be fine
21:01  makubi: so if you start it and scan again, no luck?
21:01  makubi: check out dmesg too
21:02  kristian-aalborg: no luck with "down" and "scan" again
21:03  kristian-aalborg: it should be mentioned that my install is no longer vanilla - I got some things with "pcmcia" or "wireless" in their name
21:03  makubi: kristian-aalborg: "down" wouldn't do it

21:05  fasta: pipeline: I don't really get a fullscreen nested x server, but otherwise it works.
21:05  kristian-aalborg: makubi: I had wireless before on this box, with an usb dongle
21:05  kristian-aalborg: the wired pcmcia card is working fine also
21:05  makubi: kristian-aalborg: well, maybe the built-in wireless-access-device is disabled
21:05  kristian-aalborg: makubi: this is a pcmcia card
21:05  zwamkat: gp2k: Is it a Peer-Directed Projects Center? http://freenode.net/pdpc.shtml

21:06  kristian-aalborg: and no "wifi on/off" button
21:06  kristian-aalborg: makubi: the same
21:06  rioch: stew: I've read the bug report, and it should just work as you said, but I never get an eth0 entry in ifconfig
21:06  makubi: kristian-aalborg: I wonder if you tried with some distributions but it won't work on any of them

21:07  fasta: Using Xephyr, how can I get a full screen desktop (or windowed but much larger)?
21:08  makubi: kristian-aalborg: You should try ubuntu live (don't hit me)
21:08  acemi: rioch: did you change your ethernet adaptor after installing debian?
21:08  kristian-aalborg: the annoying thing is, that if you google for instance "pcmcia thinkpad 770 wifi error linux" you will get some results, but that does not neccesarily mean that they apply to you :/
21:08  rioch: acemi: no
21:08  kristian-aalborg: makubi: this box is too old for ubuntu
21:08  makubi: kristian-aalborg: are you sure?
21:08  kristian-aalborg: yes :)
21:09  makubi: what do you mean by "too old"?
21:09  kristian-aalborg: also, the cdrom is a bit faulty

21:11  envoked: I went through all the standard steps but for some reason, now when I try to boot my VPS I get a Error: 15 File not found error
21:11  rioch: Is it possible to download the firmware file from somewhere?
21:11  envoked: and after upgrading, it seems like my grub wasn't upgraded because i still only see an entry for lenny and none for squeeze
21:12  fasta: Why is it 30 times slower to connect to start gnome-session remotely in a nested X server?
21:13  kristian-aalborg: stew: yes, a bit
21:14  stew: kristian-aalborg: linux sees your interface?  but you just can't connect to access points?
21:14  kristian-aalborg: yes, that sounds like it
21:15  kristian-aalborg: it does not "see" anything
21:15  Hatter[1]: i have a lot of xterms open on my X desktop with programs running in them and they are all sized up nicely, what can i do return the desktop as it is on re boot ? the gnome-session save would only save the xterms i think not the programs running inside ?
21:15  stew: kristian-aalborg: can you pastebin the output of "iwconfig"?
21:16  stew: kristian-aalborg: and i guess the output of "iwlist scan"
21:18  kristian-aalborg: stew: sure

21:25  kristian-aalborg: http://pastebin.com/HA577A3c
21:25  stew: yes, but raid is not a backup
21:25  kristian-aalborg: here's dmesg
21:25  dkr: khaije|amalt: sounds like drbd
21:26  Pinchiukas: http://pastebin.com/dLYHmpL0 - why can't it connect? The file is there: srwxrwxr-x 1 dkim-filter dkim-filter 0 Dec  2 21:39 /var/run/dkim-filter/dkim-filter.sock
21:26  dkr: !tell khaije|amalt about drbd
21:26  stew: kristian-aalborg: you've tried "ifconfig wlan0 up" first, right?
21:26  defn: okay i figured out part of my problem, but i really need some help on this one: https://gist.github.com/725995  I cannot get tmux to build.  See the Error in the gist.
21:26  khaije|amalt: stew: it would be an opputunistic sync, no?
21:26  AlexC_: morning
21:26  stew: khaije|amalt: oppurtunistic?  not if you mean by that what I think you mean
21:27  AlexC_: with the recent announcement for install/upgrade tests of Squeeze, is there a rough estimate for release date now?
21:27  Drake_: does debian have decent wireless compatibility
21:27  khaije|amalt: stew: i just mean it will sync when possible, but not bother much when it can't
21:27  khaije|amalt: since i can set the local disk to the raid 1 primary
21:27  kristian-aalborg: stew: yes, and then iwlist wlan0 scan
21:27  stew: khaije|amalt: then "no"
21:27  kristian-aalborg: gives no results
21:28  khaije|amalt: dkr: i'm not sure how this is different/better...
21:28  kristian-aalborg: here's my /var/log/boot: http://pastebin.com/HA577A3c
21:28  dkr: khaije|amalt: just giving you another very similar option.
21:28  stew: khaije|amalt: when the remote disk becomes unavailable, its not going to magically resync when it becomes available again, you'll have to manually re-add it.  then its not going to just copy the stuff that has changed to the remote disk, its going to again copy EVERYTHING
21:29  dkr: there are always trade-offs.  and yeah, i was just abotu to say that, I think failure to write might cause ther aid to go into degraded mode
21:29  kristian-aalborg: I got NetworkManager btw
21:29  dkr: drbd might handle network connectivity loss better
21:29  stew: khaije|amalt: and its not a backup in the sense that when you go "rm importantthing" and say "OOPS I NEEDED THAT" you can't say "i'll just grab it from my backup"  because it was instantly also deleted from your "backup"
21:29  rioch: stew: any idea what I can do? I'm really stuck on this.
21:29  khaije|amalt: stew: oh ya, i get that
21:30  stew: rioch: not if there wasn't a usable workaround in the bts
21:30  khaije|amalt: stew: i was thinking about this for 1. the portability of vm's and 2. the increasesd ease of backing up centralized data
21:32  khaije|amalt: stew: i thought it was part of the raid protocol that differing members were merged, you're saying their only overwritten?
21:32  kristian-aalborg: stew: any words of wisdom? ;)
21:32  khaije|amalt: when i say merged i mean on a this file is newer so it overwrites that file basis
21:32  stew: kristian-aalborg: i'd also try unloading and reloading the kernel module
21:32  kristian-aalborg: rtl8180?
21:32  stew: kristian-aalborg: RAID doesn't know what a file is.  its bit by bit on the disk
21:33  stew: khaije|amalt: ^^^ that was meant for you, sorry
21:33  stew: khaije|amalt: i don't know what you mean by "raid protocol"
21:33  khaije|amalt: i gathered. it's something that i've always wanted to try but maybe i'll think it through more
21:34  makubi: kristian-aalborg: what wlan-interface do you use? which hardware?
21:34  kristian-aalborg: you mean the computer?
21:35  kristian-aalborg: pcmcia
21:35  stew: he means which chipset
21:35  makubi: kristian-aalborg: no, do a 'lspci | grep -i net'
21:35  makubi: stew: thanks ;-)
21:35  stew: makubi: (its not pci)
21:36  makubi: stew: so lspcmcia does it?
21:36  stew: makubi: its this:http://wiki.debian.org/rtl818x

21:36  stew: < kristian-aalborg> deviceid: 1186:3300
21:37  makubi: right
21:37  makubi: kristian-aalborg: so you should reload the module you loaded before
21:38  kristian-aalborg: rtl8180
21:38  kristian-aalborg: modprobe rtl8180?

21:38  stew: then check "dmesg | tail" again
21:39  kristian-aalborg: still nothing
21:39  stew: and then you'd have to "ifconfig wlan0 up" again before you'd expect anything to work

21:57  freeone3000: That'll work, I suppose, I just wanted to avoid compiling gcc because it takes forever. Thanks.

21:59  delby: hi. i want upgrade package foo that was installed from squeeze to squeeze-snapshot. i added the necessary lines to sources.list. what command do i give?
21:59  freeone3000: 'apt-get install foo' will update it.

21:59  khem_: I am using the guided partitioner in Debians installer, its been black screen for about 15 minutes. is it normal that it takes that long time for just 400gb?
21:59  iluminator101: hey guys it stalls at this point, thanks in advance. http://pastebin.com/fB0UzDm0
22:00  freeone3000: stew: Thanks. I'll see if it installs without pulling in huge amounts of depends.
22:00  dondelelcaro: khem_: no, that's not normal
22:00  delby: but i still have the original squeeze repo line. will it know to do so from snapshots?
22:00  freeone3000: stew: Ah. Source deps. Was going with vanilla gcc, thanks anyway.
