09:50  iaj: what's an easy way to disable pc speaker :S?
09:53  mariusv: poisonbit: i work with serverloft and they are super ok
09:54  scoobertron: iaj: if it crops up in alsameter, you can just mute it - this is what I do.
09:55  b3hnam: How can I connect to a L2TP vpn in debian (gnome) ?
09:55  Kamping_Kaiser: iaj: remove the pc speaker module
09:59  iaj: Kamping_Kaiser: no easier way.. that's working out of the box?
09:59  iaj: or .. how would I remove the module.. modprobe -X ..?
10:00  Kamping_Kaiser: iaj: easier way? :| `rmmod pcspkr` is about as easy as it gets
10:00  iaj: Kamping_Kaiser: thanks! oops thought you ment recompile the kernel
10:00  Kamping_Kaiser: anyway gl, bbl
10:07  CutMeOwnThroat: recompile the kernel!
10:07  CutMeOwnThroat: you're mad, got mad pills, do you?
10:08  CutMeOwnThroat: !tell iaj -about blacklist

10:19  kevin8x: can someboey tell me why?
10:19  iaj: CutMeOwnThroat: ohhh I should refer to your nickname here :) Thanks... that's a much more easier solution heh :)
10:20  kevin8x: my english is very pool!can you help me?
10:22  CutMeOwnThroat: b3hnam, http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=network-manager-gnome
10:24  bohne: hi, i need help investigating memory problems: http://pastebin.com/KWdSArnj
10:25  CutMeOwnThroat: b3hnam, also look at /usr/share/doc/network-manager-gnome/README.Debian and the network-manager docu referred therein... if none of that provides a clue, I would file a bug-report on it...
10:25  CutMeOwnThroat: there's two bugs on vpn together with it...
10:29  iaj: how can I switch the keyboard layout?
10:30  CutMeOwnThroat: using about 10 different methods
10:32  CutMeOwnThroat: like... in gnome there's a preferences/keyboard section
10:32  CutMeOwnThroat: or...
10:35  iaj: CutMeOwnThroat: this one doesn't have X .. only on ttys
10:45  CutMeOwnThroat: !keymap
10:45  dpkg: Lenny users: To change your console keymap, run "dpkg-reconfigure console-data".  To change your X keymap, read "man xmodmap", ask me about <drxx>, use kcontrol, gnome-control-center or similar.  For setting up X keymaps, also check out xkeycaps, xev and ask me about <multimedia keys>.  In console you can also use "loadkeys" for once-only/temporary adjustments.  Squeeze users: "dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" for both console and X.
10:45  CutMeOwnThroat: b3.... oh, gorn
10:46  nsadmin: how does the console keymap interact with the x keymap?
10:46  Number5_: Hello guys, my debian lenny forces a disk check every 30 times of rebooting. I want to disable it, does anyone know how?
10:46  CutMeOwnThroat: nsadmin, afaik: not
10:47  CutMeOwnThroat: ext2?
10:47  nsadmin: Number5_: try man hdparm (BUT this is NOT recommended. also, you need to create a full backup plan and strategy)
10:47  nsadmin: having said that... have fun.
10:48  Number5_: nsadmin: no, I don't want to take the risk.
10:48  CutMeOwnThroat: Number5_, ext2?
10:48  Number5_: I assume ext3 as I'm using Lenny
10:48  nsadmin: then, make sure you have a backup plan and strategy
10:48  CutMeOwnThroat: !assume
10:48  dpkg: Don't assume, just KNOW.
10:49  CutMeOwnThroat: what happened to the thingy where you make an ass out of u and me when you assume?
10:49  nsadmin: Number5_... what is the actual problem you're directly experiencing?
10:50  Number5_: I'm pretty sure it's ext3, but I'm carefull, that's why I assume. Before I really do it, I'll check to be sure.
10:50  CutMeOwnThroat: anyway: look up what filesystem it is, it's like going to the doctor and saying "I have a vague pain somewhere, but I can't tell you where, but it's really intense sometimes"
10:50  nsadmin: so, as far as you know there's no way to be absolutely sure?
10:50  nsadmin: CutMeOwnThroat, "... but not right now"
10:51  CutMeOwnThroat: nsadmin, right!
10:51  nsadmin: that just goes to show ya, it's always something...
10:52  Number5_: Guys, I think it's not important what filesystem I have, the fact is at bootup, after 30 times, it triggers a filesystem check, which takes some time before it finish. After that 3verything is normal. But my box will be used as a blackbox, with no monitor, keyboard or mouse. Only a bluetooth connection with a pda.
10:53  nsadmin: so you're now saying you're not willing to provide information?
10:53  CutMeOwnThroat: wouldn't ask if it wasn't important
10:53  Kamping_Kaiser: you can change the frequency with tune2fs
10:53  CutMeOwnThroat: but I'll give you an answer fitting to the question: draw a magic rune on your computer (can't tell you which) and chant a mystic chant (can't tell you the words) while dancing around it three times and it'll go away
10:54  CutMeOwnThroat: gotta do it PROPERLY, though
10:54  Number5_: nsadmin: ??? what's wrong with you? Tom satisfy you, it has an ext3 FS, I know since I installed a fresh Lenny, which is by default an ext3
10:54  nsadmin: you have to be facing east... or up...
10:54  CutMeOwnThroat: Number5_, ext3 should NEVER get checked, as it's got a journal
10:54  nsadmin: Number5_: you're the one asking for our help
10:54  Number5_: hahahahaha
10:55  Number5_: you guys are funny really.
10:55  nsadmin: recognize the amount of money you're paying for service
10:55  CutMeOwnThroat: Number5_, would different if it's mounted as ext2, which would be WRONG
10:55  Dewi: Number5_: check frequency is totally FS dependent
10:55 * Kamping_Kaiser sighs and shakes head
10:55  Dewi: Number5_: I don't know why you'd think it wouldn't be?
10:56  Number5_: anyway, I'll check further and come back later when resolved it, so you know what I'm talking about.
10:56  nsadmin: Number5_: so is it that you want to see others as being funny or is it that you authentically want help
10:56  Kamping_Kaiser: Number5_: my answer from efore is /still/ correct.
10:56  Number5_: nsadmin: no, it's funny how you guys come with responses :)
10:56  nsadmin: right now you're matching a lot of patterns which have been used by trolls in the past
10:57  Number5_: Kamping_Kaiser: aaah I missed that.
10:57  Number5_: Kamping_Kaiser: I think that's the solution. I'll check it out.
10:57  CutMeOwnThroat: Kamping_Kaiser, it's what I thought, too - but he could mount ext3 as ext2, which would probably give the same behavior and then correct action would not be to just change that, but mount as ext3 ...
10:57  Dewi: Number5_: you don't want to take risks, but you want people to play a guessing game with your system, and it's funny that we think that's unusual... hmmmm
10:57  nsadmin: Number5_: IF YOU WANT FREE HELP, BE COOPERATIVE.
10:57  CutMeOwnThroat: Kamping_Kaiser, bit difficult if someone refuses to answer basic questions
10:58  Kamping_Kaiser: Number5_: gl
10:58  Kamping_Kaiser: CutMeOwnThroat: yeah, lifes full of small challenges though (cough)
10:58  Kamping_Kaiser: themill: gday :0
10:58  CutMeOwnThroat: rite
10:58  nsadmin: otherwise, there are many here who are talented and can help you, at their normal rate (which is probably minimum $150/hour)
10:58  Number5_: Dewi, nsadmin, please, don't blow things up. Maybe I wasn't clear about what I want to ask. This doesn't mean we have to be angry at each other. Be happy, not irritated.
10:59  themill: !next
10:59  dpkg: Another happy customer leaves the building.
10:59  nsadmin: Number5_: you were the one who refused to supply information
10:59  nsadmin: don't put this on me
10:59  Number5_: And I really appreciate your help, that is one thing you should know about me. I'm nothing without your help.
11:00  nsadmin: I'll differ with that as well; you're -not- nothing in any case.
11:00  CutMeOwnThroat: anyway... I think we provided as many pointers as possible with the current information, so perhaps it's time to drop it now...
11:00  Dewi: Number5_: sure. Anyway you can also use an fs_passno of 0 in your /etc/fstab. I've done so on some larger, less critical storage areas, but I wouldn't do it on root
11:01  nsadmin: Number5_: so, do you know how you can find out the facts?
11:01  Number5_: Ok, thnx to you all. I'll try tune2fs like Kamping_Kaiser suggested me
11:01  CutMeOwnThroat: Number5_, check on stuff first!
11:01  CutMeOwnThroat: Number5_, look in /etc/fstab what you''re mounting it as
11:01  Number5_: nsadmin: we will see... I'll let you when I'm back.
11:02  nsadmin: he's still unusually unwilling... but, he wants to do it himself I guess
11:02  nsadmin: that's perfectly ok, except at any point of him asking a question
11:04  nsadmin: I don't actually know why he's unwilling... either there's not a separate reason (intrinsically unwilling) or there is a reason, like the computer is in the other room or somethign
11:13  Number5_: Ok here's the deal. When my Lenny boots up, it checks how may times it has mounted to my HDD (sda1). If it reaches 31 times, it forces a fscheck. Now, since fschck is doing an important job and it's recommended, I modified the max mount times befor it performs a fschk to 70 times. Now my problem solved. Thank you everybody.
11:13  rethus: i have a debian server. if i have a look on /var/log/messages/ i didn't see many logs... thats strange for me... normaly - on other server - there are thousend of looks like denied access to ssh and other stuff.
11:13  Kamping_Kaiser: Number5_: wd :)
11:14  Number5_: did the follwoing: tune2fs -c 70 /dev/sda1
11:14  rethus: how can i increment verbosity of the logs?
11:14  Number5_: Kamping_Kaiser: thank you :)
11:14  Kamping_Kaiser: :)
11:14  Pippo1: sale a tutti :)
11:14  Pippo1: *salve
11:14  Kamping_Kaiser: rethus: what are you looking for? auth stuff is in /var/log/auth
11:15  rethus: Kamping_Kaiser: k, there i have some logs, but no access-denied...
11:15  rethus: thats strange, cause ssh run on default-port
11:15  internat: Gday All, im corious to know if anyone has any recommendations for a gfx card (nvidia) that works well under linux, capable of playing 1080p media, and if possible supports audio over hdmi..
11:15  Kamping_Kaiser: rethus: what do you want to find out?
11:16  rethus: i have other server, and there are many logs for ssh - if it runs on a default-port
11:16  Kamping_Kaiser: rethus: does that box have proper firewalls? no hostname? behind another firewall? just because its a server doesn't mean its going to have logs full of crap.
11:16  Number5_: rethus: Kamping_Kaiser already told you that you have to look at /var/log/auth.
11:17  rethus: its strange for me, that there are no log of unauthorized access.
11:17  Number5_: Cause you configure to direct some types of error to a particular file or filter out some loggings etc...
11:17  tecneeq: hi gents. dude says tasksel tasks are largely deprecated in favor of meta-packages, did anyone hear something like that before?
11:17  Kamping_Kaiser: rethus: auth and syslog are where you'll find that detail
11:17  Kamping_Kaiser: tecneeq: bollocks
11:17  rethus: in auth.log i have many logs like this:
11:17  rethus: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)
11:17  rethus: pam_unix(cron:session): session closed for user root
11:18  Kamping_Kaiser: internat: fraid not
11:18  nsadmin: Number5_, take a look at your file /etc/fstab
11:18  nsadmin: does it make sense to you?
11:18  rethus: i use ssl-key-authentication... are this unautorized login attempts?
11:19 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 823]
11:25  nsadmin: tecneeq: they are metapackages
11:25  nsadmin: but not all metapackages are task packages
11:27  iceroot: at what part/file of the debian-cd/installation i can say what modules needs to be loaded for the installation? atm i have to use "modprobe cdrom; modprobe usb-storage" is there a file i can name that modules and rebuild a cd?
11:29  tecneeq: nsadmin: hmm, are you sure? the task ,,gnome-desktop'' doesn't seem to have a meta-package with that name.
11:29  nsadmin: I think that would be called gnome
11:30  tecneeq: nsadmin: the problem i face is that i get 55 packages when i type this: tasksel -t --task-packages gnome-desktop --task-packages german-desktop --task-packages desktop
11:31  Kamping_Kaiser: what is the problem?
11:32  tecneeq: nsadmin: i use puppet to ensure packags are installed, but puppet doesn't understand tasks yet. so i have to build the list of packages with the mentioned command
11:32  tecneeq: then puppet calls 55 times aptitutde or apt-get
11:32  Kamping_Kaiser: tecneeq: puppet can run arbitrary commands though, just run what you just pasted here
11:32  Kamping_Kaiser: it better anyway o.0
11:33  tecneeq: right, exec is what i use right now. but i would like to see it as a package provider
11:33  Kamping_Kaiser: surely thats puppets problem?
11:34  tecneeq: it is, that's why i asked if tasks are deprecated
11:34  Kamping_Kaiser: no, is the short answer
11:34  tecneeq: in wich case i wouldn't bother
11:35  tecneeq: ok, that established, are there namespace conflicts between tasks and packages? are there packages that have the same name a task has
11:35  tecneeq: AFAIK that's not the case
11:36  Kamping_Kaiser: tasksel --list has a list of task names
11:36  Kamping_Kaiser: none of them look to me like they cdonflict
11:36  tecneeq: right
11:38  nsadmin: puppet is the perl6 implementation?
11:38  nsadmin: wait, that's parrot
11:39  Kamping_Kaiser: heh
11:48  tecneeq: nsadmin: nope, puppet is a configuration management system written in ruby. quite good actually.
11:53  Phil: anyone have any idea how a user would give permission for another user/all users to run GUI apps on their session manager?
11:57  tecneeq: Phil: the use types ,,xhost +'', then any user can use the display. the remote user types ,,export DISPLAY=hostname:0.0 ; xterm'' and the xterm will appear remote
11:57  tecneeq: Phil: you can omit the hostname if you are working on the same host
11:58  holms: hello , can please somebody help me with keys? "Server refused our key" always appears, this key is converted with puttygen... default key has another error anyway, i tried billion of manuals already
11:58  Phil: user running the xserver does what, sorry? :S
11:58  tecneeq: Phil: does that: xhost +
11:59  Phil: ok, so that says access control is disabled and clients can connect from any host
12:00  Phil: then doing "export DISPLAY=:0 ; firefox" as root on the same box gives an error
12:00  tecneeq: right. now the remote user exports the display used to display the window: export DISPLAY=hostname:0.0
12:00  Phil: "Authentication Rejected"
12:01  tecneeq: strange, let me test this
12:01  holms: anybody =/?
12:02  tecneeq: Phil: works fine for me
12:02  Kamping_Kaiser: holms: what do the logs say?
12:02  Phil: tecneeq, it runs but it ignores the command line arguments
12:03  Phil: Authentication Rejected, reason: None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed.
12:03 --- kerfe is now known as grank
12:04  Kamping_Kaiser: Phil: what protocol did you specify?
12:04  Phil: Kamping_Kaiser, I didn't specify anything - just following what tecneeq said
12:05  Kamping_Kaiser: ok, i'll leave you with him then
12:06  Phil: as I said, it runs but ignores the command line arguments
12:06  Phil: and throws that error
12:07  tecneeq: sorry dude, xhost is all i know and use

12:13  Phil: anyone else have any idea?
12:23  mrcarrot: i have a interesting problem... i have to "clone" a server to another.
12:23  mrcarrot: this would be easy except for one detail
12:23  Phil: mrcarrot, dd is your friend
12:24  mrcarrot: the new server will use software raid
12:24  Phil: not so much of a clone, really
12:24  mrcarrot: that means that sda1 will become md0
12:24  mrcarrot: and that fstab will be updated and such
12:25  mrcarrot: where do debian store all the settings, because each time i do dist-upgrade it will revert everything back to sda from the mirror
12:25  yuri___: Good morning. I've got serious troubles booting Debian on LVM root partition.
12:26  mrcarrot: and the second question, is debian creating by itself a initrd... i mean, will it have the modules for to boot a raid system
12:26  yuri___: from what I can see, initrd doesn't do vgchange -y and no entry is written into /dev/disk/by-label . Is this by design or a bug?
12:26  yuri___: *vgchange -ay
12:26 * babilen mumbles initramfs
12:27  yuri___: that is, I have a LABELed LVM partition
12:27  mrcarrot: i have been doing xfsdumps from the original server... all i have to do is to dump them to the new server... but those two questions are an obstacle before i can proceed to restore them
12:29  yuri___: also, does debian have somewhere a list of kernel boot parameters that modify initrd's behaviour?
12:29  yuri___: like rootdelay, resume, and so on
12:32  yuri___: what's the proper way of building initrd? is there any standard procedure?
12:32  CissWit: Hi, i was wondering why there where so many default user in /etc/passwd : mail, news, proxy, www-data, irc, list ... when i have none of this service installed.
12:32  CissWit: were*
12:33  WormFood: think of them as reserved users...so you don't use them by mistake
12:33  WormFood: that way it keeps the names and UIDs uniform across different installs
12:34  CissWit: hum ok.
12:35  WormFood: they're disabled by  default. They are not a security risk (or should not be)
12:35  yuri___: how do I find out what scripts are run when package is installed?
12:35  WormFood: also, if you have a files from another machine, when you look at the owner, you'll get the name instead of the uid
12:36  WormFood: yuri___, read the dpkg docs
12:37  yuri___: WormFood: could you tell me the specific option, please?
12:37  yuri___: I know how to list contents and info, but I want scripts
12:37  CutMeOwnThroat: !tell yuri___ -about postrm
12:38  CutMeOwnThroat: the postinstall ones are in the same place
12:38  WormFood: if I did that, then I'd have to do the same thing I just told you to do....read the docs....if I remember correctly, dpkg will show you that info, but I don't remember the specifics
12:39  yuri___: I can't unpack it, no free space
12:39  yuri___: is there anything like rpm -q --scripts pack.rpm
12:40  CutMeOwnThroat: what?

13:06  yuri___: I see debian installer allows me to select LVM install. How is that possible that initrd doesn't have vgchange -ay ?
13:06  tagtag: i've installed linux image 2.6.32 via backport on lenny, but now I have sound from hardware ( on previous kernel, I had removed pcspkr )
13:07  babilen: tagtag: You can blacklist the module
13:07  Lonniebiz: Hey, I've been using Ubuntu since 7.04; I want to use debian now for my laptop. What the best image to download?
13:07  tagtag: babilen: I did, pcspkr is not loaded anymore
13:07  Lonniebiz: How about this live testing image http://live.debian.net/       ????
13:07  tagtag: babilen: but with new kernel, I think there is a new other module
13:08  babilen: !tell Lonniebiz -about netinstall
13:08  Lonniebiz: link?
13:08  Lonniebiz: Totally new to debian, need a little direction to get started.
13:09  abrotman: started with what?
13:09  Lonniebiz: I like Ubuntu Live CDs, is that a bad idea on debian?
13:09  Lonniebiz: and I need to have all the same apt on debian, I do on ubuntu (most of them anyway).
13:09  abrotman: okay, so why not just use ubuntu?
13:10  tagtag: babilen: any other idea ? :p

13:10  babilen: tagtag: Well, there are different ways to disable the bell.
13:10  abrotman: Lonniebiz: well, Ubuntu and Debian are not the same .. so they don't work the same, and you won't have the same packages
13:10  Lonniebiz: Well, isn't Ubuntu just a middle man for me?
13:10  babilen: !tell tagtag about bell
13:11  sylarrr: which DNS daemon is recomended?
13:11  babilen: tagtag: And I don't think that the pcspkr module changed its name
13:11  babilen: sylarrr: bind9 -- but what is the usecase?
13:11  tagtag: babilen: so it's still have bell on editors
13:12  Lonniebiz: here are all the packages I install on ubuntu:   http://pastebin.com/hA7zu79T
13:12  babilen: tagtag: "xset b off" should take care of that in graphical environments. Read the factoid
13:12  tagtag: Oki
13:12  Lonniebiz: Won't all that stuff be on debian too?
13:13  sylarrr: babilen, SOHO wishing to serve  DNS quires for its own hosts, SOHO has static IP
13:14  babilen: sylarrr: To the outside world?
13:14  CutMeOwnThroat: Lonniebiz, most of it
13:14  sylarrr: babilen, yes
13:14  tagtag: babilen: and eh... just last question, does it disable permanently ?
13:14  babilen: sylarrr: I recommend bind
13:15  sylarrr: babilen, bind = bind9?
13:15  babilen: tagtag: No, you would have to execute that on startup. But AFAIK pcspkr should already be blacklisted, but who knows what is going on.
13:15  babilen: sylarrr: yes
13:15  Lonniebiz: I download the Debian Live CD from here: http://live.debian.net/   Any draw back to using that to install Debian on my laptop?
13:16  rozie: Lonniebiz: do you want to install with debootstrap?
13:16  tagtag: babilen: yep I blacklisted manually
13:16  Lonniebiz: I don't even know what that is rozie.
13:16  rozie: Lonniebiz: how do you want to install from live?
13:16  Lonniebiz: I'm spoiled with Ubuntu, and don't know what I'm getting into, but like the idea of running debian. Look for any guidance.
13:17  babilen: Lonniebiz: Read the private message you got from dpkg -- Download the netinstall if you have a working (wired) internet connection during the install or don't need a graphical environment directly after the install. Download CD1 or one of its flavours (Gnome (default), KDE, XFCE, ...) if not
13:17  babilen: !tell Lonniebiz about ig
13:17  rozie: so I see drawback: with debootstrap you need to know what you're doing, it has no wizard
13:18  rozie: !tell rozie about ig
13:18  babilen: rozie: I doubt that Lonniebiz actually planned to install with debootstrap
13:18  Lonniebiz: Ok, I've download a whole bunch of stuff. For example I download all the debian dvds for 5. Do I just burn dvd1 and boot from it to install?
13:18  babilen: rozie: You can /msg the bot
13:18  Lonniebiz: or are those dvds just a package repository?
13:18  rozie: babilen: oh. good to know. just wondered what ig is ;)
13:18  babilen: Lonniebiz: That would work.
13:19  rozie: babilen: now I see what he meant. first I understood that he asks of debootstrap drawbacks
13:20  babilen: Lonniebiz: No, those DVDs contain *every single Debian package known to mankind*, which basically means that you wasted a lot of bandwith as you will never install all of them. Furthermore, make sure that you have one of the online repositories enabled
13:20  babilen: !tell Lonniebiz about sources.list
13:21  rozie: Lonniebiz: what network card do you have? the only problem you can encouter installing with official installer is not supported network card (non-free firmware etc.)
13:21  Lonniebiz: I have dell studio 17, not sure what the network card is in it.
13:21  rozie: the rest should be taken from network, as usually there are security updates
13:21  Lonniebiz: I thought the linux kernel handled all these types of thing.
13:22  babilen: Lonniebiz: Paste the output of "lspci -nn|grep -i ethernet"
13:22  Lonniebiz: In ubuntu, after install, it tells me about firmware for my wireless card, I just click that I want it then my wireless card starts working.

13:26  abrotman: Lonniebiz: i can tell you that not all those packages exist in Debian
13:26  Lonniebiz: I thought it would be as easy as installing the OS from a live cd and then adding the packages I want, but it is way more involved than that?
13:27  brainsoft: how can I find the lastest created files in the system for example from yesterday to today?
13:27  babilen: Lonniebiz: Yes, it is more involved than that.
13:27  iess: brainsoft:you can check man pages of find
13:27  Lonniebiz: dang it.
13:28  abrotman: Lonniebiz: Debian doesn't currently let you install from the liveCD
13:28  Lonniebiz: Is it worth the hassle for a laptop desktop system, or would you recommend just sticking with ubuntu?

13:29  Lonniebiz: abrotman: I found a live CD here:   http://live.debian.net/
13:29  abrotman: Lonniebiz: that's up to you .. i use Debian on a few laptops
13:29  abrotman: Lonniebiz: yes .. that's the Debian live cd .. but you can't install to a hard drive with it
13:29  Lonniebiz: oh, wow.
13:29 * abrotman doesn't see why that's a big deal
13:29  Lonniebiz: So, I guess Ubuntu is there for a reason, huh?
13:29  iaj: can someone tell me what I have to do to be able to sudo over ssh connections?
13:30  abrotman: Lonniebiz: it's for people that don't want everything done for them
13:30  abrotman: erm ..
13:30  abrotman: that do want everything done for them
13:31  Lonniebiz: I see. Well, I've just been sick of a few bugs in ubuntu, lately and heard about how stable debian is.....
13:31  vtts: iaj, sudo is not ssh dependant, and permissions have to be granted to you (sudoers file)
13:32  abrotman: Lonniebiz: that's fine .. but they're not the same .. Debian doesn't do some of the magic stuff that ubuntu does .. it just means you have to do more work
13:32  Lonniebiz: I didn't thing it would be all that different to install and maintain.
13:32  iaj: vtts: you sure? i got an entry in my sudoers file.. /etc/sudoers for my user... eg it looks the same way as root does.. however I can't sudo stuff :\ always says incorrect password
13:32  Lonniebiz: I see.

13:35  iaj: another thing - how can I change keyboard layout for my ttys?
13:35  iess: iaj: can you sudo directly on the host you ssh to
13:36  sylarrr: babilen, any good howto for bind9? web interface?
13:36  babilen: iaj: One of the motivations for using sudo on your systems is that you don't have to give every user the root password in order to enable them to perform administrative tasks
