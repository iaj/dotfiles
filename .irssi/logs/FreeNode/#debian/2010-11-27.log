00:42  macdice: how can i tell if/when postgresql-9.0 might reach squeeze or squeeze-backports?
00:43  macdice: http://packages.qa.debian.org/p/postgresql-9.0.html says 'too young, 8 of 10 days old' which is hopeful except there are other reasons listed too including 'not considered'
00:44  tharkun: macdice: if postgres is not in squeeze on this moment. You need some luck and wait for backports to have it when squeeze becomes stable
00:44  Kamping_Kaiser: macdice: if its not in squeeze now it won't be
00:46  macdice: ah i see, thanks.  so backports is the only hope then
00:46  tharkun: ,versions postgresql

01:27  rgr: whats the name of the network-manager applet/status for the gnome taskbar? I cant seem to find it. Should it be there automatically? (squeeze)
01:28  chovy: anyone know if there is software to convert hdtv signal to analog for older tvs?
01:32  thewanderer1: chovy: there sure is! or rather, firmware. embedded in those tiny boxes you get at ebay :P
01:32  thewanderer1: rgr: nm-applet
01:35  rgr: thanks
01:35  rgr: its not in the "add to panel" optios though
01:38  rgr: thewanderer1: what can I run to configure which wireless access point I use? There is nothing in the gnome panel that I can see.
01:39  thewanderer1: rgr: I don't understand the question... you set the ESSID normally in nm-applet's preferences
01:39  rgr: there is no nm-applet visible. It used to be.
01:39  rgr: synaptic says its installed.
01:41  Mr_Queue: Any one have a repo for chrome unstable?

01:44  emerson: ?
01:44  Kamping_Kaiser: emerson: have you looked at the backports site?
01:44  rgr: and there is no nm-applet in the repos according to synaptic.
01:45  emerson: Kamping_Kaiser: not yet, I even don't know that has one ...
01:45  Kamping_Kaiser: dpkg: tell emerson about backports

01:47  smacnay: I have a samba share with a bunch of symlinked directories.  For some reason, users cannot follow the symlinks even though the "follow symlinks" option is set to "yes".  Is there a trick to getting symlinks to work?

16:53  dutchfish: maybe lilypond (2.12.3-7) is a candidate for hinting?
16:54  mirak: hi
16:55  gizmore: http://pastebin.com/wRtf7q42 Help or push is appreciated
16:55  jetscreamer: -_-
16:59  dutchfish: gizmore: for postfix: auth required pam_permit.so (at the top of my head)
17:00  gizmore: dutchfish: thank you very much. i will try :)
17:00  mirak: hello
17:00  dutchfish: gizmore: yw
17:01  Sark: Hello guys.
17:01  mirak: is it possible if B-1.5 package depends of A-1.5 , to prevent any automatic upgrade of A to A-1.6 if B-1.6 doesn't exist yet ?
17:02  jetscreamer: !hold
17:02  dpkg: hold is probably a status flag that tells the package manager not to automatically upgrade a package.  To hold a package: 'echo <package> hold|dpkg --set-selections'.  It is also possible to use aptitude: 'aptitude hold <package>'.  Note that the hold flag set using aptitude might be ignored by other package managers (i.e. Update Manager and Synaptic), but aptitude will respect the hold set in the dpkg database.
17:02  gizmore: dutchfish: does not seem to work :(
17:02  mirak: jetscreamer, I know hold, but I mean it at package creation
17:03  dutchfish: gizmore: check the postfix pages, it is in there somewhere
17:03  gizmore: oki, thank you :)
17:03  mirak: jetscreamer, I am rereading some docs but forgot some parts
17:04  mirak: jetscreamer, the idea is that it should not require a user operation
17:04  jetscreamer: no idea
17:04  mirak: A-1.6 would unlock only if B-1.6 is made available
17:05  abrotman: mirak: is it trying to remove package B ?
17:05  dutchfish: gizmore: this of course only works for local users only
17:05  gizmore: dutchfish: yes, i have mysqldb for virtual users, and i have my own email as local user
17:05  dutchfish: gizmore: ok
17:07  mirak: abrotman, no, the package B is left there but is unfunctionnal
17:07  dutchfish: gizmore: order might be important to (not sure)
17:07  mirak: abrotman, B is a plugin of A, and if A version increases, A can't load B.
17:08  gizmore: dutchfish:  pam_permit is a PAM module that always permit access. It does nothing else.  :P
17:09  abrotman: mirak: so how is this an apt problem ?
17:09  dutchfish: gizmore: yep, but auth required in front makes it so
17:09  mirak: abrotman, since I prefer have an older version of A-1.5 with B-1.5, than A-1.6 without B, I would prefer A-1.6 to not install.
17:09  gizmore: dutchfish: hmm ok
17:09  abrotman: mirak: or you could stop being vague
17:10  dutchfish: gizmore: by default it refers to local users
17:10  dutchfish: gizmore: but again, it must be in the postfix pages
17:10  mirak: abrotman, or you can read again, I said I want to package B in a way that A-1.5 will not upgrade to A-1.6 if B-1.6 doens't exist yet
17:10  abrotman: nope .. not playing
17:11  mirak: abrotman, I am reading the doc of course http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html
17:14  mirak: I am not sure if I must use something like Conflicts:   A ( > 1.5 )     for instance

18:09  paxcoder: hello. i've tried to apt-get install glade, it says it is "is not available, but is referred to by another package". I tried to apt-cache search for it, but found nothing. I'm using sqeeze, but pinned sid. Ideas, does it fetch on your squeeze installs?
18:09  Drakeson: assume I installed a package and later on removed some of its recommended or suggested packages.  The main package is still installed.  How can I ask for reinstallation of package and its suggestions?
