00:02  ondrejk: hi, ive been used to arch linux, now im running squeeze and thinking about sid, how "stable" is it?
00:02  ondrejk: i dont want to solve problems related to upgrade every week ...
00:04  Iridos: well, it's called "unstable"... what do YOU think?
00:04  Iridos: !unstable
00:04  dpkg: [unstable] The status of a Debian release when packages can be added to the system at any time that might disrupt the integrity of the whole system!  Ask me about <break>.  Not supported here, in general.  It's also newspeak for not stable.  If you have to ask whether you should use it or how, you shouldn't.  apt-get install apt-listbugs apt-listchanges (!)  See also <testing>, <sid>, <sid faq>, <apt-listbugs>, <apt-listchanges>, <bts>.
00:04  ondrejk: Iridos: i know, i just wanted to ask some sid user how usable it is
00:04  nevyn: and it's named for the kid in toystory that breaks all his toys
00:04  Iridos: tortures them, really :)
00:05  ondrejk: well, i just wanted to know if it's usable for everyday work
00:06  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: Not suitible.
00:06  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: Unless your everyday work is finding and fixing bugs in Linux software...
00:07  icebrain: works fine here, although you might have some bugs.
00:07  ondrejk: icebrain: for example? can it break whole system?
00:07  ondrejk: or it's just "cosmetic" bugs?
00:07  jhutchins_lt: You WILL have bugs, packages that are broken are released into sid all the time in order to find and fix the bugs.
00:08  Iridos: did you read the factoid?
00:08  icebrain: ondrejk: possibly, but nothing in the last year
00:08  icebrain: but some packages do break
00:08  ondrejk: Iridos: factoid?
00:08  Iridos: there's some nice famous ones involving glibc or the boot process
00:08  Iridos: what dpkg said
00:08  jhutchins_lt: icebrain: That's probably because of the squeeze freeze ,but it's not the way to bet.  It's OK for advanced users who know how to roll back an update but it's not appropriate for regular users.
00:09  jhutchins_lt: icebrain: ... and please don't tell people it is unless you're willing to be their 24/7 support.
00:09  icebrain: jhutchins_lt: I simply said the facts, I haven't recommended anything
00:09  jhutchins_lt: icebrain: Just because you can't find the bug doesn't mean it's not there.
00:10  ondrejk: jhutchins_lt: i know in sid will be bugs, i just wanted to know how bad they are usually
00:10  icebrain: jhutchins_lt: that's why I said "works fine _here_"
00:10  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: Hard to tell.  Squeeze bugs have recently made systems unable to use the GUI.
00:11  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: They can be minor, the problem is that it's ok for sid to have bugs that destroy data.
00:11  ondrejk: jhutchins_lt: that could be problem for me
00:11  ondrejk: missing gui it's not a problem, im 99% time in screen
00:12  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: Debian's stability and reliablity are some of it's best advantages, but to get their benefit you need to run stable,
00:12  jhutchins_lt: ondrejk: Unless you're comfortable running stable and are familiar enough to get newer packages you need installed by backporting them you're really not ready to work on the testing team.
00:13  jhutchins_lt: ...which is what you're doing if you're not running stable.
00:13  Iridos: also mind that the current state is not typical... squeeze is frozen to become stable
00:13  Iridos: and sid doesn't get as many updates because of that either
00:13  nsadmin: jhutchins_lt: oh really? not sure I understand... so if anyone runs testing, they have a job?
00:13  ondrejk: im running squeeze for about ... half of a year, maybe more
00:13  jhutchins_lt: nsadmin: Right.  Many don't do the job, but they should.
00:14  kj4: squeeze runs fine for me
00:14  jhutchins_lt: kj4: Yes, runs fine for many testers.
00:14  jhutchins_lt: kj4: Crashes horribly for others.
00:14  nsadmin: but that's based on a limited viewpoint that only testers should run (!stable)
00:14  kj4: jhutchins_lt: probably depends a lot on the hardware?
00:14  jhutchins_lt: Squeeze crashes generally don't destroy data; restore your checkpoint and go on.
00:15  jhutchins_lt: kj4: Hardware and package selection, sure.
00:15  tbsaunde: jhutchins_lt:  but afaik horrible crashes are rare
00:15  jhutchins_lt: tbsaunde: Um.  Not recently.  Just some people never manage to trigger them.
00:15  kj4: jhutchins_lt: gotcha- runs without any issue on my laptop (xfce, virtualbox, chromium)
00:16  jhutchins_lt: This is called an "argument from ignorance" - because you have not experienced it does not have any bearing on whether the problem exists.  it's irrelevant, really, just means you won't know how to fix it.
00:16  tbsaunde: jhutchins_lt:  yes, but you also spend a lot of time here, so just looking at that isn't a great sample, not that there is a good one
00:16  nsadmin: once you expand that to "since it's available for download, anyone can use it" and "dfsg guidelines #6 says no discrimination due to field of endeavor", more than what you're trying to restrict to is possible.
00:17  jhutchins_lt: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance
00:17  Iridos: kj4, I had several kernel panics a day until I figured out what caused them 3 weeks ago...
00:17  Iridos: sqeeze, not unstable, mind you
00:17  kj4: jhutchins_lt: i really wasnt arguing- i don't doubt what you have said at all, i'm simply offering my personal experience on a particular machine
00:17  jhutchins_lt: Oh I don't want to restrict who can test it - I just don't want people to think it's stable and suitible for production.
00:18  jhutchins_lt: ...just because someone hasn't found the bugs yet.
00:18  jhutchins_lt: We know the bugs are there.
00:19  nsadmin: but that's not what you said originally :) if you want to add that as a separate part, that's fine... but saying that running !stable is necessarily working for a team, is a completely different statement
00:19  inetd50: do you guys have any issues with firefox sound? (like after sometime when you play flash video sound crackles)
00:19  jhutchins_lt: The critical bugs graph is a good way to see whether it's "ready"
00:19  tbsaunde: jhutchins_lt:  yes, I probably wouldn't run testing on a server, and definitely wouldn't run unstable, but my personal laptop is a bit different
00:19  nsadmin: inetd50: do you have issue with firefox sound?
00:19  richo: Is there an apt repo with Python 2.7 in it?
00:19  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: It's flash, not firefox, there are known bugs.
00:19  richo: I can't seem to find it anywhere, not in sid or experimental ?
00:20  jhutchins_lt: tbsaunde: As an alternate boot partition is different.  On a spare you can do without is different.  If you have snapshot backups to fall back to is different.
00:20  richo: nvm
00:20  richo: I'm a moron
00:20  inetd50: nsadmin: well its not firefox itself..its when i play flash
00:21  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: 32 or 64?
00:21  tbsaunde: jhutchins_lt:  yes, the point was we shouldn't advise everybody like they're running a server, but we shouldn't tell everyone to testing is fine either
00:21  nsadmin: flash combined with not so much mem available is a big iceweasel crasher
00:22  jhutchins_lt: tbsaunde: We should recommend that people run stable untill they're familiar with how to fix problems in Debian, and run testing if they want to help refine it and have the necessary skills.
00:23  inetd50: jhutchins_lt: 32
00:23  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: Lenny?  No pulseaudio?
00:23  nsadmin: does squeeze use sysvinit or upstart?
00:23  arcsky: i did "ip -6 addr flush dev eth1" how can i get an link-local address in another way then take the interface down/up ?
00:24  inetd50: jhutchins_lt: squeeze and no pulse
00:24  tbsaunde: nsadmin:  sysvnit
00:24  jhutchins_lt: which chipset?
00:24  inetd50: jhutchins_lt: hda intel
00:24  tbsaunde: nsadmin:  you might be able to use upstart if you want, but I'm not sure why you would
00:24  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: Got the same one and no current problems, you're fully updated?
00:25  nsadmin: well upstart would require packages with daemons to code their start/stop script differently
00:25  jhutchins_lt: upstart also works much better on newer hardware than old.
00:25  inetd50: jhutchins_lt: symptoms doesnt show up always.. it happens when i run firefox for sometime...and then start playing some flash
00:25  nsadmin: what's one example that suggests why that is?
00:26  inetd50: jhutchins_lt: initially when firefox starts flash works ok
00:26 --- TheNetuno is now known as Guest26057
00:26  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: It may depend on the particular flash videos.
00:26  jhutchins_lt: inetd50: Is this a laptop?
00:27  tbsaunde: nsadmin:  well, I'm not sure what to tell you, but upstart appears to be in the repo so...

00:29  themill: No idea. I neither use pidgin nor icq. But at least we now know what your real question is. Did ICQ change its protocol again?
00:30  jhutchins_lt: angel-tsankov: what version are you using (or trying to use)?
00:30  angel-tsankov: may be yes, may be no

00:31  jhutchins_lt: angel-tsankov: Try the one for backports.  I know it solves an AOL problem.
00:31  jhutchins_lt: !tell angel-tsankov about bdo
00:31  angel-tsankov: jhutchins_lt: where do I get this from
00:31  jhutchins_lt: angel-tsankov: See msg from dpkg.
00:32  angel-tsankov: ok, thanks
00:34  arcsky: if i change something in /etc/sysctl.conf  do i have to reboot ?
00:35  jhutchins_lt: arcsky: What did you change?
00:38  arcsky: jhutchins_lt: uncomment "#" for IPV6 forwarding
00:39  jhutchins_lt: arcsky: Well, you'll need to make some other changes as well, but you can enable forwarding without rebooting.

00:43  arcsky: jhutchins_lt: tthanks ye i know
00:44  jhutchins_lt: arcsky: Once you echo 1 to the forwarding control file it's enabled, that's what the sysctl file does.

00:49  dirk`: jhutchins: i just wanna know why are not all open ports are shown
00:49  dirk`: i remember, that i worked like this a few weeks ago
00:50  jhutchins_lt: Perhaps the ports you think are open aren't.
00:51  dirk`: jhutchins_lt: i can connect through the port, but it's not shown in nmap
00:51  jhutchins_lt: Hm, it should show 2211 shouldn't it?
00:52  dirk`: when using nmap -p1024-5000 it shows the open port
00:52  dirk`: but i remember that it shows the ports a few weeks ago without defining a port range
00:54  dirk`: well, anyway, the ports are shown when defining a port range, so i did not went crazy :)
00:54  dirk`: cyall :)

01:26  stew: xixor: amd64
01:27  stew: xixor: or i386, but not ia64, ia64 is something completely different (itanium2)

The goal of Itanium was to produce a "post-RISC era" arch using EPIC.  See http://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/ -- if your CPU is opteron/athlon64/turion/sempron/xeon/em64t/pentium/core2duo/core*, then it is NOT ia64, it's <amd64>.

01:34  dpkg: 1) add yourself to the 'audio' group (log out and log in again)  2) use alsamixer and unmute channels and raise levels (also try muting some channels & toggle jack sense)  3) arts or esound stopped?  4) OSS modules unloaded?  5) speakers on?  6) modprobe snd-pcm-oss  7) does "aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav" work for root?  Test your sound with aplay and a wav so codec issues don't confuse the situation.  See also <list alsa users>.

01:51  Pyista42: any of you use nginx? i installed it but it does not start by default. unlike apache and lighttpd, just curious why
01:52  fenugreek: dpkg -L nginx, see if it has an init script you can start
01:52  dpkg: No packages found matching nginx, see if it has an init script you can start
01:52  abrotman: or look in /etc/default/ to see if there's a file that controls it
01:54  blahdeblah: username17: preach it!  :-)
01:57  Pyista42: fenugreek: just curious why it did not do it by default
02:00  fenugreek: Pyista42: probably because whichever dev was responsible for it thought most users wouldn't want it to
02:00  fenugreek: but your system could also be less than perfectly stable, or the dev could be less than perfect, etc.

02:00  fenugreek: nginx caters more to the sort of users who might not like automagick
02:00  fenugreek: IMO
02:00  Pyista42: ah
02:01  Pyista42: starts fine using normal debian conventions
02:01  fenugreek: latenite: might see if webmin has one
02:02  latenite: fenugreek, nahh I want to sutomis its css to my wishes. I feel webmin is a litte to overloaded for that...
02:02  darkkrai: using aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav as root offers no output :/

02:17  nevyn: and X11 forwarding.

02:20  Ferris-: thanks, nev & cusco
02:21  cusco: Ferris-: but yea, for visual ssh with X forwarding allows you to open graphical stuff
02:21  Ferris-: sorta... I tried to SSH into this machine and couldnt... It doesnt have a screen, so i'm trying to arrange a way to connect to it and use it remotely without having to log in first (so i can turn it off, carry it to somewhere that has ethernet, then use it)
02:22  cusco: install openssh-server first
02:22  Ferris-: okay ^_^
02:23  Rockj: Q: is it possible to make find only show the last part of it's "path"?  like using  find / will list the whole path up to the file/directory. I'm only interessted in the last part. Ex:  find /downloads -maxdepth 1 , I'm not interested in having /downloads in the output.
02:24  nevyn: cd /downloads find . -maxdepth 1  should do it
02:24  Rockj: so I have to cd the directory?
02:24  Rockj: ok, gotto make my script do that then.
02:25  xixor: so the default in a debian install is ext3fs?
02:26  nevyn: check first.. but it might be easier than finding the option to find to strip the first element of the directory
02:26  Ferris-: sigh... Do i need to gain administrator/root access? sudo and using my password tells me i dont have permissions for that
02:26  nevyn: you need root acess to do this.
02:26  nevyn: Ferris-: to do what?
02:27  cusco: Rockj: easier to cd the dir, but can also use basename
02:27  nevyn: Ferris-: so install sudo (as root) and use visudo to edit sudoers.
02:27  Rockj: cusco: hm, what is basename? man find doesn't mention it
02:27  Rockj: ohhh

02:50  Rockj: stew: I ended up using basename.   find files in (find ...), then adding another helper variable which pushes basename $files . I just have one problem with that current solution, it lists the root dir too in the "find /root_dir" results

02:52  stew: Rockj: -mindepth 1 is what you want then

02:53  Rockj: nvm, my fault
02:53  Rockj: -mindepth 1 did the trick.
02:53  Rockj: using -printf '%f\n' probably deals with me not having to use IFS=$'\n' ?

03:04  stew: mklappstuhl: if you have partitions like /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2, you might try "file -s /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2"

03:07  Pyista42: I need ruby 1.9 in debian and something newer then 1.9.0
03:07  Pyista42: how should i go about this?
03:07  daveb_: hello #debian
03:07  Roasted: Is there a way to verify the integrity of the debian cd I burned like ubuntu does? I burned at slowest speed, but this debian CD for my PPC Mac keeps hanging at 52% during the partitioner.... :(
03:08  shane4ubuntu: ok, from Ubuntu I chroot into my debian (new install) with this script: http://pastebin.com/FJF37Fgm
03:08  shane4ubuntu:   then when I exit, it refuses to umount /mnt/debian device busy, any thoughts??
03:08 --- {{local_host}} is now known as {{localhost}}
03:09  Pyista42: anyone?
03:10  Rockj: Pyista42: ruby1.9 is already in debian lenny. (stable)
03:11  stew: Pyista42: install ruby1.9.1 from backports: /msg dpkg bdo
03:11  stew: Pyista42: assuming you are on stable
03:12  stew: shane4ubuntu: you might look at schroot, which can do things like automatically mount stuff for you
03:12  stew: (and umount)
03:12  Rockj: oh, he said newer then 1.9.0, my fault
03:12  Rockj: anyway, time to sleep. nn guys :-)
03:12  shane4ubuntu: stew: and not use my well tested, trusted handwritten script???  :)
03:13  shane4ubuntu: stew: I will check into it thanks!!
03:14  shane4ubuntu: stew: actually I think the problem was caused by somehow my fstab that I wrote having an error, and I don't feel like rebooting to see if my new fstab fixed that.

03:23  f8l: Hello. I just rebooted after a really strange swap hell. After I mved about 700000 files to my external disk, my system started to swap wildly. Even simple `free -m` in console took about a minute to execute.
03:25  f8l: I thought: "Well, probably the mv command keeps all the inode numbers to delete after copying.", but it didn't stop to swap even after mv exited.
03:26  chrisb: f8l: at one time, i seem to remember mv not working across filesystems at all
03:26  macrobat: so, memory was needed to keep track of the transmission?
03:27  f8l: What I noticed was quite high (about 80%) share of "buffers" (as reported by free) in used memory. Is it normal?
03:27  f8l: chrisb: What do you mean?
03:28  f8l: macrobat: No. The external disk spun down shortly after copying, and while mv was removing files from source disk.
03:32  chrisb: f8l: from info
03:32  chrisb: f8l: Prior to version `4.0' of the fileutils, `mv' could move only regular files between file systems.
03:32  chrisb: f8l: it couldn't move directory structures
03:34  stew: and that was what? 10-15 years ago?
03:35  f8l: chrisb: I run a recent system. I don't think this is the reason.
03:36  omgdebian: hey guys.. if i block internap.com on my server will i still be able to update from an alternative repo?
03:36  neil_d: Hi, I have three mdadm raid 1 partitions, whenever I boot /dev/md0 comes up degraded [U_] :( .... everything seems ok in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf ... when I manually readd the parittion is works file.. how can I find out what is wrong?
03:36  f8l: I suspect some kind of memory leak, but do memory leaks last after termination of program causing it?
03:36  dandgoliath: omgdebian: hms? blocking incoming / outgoing, or both?
03:37  omgdebian: well i dont want to have anything to do with internap
03:37  omgdebian: its way to slow
03:37  stew: f8l: no, they don't
03:38  stew: f8l: and it is very unlikely you found a memory leak in mv
03:39  f8l: stew: AFAIK mv does not do anything, but asks kernel to do the operation. Maybe it's a kernel issue?
03:40  stew: f8l: i believe that mv will cache all the inodes it sees so it can preserve hardlinks, I'd guess that the mv operation was using a lot of ram, causing other stuff to swap, after mv terminated, you noticed stuff getting swapped back in
03:40  f8l: And by the way, it was an ext4 -> xfs move.
03:40  omgdebian: dandgoliath: so will my debian server still update if i remove internap, or is that the only choice in debian?
03:41  xixor: Yo, I have just installed debian, but the grub install didn't work, and I can't get it to boot, always OS not found error.  I am trying to use the installer to re-run just the portion where it sets up grub, but I can't seem to find a way.  The list of options in the installation is quite shorter than I remember, I thought there was a "make system bootable" selection that would just launch the grub installer again?
03:41  dandgoliath: omgdebian: tonnes of other choices, modify /etc/apt/sources.list and choose another
03:41  stew: omgdebian: no, internap is certainly not the only choice, but there is no way from your server that you can affect whether or not some packet going to a debian mirror would be routed over internap or not
03:41  stew: omgdebian: "/msg dpkg mirrors" to get a list of mirrors, or perhaps have a look at the netselect-apt or apt-spy packages which will test mirrors trying to find one that is fast from your machine
03:42  omgdebian: stew: my only issue is that internap is "ghetto" and i always get updates from it hehe

03:43  omgdebian: yes
03:43  stew: omgdebian: try ftp.dk.debian.org or ftp.nl.debian.org
03:43  omgdebian: stew: i mean like apt-get update / update
03:44  omgdebian: i dont want any packages from internap hehe
03:44  stew: omgdebian: yes, use ftp.dk.debian.org or ftp.nl.debian.org in your sources.list (which is used by apt-get update)
03:44  f8l: stew: I waited very long, and the system didn't return to normal operation. I was running only X, xfce with some applets, and an IRC client – stuff that usually takes up to 300M RAM. I have 1G and still after about half an hour after mv termination, memory was reported to be all used, with 100M for programs, 800M for buffers, 50M for cache, and 300M of swap was used. These values oscillated over time as
03:45  f8l: various programmes were swapped in and out, despite they could easily fit in RAM alone.
03:45  omgdebian: i can get like 500MB down from others in no time... 5mb in interna would take 15 mins
03:45  omgdebian: hehe ok
03:45  stew: omgdebian: when you say "from internap" do you mean that the packets come from some other server but are routed over internap's backbone? or that you are actually using internap in your sources.list?
03:46  omgdebian: so replace http://ftp-mirror.internap.com stable Release etc with ftp.dk.debian.org stable Release ?
03:46  stew: omgdebian: replace it with http://ftp.dk.debian.org
03:46  stew: omgdebian: but you should not use "stable"
03:47  omgdebian: ah just making sure it wouldnt break anything hehe
03:47  stew: omgdebian: if you are on lenny (the current stable) use "lenny".  you should never use "stable" in sources.list fora debian mirror
03:47  stew: yes, using stable will eventually break stuff (when squeeze becomes stable)
03:47  omgdebian: hehe its a default install on a vps
03:47  stew: omgdebian: tell the administrator who installed it that way that it is a bad idea
03:48  omgdebian: i installed it
03:48  omgdebian: but didnt touch sources hehe
03:49  omgdebian: i guess its setup in their image tho
03:50  omgdebian: so i replace "stable main" "lenny main" ?
03:52  omgdebian: just to be 100% sure

03:56  omgdebian: internap was on like 5kb/s
03:57  Cullz: looking at http://wiki.debian.org/NTFS
03:57  Cullz: yes, debian boots and works
03:57  Cullz: sees other partition also but wont read it
03:57  magyar: dondelelcaro: my is jailbroken
03:58  f8l: Cullz: I've heard that there is an application for Windows that enables you to read ext filesystem from it, but I never needed to do so, thus I don't remember the name.
03:58  dondelelcaro: magyar: shouldn't matter
03:58  f8l: Cullz: You may want to check permissions and mount options.
03:58  Cullz: debian wont read windows partition either, which is more critical
03:58  Cullz: ok
03:58  dondelelcaro: Cullz: Debian can read ntfs partitions just fine
03:59  dondelelcaro: magyar: though if it's jailbroken, it may be able to become a usb mass storage filesystem; that's not really something that's on topic for #debian, though
03:59  magyar: dondelelcaro: nothing it doesn't work, dmesg is not showing anything

03:59  dondelelcaro: Cullz: no
04:00  dondelelcaro: Cullz: the read-only ntfs drivers are already built, and get loaded when you try to mount an ntfs partition
04:00  Cullz: ok, so I need to setup permissions and mount options

10:05  Bartzy: Kamping_Kaiser: Web server logs, firewall logs
10:05  Bartzy: Also, should I log accepted packets in the firewall log ?
10:05  Kamping_Kaiser: Bartzy: presumably so the entries make it to disk
10:06  Bartzy: Kamping_Kaiser: But it's only logs... I don't really care that they'll make it to disk a second before the server goes down
10:06  Bartzy: Also, those "sync"s are kernel write-cache ? not related to the hardware cache in the disk right ?
10:06  Kamping_Kaiser: Bartzy: then you might not care. if its the system log which explains why your server went down the lsat few seconds might be priceless
10:07  Bartzy: how can I change if it's sync or not ?
10:07  Bartzy: in syslog conf ?
10:07  Kamping_Kaiser: don't know.
10:07  Bartzy: or for example my web server logs.. that's only for the web server to decide if it's sync or not ?
10:12  dondelelcaro: Bartzy: generally you don't care if you loose a few log entries
10:12  dondelelcaro: s/loose/lose/
10:13  Bartzy: dondelelcaro: OK, but logs are "sync" by default ?
10:13  Bartzy: how do I change that ?
10:14  dondelelcaro: Bartzy: depends on what you're talking about. AFAIK, most of the log writers don't sync after each write
10:17  oracle: why would i run a bsd kernel on debian
10:18  arctanx: oracle: many people claim better performance for some tasks
10:18  arctanx: it'll come down to application and taste

10:19  Ecco_: Hi everyone
10:20  Ecco_: I got this Debian machine set up for me
10:20  Ecco_: How can I check it's not been compromised ?
10:20  Ecco_: It should pretty much be a "vanilla" Debian install
10:20  Ecco_: minus a few config files changed here and there (network config essentially)
10:21  arctanx: Ecco_: fundamentally speaking you can't know for certain that there isn't a rootkit or some other nasty installed, or some suspect config setting
10:21  Ecco_: Well, I do understand that
10:21  Ecco_: Actually it's a server I'm getting from a hosting company
10:21  Ecco_: So hopefully they aren't doing too "nasty" stuff
10:22  dondelelcaro: Ecco_: if it's a hosting company, you can generally give them an image to install
10:22  arctanx: that being the case they have physical (or in the case virtualisation - total) control of the machine anyway
10:22  Ecco_: Basically my question could be rephrased as "how can I see what they have modified, assuming they aren't trying to hide it"
10:23  Ecco_: arctanx: Yep, definitely. Let's just assume they aren't total bastards and aren't trying to hide things
10:23  Ecco_: for instance so far I've noticed they're not shipping the standard debian kernel
10:24  arctanx: for that, they might have left a config file in /boot, or you could ask for a copy of that
10:24  arctanx: if you have another machine you could grab /etc/ and diff it against another debian machine
10:32  Ecco_: yep, that would work
10:32  Ecco_: but I don't :-)
10:36  rotaticus: Ecco_: perhaps chkrootkit and/or rkhunter helps?
10:36  Ecco_: Yeah, I could give that a try as well
10:37  rotaticus: but i thin rkhunter builds up a chksumdb on first run
10:40  Bartzy: how should I disable ipv6 entirely in my system ?
10:41  rotaticus: rmmod ipv6 ?
10:41  liable_: !noipv6
10:41  dpkg: [noipv6] To disable use of <IPv6> on Lenny: echo install ipv6 /bin/true >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf (and reboot for this change to take effect).  From Squeeze onwards, IPv6 is built into the kernel, add the kernel command line option ipv6.disable=1 to your bootloader.
10:42  Bartzy: rotaticus: It's recommended if I don't actually use ipv6 ?
10:44  rotaticus: Bartzy: i'm just guessing

11:06  arvind_khadri: themill, when I checked my sources it was pointing to sid, I have made them now to point to lenny, now when I try to run an upgrade it complains of removing many packages.

11:14  themill: arvind_khadri: only 11 packages to remove... that's not so bad at all! It's to be expected that some packages will be removed in an upgrade between releases like this. A couple of them you might actually want (just reinstall them later), but lib* packages you can probably just let aptitude worry about for you.
11:15  themill: arvind_khadri: the three packages that it wants to keep at the current version are more of a worry, but you can probably sort them out yourself afterwards without any hassle
11:15  arvind_khadri: themill, :) ok thanks, I am doing a dist-upgrade with aptitude, thats the way to go,right ??

13:22  doublehp: jelly hard to know "hey, tomorrow Debian will randomly delete 100M of logs" ... don't know which folder i should run find in
13:22  dondelelcaro: frikinz: the first is a debian source package which is what is used to build Debian kernels
13:22  abrotman: nu1x: depends on the logrotate config
13:22  Iridos: they also get automatically removed if you're using logrotate and the defaults... i think 6 logs are kept, everything older is removed

13:25  doublehp: jelly so much to do, just to know which file been removed ? no daemon known to drop logs dispite logrotate.conf ? no wy to ask the journal ?
13:26  rozie:  guys. logrotate is configurable. you don't have to stick to default
13:27  Iridos: doublehp, you should read all that at "check if you're indeed using logrotate, look at its configuration"
13:27  stew: doublehp: realize that syslog has its own rotation separate from logrotate
13:27  jelly: doublehp: correct, for the general case

13:32  WormFood: is there an unofficial squeeze net install that actually works? (and by "works" I mean something that has the firmware files required by most common network cards)
13:32  rozie: IIRC rsyslog is default since Lenny
13:32  Iridos: doublehp, well, actually it's simple... you can just cross-check with the files in your backups...
13:32  jelly: rozie: syslog-ng never was default in Debian to the best of my knowledge
13:32  doublehp: laws in my country are strict: *ALL* logs MUST be kept 10y ! Debian is not helping me respecting my laws
13:33  doublehp: Iridos: ... backup ran at 2AM ... cron at 6 ... so, yes, should do :)
13:33  rozie: jelly: oh. always sticked to syslog-ng
13:33  rozie: doublehp: where are you from?
13:33  doublehp: rozie: France
13:33  Iridos: haha, France
13:33  rozie: that's strange. EU forces maximum of 2y for connection logs AFAIK
13:33  WormFood: doublehp, so you need to keep copies of all your boot logs, and your IRC logs, and stuff like that?
13:34  doublehp: rozie: all logs about "public services" must be kept 10y. as long as i don't know which logs are removed, some may be about public services ...
13:34  frikinz: doublehp: 10y? you must be wrong
13:34  WormFood: frikinz, I think he is wrong too...10 years is excessively long.
13:34  doublehp: syslog contains 90% of my email traffic for example ...
13:35  rozie: doublehp: emails logs are probably connection logs and fall under retention policy
13:35  jelly: doublehp: you may be logging mail.* in more than one file.  No need to.
13:35  WormFood: doublehp, how long have you been using Linux?
13:35  rozie: which specifies 2y at most
13:35  rozie: _at most_
13:35  doublehp: frikinz: LEN.2 voted in 2007 ... ten years. 5 years first, then, 5 years more since 1013 ... i am setting it up now.
13:36  doublehp: WormFood: first kiss in 1998 . Admin use since 2000.
13:36  jelly: doublehp: a standard part of my debian setup is getting rid of mail.{info,err,warn} and adding mail to .none part for /var/log/syslog
13:37  doublehp: first, i keep; later, i remove unwanted parts if i lack romm
13:38  WormFood: doublehp, then you should know that there are multiple log files for many different services. Your email logs are not in your syslog....not saying there isn't email info being logged there, but that isn't your email logs.
13:38  rozie: doublehp: double check the law. keeping email logs over 2y may be illegal. Take a look at http://searchengineland.com/google-responds-to-eu-cutting-raw-log-retention-time-reconsidering-cookie-expiration-11443
13:38  doublehp: WormFood: did not find any fresh file in exim folder
13:38  WormFood: I don't think you're a Linux admin
13:39  rozie: and I wouldn't keep logs on production machine
13:39  rozie: put them at some central (backup) point once a month or so
13:39  WormFood: yeah, good point rozie, they should be logged to another machine, off the internet (on the private network)
13:39  rozie: even if you have to have them, probably you don't need have them online
13:39  doublehp: first, i log; later, i removed the unwatned part. France != Europe . email was an example.
13:40  rozie: tape is enough
13:40  rozie: AFAIK France is in Europe. even in EU ;-)
13:40  jelly: shrug
13:41  WormFood: log to paper tape....hehehe
13:41  doublehp: you are right; the backup machine could do the job; it could backup the old logs, and, keep them even if the backup of live server removed them ... then, let the prod server remove them
13:41  doublehp: WormFood: paper tape ... human readable ? ^^
13:41  rozie: WormFood: well, they have to be computer readable IIRC
13:41  frikinz: "lcen 2 creates because of web 2.0" muahaha. can't find the text of the law though
13:42  doublehp: rozie: no, in case of lawcourts, the police is happy with human readable :)
13:42  WormFood: you need to learn how to configure your log file rotation scheme....I personally keep my logs for about 2-4 years, when I take the time to configure it....I don't keep them that long because I have to, but because I want to. (and not in a production server, on my home network)
13:42  WormFood: paper tape is machine readable....and if you know the codes, it is human readable, but probably tedious at best.
13:43  jelly: doublehp: I strongly suggest configuration of logging to have daily rotation and per-day file names (mail.2010-12-01.log or similar), instead of rotating and reusing file names
13:43  doublehp: jelly i did that already ... i did it manually for syslog !!!
13:44  jelly: doublehp: syslog-ng is your friend.  rsyslog is good enough as well, and default in lenny onwards, and much more backward compatible
13:44  jelly: my mail servers use rsyslog locally
13:46  krisfremen: i just had debian lenny's logrotate go into an infinite loop
13:47  WormFood: is there an unofficial squeeze net install that actually works? (and by "works" I mean something that has the firmware files required by most common network cards)
13:49  aidan: Can I upgrade to autoconf 2.65 in lenny?
13:49  frikinz: doublehp: I only see 1y R10-13. I see 10years for _contracts_ and not for general emails (of more than 120 euros; wtf)
13:49  themill: dpkg: tell WormFood about firmware images
13:50  jelly: aidan: it's in lenny-backports.  /msg dpkg bdo
13:50  cahoot: !noipv6
13:50  dpkg: [noipv6] To disable use of <IPv6> on Lenny: echo install ipv6 /bin/true >> /etc/modprobe.d/local.conf (and reboot for this change to take effect).  From Squeeze onwards, IPv6 is built into the kernel, add the kernel command line option ipv6.disable=1 to your bootloader.
13:51  doublehp: frikinz: removing unwatned is easy: find -rm ; first, i need to make sure i keep *ALL* in first place
13:51  doublehp: and Munin says from my disk % that i have very much removed
13:52  ttiicc: what the difference between curl wget? any one prefered? or newer?
13:52  WormFood: thanks themill, that is perfect (or at least it looks perfect)...will try it out.
13:52  jelly: ttiicc: curl is also a library.
13:53  doublehp: ttiicc: not the same use; wget has a spider option; curl is preferd when you need to output page in console of pipe

15:40  Iridos: shane4ubuntu, I think you could be a bit more specific on the last bit... around "went through quite a bit of booting, and then just hung there." :)
15:43  shane4ubuntu: Iridos: true, just not sure, where to find the info, I chrooted in and went to var/log/boot and it was empty!  I wish I had a photographic memory I would type what was on the screen.  I'm at a loss as to where to get info.  It didn't boot entirely, not even to console, so I had to reset.  I tried alt-ctrl-f1-7 and didn't get anywhere.
15:43  babilen: !bootlog
15:43  dpkg: extra, extra, read all about it, bootlogd is disabled by default.  Change /etc/default/bootlogd to "Yes" to populate /var/log/boot .  For the reason behind the default, see http://bugs.debian.org/213028 (fixed since sysvinit 2.86.ds1-11).  Not a command (as opposed to dmesg).
15:44  shane4ubuntu: babilen: ahh, thanks!!! I will fix that and reboot later when I have spare time to test it.
15:45  babilen: shane4ubuntu: No problem, but you understand that there is very little we could conclude from just "then just hung there" :)
15:46  shane4ubuntu: babilen: yes, absolutely, you are at as much of a loss as I was :)  the bootlog thing was key I guess, much appreciated, I can work on a problem when it is logged.
15:46  stew: a camera would have a photographic memory
15:47  jelly: only in RAW mode
15:47  shane4ubuntu: stew: the chroot problem was that I had mounted a drive as /home and didn't unmount it, so when I exited my chroot the main partition wouldn't umount because there was a mount in there. :)
15:47  shane4ubuntu: stew: I have seen screenshots like that, just couldn't bring myself to do that.
15:47  shane4ubuntu: ok, thanks guys
15:48 * shane4ubuntu gets back to studying

17:31  alanp: Is it possible to hide all notices when doing a system upgrade?  We're trying to script it but we get notices regarding obsoleted software, keymaps, restarting pam services.  I would like to suppress all of these and do the default action.
17:33  stew: alanp: use the 'noninteractive' debian frontend (see man 7 debconf)
17:34  alanp: stew: i'm using noninteractive, but i still get keymap, pam

17:39  Pyista42: what is a good mail server to use? i know good is subjective but i need something to send / recieve mail
17:40  pipeline: Pyista42: the debian default is exim.  Postfix is also a good choice.  You probably don't want a mail server, though.
17:40  Pyista42: huh?
17:40  pipeline: Pyista42: in general, when possible, you want to configure your local MTA to use a smarthost for all of its mail transmission
17:41  pipeline: Pyista42: running a mail server *sucks*
17:41  Pyista42: smarthost?
17:41  pipeline: Pyista42: most likely the ISPs mail server.
17:41  themill: !smarthost
17:41  dpkg: A smart host is a type of mail relay server (typically provided by your ISP), which allows an SMTP server to route e-mail to an intermediate mail server, rather than directly to the recipient's server.
17:41 --- tyebud_ is now known as tyebud
17:42  Pyista42: this is a dedicated server.....i dont think the isp provides this ....i have setup mail servers many of times
17:42  Pyista42: just was curious whats popular right now
17:43  stew: Pyista42: exim and postfix
17:44  Pyista42: a friend told me to use qmail once i forget why
17:44  stew: becuase he wants you to contribute to backscatter spam?
17:44  Pyista42: hmm? a bit confused
17:45  stew: Pyista42: nm, that's me being snarky,  the fact that its tough to make a qmail install not generate spam is the reason its currently not yet in debian (now that it is free, it was not free for a number of years, it became free when the author abandoned its development)
17:46  Pyista42: stew: exim and postfix it will be
17:47  Pyista42: i just like to check to see if anything new took the world by storm heh
17:47  pipeline: qmail is basically dead outside of very special purposes
17:47 --- dschoepe_ is now known as dschoepe
17:47  pipeline: postfix took the world by storm about ten years ago.  Steamroller won't quit.
17:47  pipeline: even redhat supports postfix now; there is no excuse for anyone to use sendmail anymore ;)
17:48  stew: though aiui, runing sendmail is much easier than it was the last time i had to admin it (which might have been 10 years ago)
17:50  Pyista42: how about for a client? support imap? whats best for this?
17:50  petemc: dovecot is very popular
17:51  Pyista42: thats what i was thinking of i kept thinking of some bird just couldn't remember it
17:52  eth01: hi. i am looking to copy a folder to a remote FTP server. whats the best way to do this?
17:54  stew: eth01: ncftpput? (it can do recursive with -R)
17:55  eth01: package to install stew?
17:55  Mowee: Hey ^^
17:55  stew: eth01: ncftp
18:08  fasta: !skype

18:08  eth01: stew, ncftpget keeps bringing up a help file ? how do i get past this page? it's like man
18:08  eth01: all i get is --more-- ?
18:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 942]
18:09  fasta: Is there any piece of software that actually works of those alternatives?
18:09  stew: eth01: what command are you running?
18:09  fasta: The last time I tried Ekiga it crashed. Anyway, I am looking for Skype for sid.
18:10  stew: fasta: you have to get it from skype themselves,  they don't allow anyone else to distribute their software
18:10  eth01: stew, ncftpput -u user -p password ftp.example.com
18:10  fasta: stew: but they only have lenny.
18:10  stalker37: hi all
18:10  stew: fasta: you'll have to ask them
18:10  themill: fasta: you still need to talk to them not us. The lenny version might work. Or it might not.
18:11  stew: eth01: you are missing the remote-directory, localfiles arguments (see man ncftpput)
18:11  stew: eth01: if you want something interactive, use ncftp instead of ncftpput
18:11  stalker37: who setup centos under debian xen domU?
18:12  stew: debian xen dom0?
18:12  aidan: Is there some trick I can use to run a binary on a remote server like it was on my own local server?
18:12  stew: aidan: what do you mean by "like it was on my local server"? do you mean local x server?
18:13  aidan: stew: no, I have a binary (tesseract) which took me 3 hours to compile on a remote FS ... I don't want to recompile on my local environment but I want to play with it while I test some stuff
18:14  stew: aidan: what do you mean by "like it was on my local server" ?
18:14  stew: aidan: how is that different than just running it on the remote server?
18:15  Bartzy: I have a 'sysstat' service... what is it ?
18:15  stew: Bartzy: apt-cache show sysstat
18:17  Bartzy: stew: Oh... it actually has a service ? :|
18:17  stalker37: uhuhu
18:17  stew: Bartzy: optionally
18:17  Bartzy: stew: What for ? sar monitoring ?
18:18  Bartzy: nm I undestood..
18:18  Bartzy: another question if I'm at it :p Where's the syslog conf file ? It doesn't have a daemon too ?
18:19  stew: Bartzy: it appears to run the sa1 script which has a manpage
18:19  stew: Bartzy: which syslog daemon do you use?
18:19  eth01: stew, ncftpput -u user1 -p password ftp.example.com /test1 /test2 -- should work ok?
18:19  Bartzy: stew: How can I check that ? The debian default I guess ?
18:19  aidan: stew: I want it to act on a local file, and spit the results to a local stdout
18:19  stew: eth01: without -R i don't know what that would do if /test2 is a directory
18:20  stew: Bartzy: aptitude search '~i~Psystem-log-daemon'
18:20  Bartzy: rsyslog.. is that ok ?
18:21  stew: Bartzy: its config is in /etc/rsyslog.conf yes, it has a daemon, /usr/sbin/rsyslogd (you could probably figure this out from "dpkg -L rsyslog")
18:22  stew: aidan: you could do this with ssh if the binary will work with stdin/stdout
18:22  Bartzy: I direct iptables logging to warning.. so it's probably kern.warn ? How can I redirect it to /var/log/firewall ?
18:23  fasta: How can I run xclock as a different user via ssh -X if I do have a root account, but I don't have the password of this different user?
18:23  fasta: I get X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.
18:23  blip2: fasta: sudo
18:23  blip2: ah yes
18:23  blip2: good question :P
18:24  fasta: I could change the password temporarily, of course, but that's cheating.
18:25  stew: fasta: install a authorized key?
18:26  fasta: stew: and then ssh to localhost (which is the remote host)?
18:26  fasta: stew: that could work, but I don't see why X doesn't 'just work'.
18:27  Bartzy: stew: Doing  kern.warning /var/log/firewall.log ,   kern.warning  ~   , *.* /var/log/messages should work ?
18:28  stew: fasta: if you want to get down and dirty with xauth to make it work, see /msg dpkg mit-magic-cookie
18:28  stuckey: If I want a drive to be mounted at login, what does the fstab entry need to look like? Will this do it: /dev/sdc1/mnt/western auto rw,user,auto 0 0
18:28  fasta: stew: I just want it to work for now and forever.
18:29 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 948]
18:29  fasta: stew: everytime I do something lilke this I have to reinvent the wheel.
18:29  stew: Bartzy: that would get ALL kernel warnings into that file,  if you want ONLY firewall warnings, have iptables use a different facility (like local1 or something)
18:29  fasta: Is there some huge design flaw in X or something like that?
18:29  fasta: I am root, what more right does it need?
18:29  fasta: rights*
18:29  Bartzy: stew: How do I do that ? :|
18:30  stew: fasta: when you run xclock as root it doesn't work?
18:30  Bartzy: stew: Also, the *.* /var/log/messages isn't too smart (I copied that from ServerFault) ?
18:30  stew: fasta: I thought the problem was with non-root?
18:30  fasta: stew: no, when I first su foobar and then run xclock.
18:30  fasta: stew: it should simply inherit the credentials.
18:30  fasta: stew: that seems a very basic security mechanism.
18:31  fasta: stew: Is something like that not possible?
18:32  stew: Bartzy: *shrug*, that would go in /var/log/syslog by default on debian (messages on redhat), its neither really smart or unsmart, but its a good idea to make sure no log messages are ever thrown away
18:32  themill: fasta: are you looking for sux? You can do this manually with xauth too.
18:32  stew: fasta: yes, not inheriting the credentials is a deliberate security mechanism
18:32  Bartzy: stew: I don't think it's possible to specify a logging facility for ip tables..
18:32  Bartzy: stew: So I'll just use kern.warning ?
18:32  stew: fasta: giving non-root users root credentials unintentinoally would be a security flaw
18:33  fasta: stew: it's not that a non-root user is given root credentials. It is someone who logged in as root who then went to a lower security level.
18:33  fasta: stew: so, it's still root.
18:33  eth01: stew, ncftpput /osticket: no valid files were specified. - -R is on the line
18:33  jhutchins_lt: Anybody know of a way to monitor or test a fax server?  I have one that has problems every couple of months or so and the client wants it to be "more reliable".
18:33  fasta: stew: it's a different environment, or at least it should be.
18:34  stew: fasta: yes, it is.  you want a non-root user to use root's credentials with the x server
18:34  Bushmills: fasta:   ssh -Y host ..
18:34  stew: fasta: and no, after su, its no longer root
18:34  fasta: themill: I think I used sux before and wasted hours on it, and in the end it still didn't work.
18:34 --- bzed_ is now known as bzed
18:35  fasta: stew: yes, I understand that it isn't. I am just saying that there should be a way in which that xclock can appear on my screen via a few indirections via ssh.
18:35  stew: fasta: ssh -X user@remotehost xclock
18:35  fasta: stew: but I don't have the user password.
18:36  stew: fasta: then user an ssh-key
18:36  fasta: stew: that means that for every user I want to ssh to I need to copy my key, that's just wasting diskspace.
18:36  fasta: stew: a small number, but it's a design failure.
18:37  stew: fasta: then use sux
18:37  fasta: stew: sux didn't work last time.
18:37  stew: fasta: or XAUTHORITY  environment varialbe
18:37  stew: fasta: or /msg dpkg mit-magic-cookie
18:37  stew: fasta: be more specific than "didn't work"
18:38  stew: fasta: is a couple hundred bytes of disk space per user really non-negligable?
18:38  fasta: stew: ok, I know it didn't work. Now it does work. Thanks. sux does work.
18:38  fasta: stew: imho, it's more about the general principle.
18:39  fasta: stew: a system can be designed elegantly or not. sux scales. Copying keys creates a maintainance hell.
18:39  Bushmills: ah, the principle of "it must work, even without researching the requirements or looking at the docs - otherwise i'll call it 'design flaw'"
18:39  stew: fasta: your reasoning about the general principle is contradictory.  you are saying "su isn't switching to a different user, its trying to lower privileges, but for some reason, i lose privileges after I do it"
18:40  fasta: Bushmills: again, sux didn't work last time.
18:40  stew: fasta: again, "didn't work" is useless to us
18:40 * Bushmills calls it "documentation retrieval and absorbion flaw"
