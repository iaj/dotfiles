16:08  iaj: lo there.. can I somehow find out which and how the memory banks are used without opening the machine?
16:09 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 923]
16:10  catsup: iaj: maybe in your bios, but probably not
16:10  nsadmin: opening the machine wouldn't help you with how memory is used
16:10  abrotman: !tell iaj about whats my hardware
16:10  iaj: well yeah.. there are currenlty 2GB of RAM inside, and I want to upgrade to 4GB of RAM, so now I have to find out if that's 1x2GB module - how many memory slots there are and which RAM it is...
16:11  nsadmin: unless you had an electron microscope, a lot of money, a steady hand and a knack for opening chips...
16:11  abrotman: iaj: IIRC dmidecode will tell you how many and which are used

16:16  rkhshm: i am trying to install a pkg to a fake dir using dpkg.. but get this error.. can anyone tell me what the problem is pls ?
16:17  Siegfried: i've installed all the necessary packages.. at least all the ones i see in apt

16:18  MrJK: hi!
16:19  rkhshm: any ideas guys ?
16:19  MrJK: I've some troubles with Synergy and my keyboard layout: I want azerty, but it still set as qwerty
16:20  MrJK: I'm with Squeeze, wmii ( I don't have the problem when it is the gnome session)
16:20  MrJK: So, I think I have to configure in my xorg.conf, but I don't know where to start... Do you have ideas, or how to fix my problem ?

16:24  Siegfried: abrotman, yes
16:25  Siegfried: abrotman, nevermind i understood, i ran "audacious"
16:25  Siegfried: which ran version 1... damn.. lost 20 minutes
16:25  abrotman: huh ?
16:25  abrotman: oh .. sorry
16:25  abrotman: though .. you shouldn't have the old one anymore

16:29  abrotman: MrJK: have you made it work without synergy yet?
16:30  MrJK: abrotman: with the 'local' keyboard, it works with the good layout
16:30  MrJK: ( that's a laptop)
16:30  MrJK: but, with synergy, that go back in QWERTY
16:30  abrotman: i would think that synergy would pick up your local settings and pass those on?
16:30  abrotman: (i know very little about synergy)
16:31  MrJK: All my computers uses AZERTY
16:31  MrJK: And, when I'm running the gnome env, no problems
16:31  MrJK: Maybe there is a link with gnome-setting-manager ?
16:32  MrJK: the daemon, or somthing like that ?
16:32  pipeline: I use xmodmap to alter my mouse settings with synergy... as long as I make my changes on the server and not the client, everything is great
16:32  pipeline: where did you configure your keyboard layout ?
16:32  Siegfried: in fact it's not version 1, it's a symlink, but for some reason i only launched it from nautilus and it ran audacious gtkui which had no "skin" option in the preferences.. anyway launching audacious2 manually fixed everything
16:33  abrotman: yay
16:33  MrJK: pipeline: hum, good question ... when I installed it ?
16:33  MrJK: I don't remember/know
16:34  pipeline: perhaps you configured both sides for azerty, and X11 is remapping your keyboard twice
16:34  pipeline: synergy is passing qwerty equivalents for azerty codes, and then your client is remapping the qwerty again
16:35  pipeline: I would try configuring the clients to use a standard qwerty keyboard
16:35  pipeline: and have azerty configured only on the synergy "server" side
16:35  MrJK: pipeline: hum, I think the problem is on the server
16:35  pipeline: I had that problem for a while with synergy -- I had my windows and solaris systems configured for lefthanded mouse, so my mouse buttons were remapped twice
16:36  MrJK: pipeline: maybe I don't know enough things on xorg, I don't understand the meaning of remapped (the context, etc) ... maybe there is a good documentation tointroduce me these notions ??
16:37  MrJK: good wiki to understand how works xorg ?
16:37  pipeline: beats me
16:38  pipeline: MrJK: as I understand synergy, it uses your present keyboard map on the server side to determine which keyboard codes to emit on the client side
16:38  pipeline: MrJK: if you configured your client to be AZERTY, I think you're gonna end up with the wrong things emitted
16:38  pipeline: MrJK: try configuring all synergy clients as QWERTY, see if your problem remains
16:39  MrJK: ok
16:40  MrJK: pipeline: okm that's work
16:40  MrJK: hum
16:40  MrJK: when my client is in QWERTY
16:40  MrJK: that's wird
16:41  MrJK: so, how can I fix that, that really uncomfortable to change kb layout each time i change computer

16:46  badcloud: *missing
16:47  pipeline: MrJK: synergy is not intended for you to change back and forth who is client and who is server
16:48  pipeline: MrJK: it's intended for e.g. corporate desktops, where you're gonna have UNIX and Windows side by side in a pretty much fixed configuration :\
16:48  StucKman: I'm using, among other things, extlinux (a sibling of syslinux) to make a disk image bootable. this used to work until a few weeks ago (I could make the disk image boot in, say, qemu), but now it doesn't and I ahven't the slightest idea why. the script I use hasn't changed (I have it in a mercurial repo, so I can tell). this is debian unstable. any ideas?
16:48  abrotman: pipeline: one of his clients is a laptop .. i'd imagine he'd like to be able to carry it somewhere and not have to change the kb layout
16:48  pipeline: eh my laptop is my synergy server
16:49  pipeline: for that very reason

16:58  Lantizia: hey I've got the source files I want to package up extracted with my debian directory inside it... trying to run dpkg-buildpackage
16:58  Lantizia: and it moans there is no orig.tar file found
16:58  Lantizia: but it shouldn't need it since the source files are there!
16:59  nsadmin: needs that for other reasons, for example to see whether to generate a diff or not
16:59 --- Guest9984 is now known as nuke-
16:59  Lantizia: nsadmin: in the same dir or the dir below?
17:00 --- nuke- is now known as nuke`
17:00  nsadmin: you're just trying to build a package right?
17:00  nsadmin: try this...
17:00  nsadmin: fakeroot debian/rules clean
17:00  nsadmin: fakeroot debian/rules build
17:00  nsadmin: fakeroot debian/rules binary
17:01  nsadmin: then look in ..
17:02  Lantizia: it's ok it's compiling now
17:03  nsadmin: I guess the whole dpkg-buildpackage thing is preparing an upload
17:04  Lantizia: I've got the asterisk tar.gz from digium renamed to orig.tar.gz... I've got the debian directory from voip-pkg debian team but tweaked... and now it's compiling
17:05  Lantizia: i just think it's odd I need asterisk-1.8.0-orig.tar.gz AND it extracted to asterisk-1.8.0 and then the debian dir inside that
17:05  themill: Lantizia: you don't actually need the extracted upstream source at all.
17:05  Lantizia: themill: just make an empty dir the same as the source name and stick the debian dir inside that?
17:06  Lantizia: this is quilt btw
17:08  themill: Lantizia: you need the unpacked source for making the patches, not for building the package. If you want to not have that, there are tools around to help you, but you sounded like you didn't want to learn more tools right now. (You're asking dpkg-buildpackage to build your source package and then the binary packages. To build the source package it has to know how you changed things which, given you are working in the unpacked sources, requires you to
17:08  themill: also have the orig.tar.gz around)

17:09  zxd: where is stunnel chnnael
17:09  Lantizia: themill: well I the patches go in debian/patches
17:10  themill: Lantizia: how are the tools to know that?
17:10  Lantizia: rules
17:11  Lantizia: again this is source version 3.0 not 2.0
17:11  themill: there's no way dpkg-source can know that's the only files you changed.
17:11  Lantizia: i haven't ran that
17:11  themill: dpkg-buildpackage does for you. It has a good man page that describes what it does.
17:12  Lantizia: All I want is a) the original source tarball and b) the debian directory ... and to know what is supposed to be where (present directory, forward a directory, back a directory)
17:12  Lantizia: and it should be able to build both source and binary packages from that
17:13  Lantizia: all the information is needs is in the debian directory
17:13  Lantizia: *it
17:13  themill: Lantizia: git-buildpackage + pristine-tar can do this for you.
17:13  themill: Lantizia: and all the information is not *necessarily* in the debian directory for this process.
17:13  Lantizia: I don't even know the proper way dpkg-buildpackage wants it... it seems like trial and error
17:14  themill: Lantizia: This is well covered in the new maintainer's guide and in the dpkg-buildpackge manual. Your personal approach may be trial and error but that is something that I gave up trying to influence some time ago.
17:15  Lantizia: themill: well the nmg is referencing dpkg-buildpackage nothing more so that is what I'm sticking to
17:15  Lantizia: but the nmg is a half hearted windbag of a manual anyway
17:15  themill: patches welcome.
17:16  Seb: Lantizia: so you're not only being an ass in #untangle, then; that certainly warms my heart
17:16  Lantizia: Seb: lol I gave up on untangle looong ago, it can't even do proper nat reflection
17:17  Lantizia: Seb: vyatta see your product as a joke when I brought that one up

17:17  pipeline: guys what do I do they're not being nice to me on irc
17:18  Lantizia: whats a high touch?
17:18  Lantizia: :D
17:18  pipeline: the hand-holding that you presently seem to expect
17:18  Lantizia: I'm just after clarification because the manual isn't clear
17:18  Lantizia: not to mention considerable parts are not updated to quilt
17:19  Seb: Lantizia: to be honest, nothing's ever clear to you unless some poor soul does the deed for you
17:19  Lantizia: Seb: your opinion :)
17:20  pipeline: Seb, Lantizia : Yes that would be "high touch" support
17:20  Seb: pipeline: oh I gotcha you the 1st time ;)
17:20  Lantizia: sounds rude lol
17:20  pipeline: Lantizia: the only rude part is what you typically have to pay a vendor to get the level of support you have received in IRC
17:21  themill: Lantizia: perhaps you should read the maint-guide more carefully. It does talk about the use of quilt and it also talks about the use of git-buildpackage. But this discussion is going no-where. There's plenty of excellent information there, in man dpkg-buildpackage and on the debian and ubuntu wikis.
17:21  Seb: man pages ? Sheesh, man

18:37  compaq: How do you get aptitude to remove all dependencies too, cause in the text gui, everytime I hit - and then g, it says, Some packages were broken and now have been fixed, and then Keep the package or upgrade or downgrade, instead of the desired remove
18:37  JordiGH: dutchfish: I thought it was stock Debian...
18:38  JordiGH: I have a lot of older kernels lying around, though.
18:38  dutchfish: JordiGH: well since you are on 5.0 and using a kernel form testing make sure it does
18:38  dutchfish: JordiGH: and if it is up to date
18:39  dutchfish: judd kernel
18:39  judd: Available kernel versions are: experimental: 2.6.36-trunk-686 (2.6.36-1~experimental.1); sid: 2.6.32-5-686 (2.6.32-27); squeeze: 2.6.32-5-686 (2.6.32-27); lenny-backports: 2.6.32-bpo.5-686 (2.6.32-26~bpo50+1); lenny: 2.6.26-2-686 (2.6.26-25lenny1); etchnhalf: 2.6.24-etchnhalf.1-686 (2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.9etch3); etch: 2.6.18-6-686 (2.6.18.dfsg.1-26etch2)
18:40  compaq: thanks stew, it finally gone
18:41  JordiGH: dutchfish: Yeah, I got 2.6.3-27
18:41  JordiGH: From the OSUOSL mirror.
18:42  eshat: I have problems with the offical previev of flash for amd64, so I wanted to use nspluginwrapper
18:42  dutchfish: JordiGH: not that it helps much, but is this arch x86_64 or i386?
18:42  eshat: but I get: nspluginwrapper: no appropriate viewer found for libflashplayer.so
18:43  JordiGH: dutchfish: x86_64
18:44  dutchfish: JordiGH: i think the best thing to do (if this is not a production machine0 to dist-upgrade to squeeze and look if this is also relevant on squeeze, but only if you are sure nothing else has been hosed up.
18:44  JordiGH: I think I am on squeeze.
