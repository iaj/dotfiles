09:03  iaj: how could I find out about system specs when Im only logged in via ssh to a debian machine?
09:04  rahsputin: system specs are ?
09:04  Xinux: iaj, "lspci -vv" and "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
09:05  rahsputin: hwinfo
09:08  iaj: thanks dudes.. specially need to find out about processor and memory.

09:09  chicognu: Those packages are automated installed and are not more need. run apt-get autoremove to remove they ... apt-get autoremove Where is my gnome now ?
09:10  chicognu: It happens with anyone here ?
09:12  Xinux: Anyone have any ideas how to autologin? I don't have any sort of gui ;P
09:14  chicognu: Xinux, autologin in console ?
09:14  Xinux: chicognu, correct
09:16  chicognu: searching
09:16  chicognu: ..
09:17  chicognu: Xinux, do you already try it ? http://www.debianadmin.com/how-to-auto-login-and-startx-without-a-display-manager-in-debian.html
09:21  cryptr: Xinux: quite easy, replace the login in /etc/inittab for that tty
09:22  cryptr: 1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
09:22  cryptr: that line
09:22  cryptr: could ne /bin/bash whatever or a script that su's a user, i've done several different ones
09:23  Xinux: aye i have another question, i got it to autologin
09:23  Xinux: but where is the bash profile?
09:23  Xinux: is it included in a command line install?
09:23  cryptr: bash -s
09:23  cryptr: err
09:23  cryptr: -l
09:23  cryptr: then it reads /etc/profile
09:24  cryptr: orr bash.bashrc
09:24  cryptr: whatever it is called nowdays :)
09:24  Xinux: i got nothing
09:24  Xinux: ;O
09:24  cryptr: bash uses .profile to load .bashrc and also reads /etc/bash.bashrc
09:24  cryptr: upon login
09:27  linis: in vim how can i search a pattern and then save all the returned pattern's line into a different file ??
09:27  cryptr: dont use vim
09:28  cryptr: use grep? or sed?
09:28  cryptr: cat file | grep pattern > search_findings
09:28  jelly-hme: !uuoc cryptr
09:28 * dpkg hands cryptr the "useless use of cat" award
09:29  cryptr: yay
09:29  cryptr: grep pattern file > search_findings
09:29  cryptr: better?
09:29  jelly-hme: those awards are handy as doorstops, I have a couple
09:29  cryptr: useless no, uberobvious yes.
09:30  cryptr: or over simplified as hell :)
09:30  cryptr: yeah i agree useless.
09:30  jelly-hme: needless might be a more pedantic term but "UUOC" is customary
09:31  cryptr: i bow to thee :)
09:31  linis: cryptr: awesome! thanks dude ;)
09:32  iaj: hmmm.. how an I find out about how much memory is installed on a debian machine??
09:33  cryptr: free
09:33  cryptr: dmesg | grep Mem
09:34  cryptr: cat /proc/meminfo
09:34  cryptr: another UUOC!
09:35  cryptr: This is good
09:35  cryptr: $ grep MemTotal /proc/meminfo
09:35  cryptr: MemTotal:        3890636 kB
09:35  iaj: MemTotal:      2075080 kB   - so theres only 2 gig installed here?
09:35  cryptr: aye
09:35  cryptr: if there was more the system would report more even if not a amd64 kernel
09:35  iaj: thanks a lot cryptr 
09:35  cryptr: for 32bit 3.8 gb or so is max
09:35  cryptr: np
09:36  cryptr: free is a very good linux command if you have not tested it before.
09:36  cryptr: shows you a little bit less info the /proc/meminfo but it is more readable
09:36  cryptr: also less confusing compared to top

10:01  d5e: edit /etc/X11/xporg.conf
10:01  d5e: xorg.conf
10:07  cryptr: if you have no /etc/X11/xorg.conf (autodetect in xorg nowdays) do Xorg -configure and then copy the file created into /etc/X11/

10:20  harold: Why does my screen go blank every 15-30mins? According to xset q, DPSM is disabled and timeout=0...
10:20  CutMeOwnThroat: I think it might be, what we geeks technically call a "screensaver"
10:21  harold: CutMeOwnThroat: Why? timeout is already 0. Shouldn't that disabled it?
10:22  chicognu: I`am trying to configure 3d support in lenny, withou sucess. i have a core i3 processor, any one can help me please
10:22  CutMeOwnThroat: oh, didn't see the 2nd line :) but might be some separate program?
10:23  CutMeOwnThroat: harold, gnome has its own screen saver ...
10:23  harold: Hmm, pretty sure I'm using XFCE
10:23  CutMeOwnThroat: "ps aux |grep scree" might provide a clue
10:24  harold: Oh, no I'm using gnome atm.
10:24  paradigm: chicognu: is the Core i3 one of intel's processors with the built-in graphics?  Or is it Intel graphics on the motherboard?  Or do you have separate graphics from AMD or nVidia?
10:24  CutMeOwnThroat: xfce probably also has a screensaver... most DE will have it
10:24  iaj: hi there- currenlty got etch running - is there a safe and easy way to upgrade to latest?
10:25  cryptr: apt-get update
10:25  cryptr: apt-get dist-ugprade
10:25  CutMeOwnThroat: iaj, /msg dpkg etch->lenny
10:25  cryptr: after changing etch -> lenny in /etc/apt/sources.list
10:25  cryptr: then hope all works :)
10:25  CutMeOwnThroat: iaj, or just read the topic, which says the same
10:25  iaj: cryptr: how long might that ake?
10:25  chicognu: paradigm, builtin grafics
10:25  iaj: take... ?
10:26  ethanol: mornin' all!
10:26  cryptr: iaj: depends on your machine and your internet
10:26  cryptr: morning eth
10:26  paradigm: chicognu: I suspect the problem is your computer is newer then Lenny, and so Lenny doesn't come with the drivers for it (yet).  You can try getting a newer kernel from Debian backports, which will likely have the drivers necessary.
10:27  chicognu: paradigm, I compiled the new stable kernel already, the 2.6.36...
10:27  paradigm: oh
10:28  paradigm: yeah then I've got no idea
10:28  cryptr: iaj: i would guess 15-20min on a server that is intel p3 or p4 if it is a desktop then loads more depending on how much you have installed
10:28  chicognu: paradigm,  :(
10:28  CutMeOwnThroat: iaj, hard to say, with an ok connection, perhaps 2-3h + problems? Also depends on the amount of packages you have installed, no? big spread there - amount of problems can also vary widely and will be able to take up a lot of time if it happens....
10:28  paradigm: chicognu: maybe you need a newer X as well?  Have you tried squeeze or another distro?
10:28  cryptr: iaj: there might be some things you have to consider though so check the tipuc /msg dpkg etch->lenny
10:28  cryptr: iaj: been a while since I moved on from etch
10:28  cryptr: iaj: but I did just that on a server and it went fine
10:29 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 779]
10:29  CutMeOwnThroat: but I always leave it running in the background and only check back occasionally for questions, that tends to delay the process :)
10:29  iaj: cryptr: thanks a lot... :-)
10:29  chicognu: paradigm,  I think it is some configuration in xorg.conf, the corg.conf is using vesa, I don`t know what drive to put there. I use ubuntu 10.4 LTS Desktop, and 3d works fine on it
10:29  cryptr: CutMeOwnThroat: true, same here, like days :)
10:30  gusnan: chicognu, I thought you said Lenny?
10:30  chicognu: gusnan, yes
10:31  paradigm: chicognu: in my experiences, with Lenny and onwards, you don't really need to mess with the xorg.conf.  So long as the kernel has the drivers and the xorg is new enough it ``just works''.
10:31  chicognu: gusnan, I`m using Debian Lenny
10:31  gusnan: ah, I misread.
10:31  cryptr: paradigm: agreeed on that
10:31  harold: CutMeOwnThroat: So yeah, apparently the gnome screen saver and power down settings are enabled.
10:31  harold: CutMeOwnThroat: But why oh why does gnome not respect the xset values?
10:31  cryptr: because it is gnome :)
10:31  chicognu: gusnan, or I misstype, english is not my native language :)
10:31  cryptr: gnomes do not trust others
10:32  iaj: cryptr: all the cron jobs and stuff should still be there... if everything goes smoothly - correct?
10:32  iaj: :D
10:32  cryptr: chicognu: you did state you use ubuntu 10.4
10:32  cryptr: iaj: _IF_ everything goes smooth..
10:32  cryptr: iaj: double check double check backup /etc first
10:33  chicognu: i used, I tested... In the past  :)
10:33  chicognu: sorry
10:33  chicognu: :)
10:33  cryptr: iaj: I know there is an issue with named going ethc - > lenny
10:33  iaj: cryptr: mhhh alright - thanks :-)
10:33  cryptr: iaj: if it is a DNS server you have to read up on that
10:33  cryptr: iaj: because clients wont be able to query it without conf modifications
10:34  cryptr: iaj:  I ran into that myself
10:34  gusnan: chicognu, your goal should be newer versions of xserver-xorg-video-intel - I don't know how easy that is to do on Lenny though...
10:34  chicognu: paradigm, it is hard to compile xorg ? do you think I need to install some package ?
10:34  cryptr: chicognu: go squeeze instead and check that first
10:34  nsadmin: the real deal is this... if you get an answer that's supposed to be for lenny, you apply it to anything at your own risk :) as long as you're ok with that, go ahead on
10:35  iaj: cryptr: hm we just got a mysql db running on that server... performing php scripts and so on - that shouldn't be a problem at all, correct?
10:35  chicognu: gusnan, humm... it is a question about install a package or I need compile ?
10:35  chicognu: cryptr, you mean, a distro upgrade ?
10:35  cryptr: iaj: you will go from php4 to php5 i think
10:35  chicognu: or just add some reposytores ?
10:35  cryptr: iaj: as long as that works for your scripts i think you will be ok, I do not remember any mysql problems
10:35  paradigm: chicognu: I don't remember ever trying to compile xorg, but I dno't think it'd be to terribly hard if you're used to compiling other things.  Grab build-essential and whatever libraries it asks for.  Although I feel you should first try Debian Squeeze - it's almost released.  Good chance it'll work there.
10:35  cryptr: chicognu: switch disto
10:35  iaj: cryptr: can there be some trouble?
10:36  cryptr: iaj: depends on how you coded things, globals enabled?
10:36  cryptr: iaj: pretty sure many global things are deprecated in php5 and might be disabled
10:36  nsadmin: chicognu: what's the problem with xorg in lenny?
10:37  cryptr: iaj: I would do this, install lenny in a qemu/virtualbox or something, test your php and mysql there first
10:37  cryptr: iaj: before upgrading
10:37  paradigm: iaj: i concure with cryptr
10:37  cryptr: iaj: that way you are atleast prepared for any php/mysql errors
10:38  chicognu: nsadmin, I don`t think there is any problem with xorg in lenny. I`m trying to install 3D suport for a I3 core with integrated graphics card, with out success
10:38  iaj: hmmm... yeah.. but that's a large step to take
10:38  iaj: paradigm: huh?
10:38  nsadmin: if php-5.x is totally incompatible with php-5.(x+1), that makes php fairly unstable overall
10:38  cryptr: iaj: concure = agrees :)
10:38  paradigm: iaj: I'd also recommend, as cryptr did, that you try it out in a VM b efore doing so on your actual box
10:39  nsadmin: chicognu: this video is now in the computer with the lenny?
10:39  iaj: oops... sorry... :-)
10:39  paradigm: not a problem
10:39  cryptr: not that I remember 100% correct but etch was php4 right?
10:39  paradigm: Rooms like this are international, I need to be careful about my word choice
10:40  chicognu: nsadmin, you mean, if the video card is right now with the computer with lenny ? if so, yes, it is!
10:40  nsadmin: ok, lspci -nn
10:40  iaj: i more or less found a - opposite - translation based on my german knowledge :)
10:40  nsadmin: and look for the text line that describes this video
10:40  nsadmin: show just that one line here
10:41  chicognu: paradigm, the xorg --configure in general way should genarate a file with the correct drive, if it is avible, right
10:41  chicognu: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Device 0046 (rev 12) nsadmin
10:41  nsadmin: lspci -nn
10:41  chicognu: sorry
10:41  nsadmin: don't forget the -nn :)
10:41  paradigm: chicognu: yes, I believe so
10:42  nsadmin: try again :)
10:42  nsadmin: with -nn that is
10:42  chicognu: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Device [8086:0046] (rev 12)
10:42  nsadmin: judd, pciid 8086:0046
10:43  judd: [8086:0046] is 'Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller' from 'Intel Corporation' with no known kernel module in lenny but has kernel module 'i915' in sid. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=8086:0046
10:43  chicognu: cool
10:44  chicognu: judd, pciid 197b:2383
10:44  judd: [197b:2383] is 'MS Host Controller' from 'JMicron Technology Corp.' with kernel modules 'jmb38x_ms', 'jmicron', 'ahci' in lenny. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=197b:2383
10:44  Steppenwolf: anyone awake?
10:44  chicognu: judd, pciid 197b:0250
10:44  nsadmin: it's all part of the dream, dream, dream...
10:44  judd: [197b:0250] is 'JMC250 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller' from 'JMicron Technology Corp.' with kernel modules 'jmicron', 'ahci' in lenny. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=197b:0250
10:45  chicognu: wow, judd lie hard
10:45  chicognu: this module if is in lenny, the system don`t reconize, or install it
10:46  nsadmin: what's your uname -r?
10:46  Steppenwolf: which of the rc?.d scripts dictate the startup on standard debian, anyone know?
10:46  chicognu: know is 2.6.36, I upgrade the kernel most because that module nsadmin
10:47  cryptr: Steppenwolf: rc2.d is default runlevel
10:47  Steppenwolf: thanks!
10:47  nsadmin: Steppenwolf: see /etc/inittab
10:47  cryptr: Steppenwolf: but depending on lenny or squeeze it is different on how things in /etc/init.d are loaded
10:48  chicognu: nsadmin, any ideia about how to setup the 3D support here with out change the version of my distro ?
10:48  nsadmin: does squeeze have upstart well integrated now?
10:48  nsadmin: that kernel you have, you built it yourself?
10:48  chicognu: yes
10:48  paradigm: chicognu: you sure you got the proper stuff in the driver?
10:48  paradigm: for the new card?
10:49  nsadmin: you might have to either rebuild or build the i915 module
10:49  vtts: Steppenwolf, rcS.d, then rc2.d
10:49  CutMeOwnThroat: this sounds a bit like a stupid question.. but for two separate problems preventing the same program from starting, I would file two separate bugs, right?
10:49  panosru: Hello, could anyone provide me any guide on how to setup an external mail server ?
10:50  nsadmin: external?
10:50  nsadmin: external to what?
10:50  chicognu: paradigm, in kernel config ? sure,  sure, I don`t have ... I look the device support, the video card, and select all intel* as module...
10:50  chicognu: nsadmin, in kernel ?
10:50  nsadmin: chicognu, did you use make-kpkg?
10:50  cryptr: panosru: I believe it is far easier for you to google that
10:50  chicognu: nsadmin, no
10:50  cryptr: panosru: and try some first
10:51  cryptr: panosru: then come back if you have questions, I would suggest postfix though
10:51  paradigm: CutMeOwnThroat: I don't know for sure, but that's what I would expect
10:51  cryptr: panosru: I find that the easiest and most stable way (my own opinion though)
10:52  petan: is it possible to upgrade some packages from sid and keep them?
10:52  panosru: cryptr: I tried to google "debian use osx mailserver", or "debian setup external mail server" and things like that I jus though that if I asked here maybe someone already done it before and could provide me guide :)
10:52  petan: like to upgrade something and switch back to stable lenny
10:52  nsadmin: chicognu: you -might- try building again using it; it's in the package kernel-package
10:52  panosru: I use debian as a virtual machine for my development environment (as a web server) in my OSX machine
10:52  cryptr: petan: that would be unwise Id say
10:52  petan: cryptr: what would happen? why do you think that
10:52  panosru: and I have setup a mail server in my osx which works great for local testings and things like that
10:52  CutMeOwnThroat: paradigm, right...
10:52  cryptr: panosru: aha you mean external smtp or so?
10:53  chicognu: nsadmin, paradigm wow, one seond pleas .. I just run modprob i915, and there is a module with that name
10:53  nsadmin: petan: sid is based on newer libs, which could damage something earlier (like lenny or squeeze)
10:53  cryptr: petan: most likely you would have a broken system, first it would most likely upgrade all base to sid
10:53  panosru: cryptr: yeah
10:53  iaj: whats the apt- command for showing package information? like which php version is currently installed?
10:53  paradigm: iaj: apt-cache show $packagename
10:54  cryptr: panosru: you want your vbox to send emails via the host OSC?
10:54  cryptr: OSX..
10:54  nsadmin: chicognu, ok, suggest you restart x and then try glxgears
10:54  petan: why newer libs does not work with older software? that does not make sense.
10:54  panosru: cryptr: yes exactly
10:54  cryptr: panosru: and you know that the OSX mailserver works as a relay? smtp?
10:55  chicognu: nsadmin, my xorg.conf still with vesa in drive section, I need to change it before
10:55  chicognu: ?
10:55  nsadmin: it's not just the libs, it's that the packaging of the newer libs will cause some of your installed packages to be removed and/or replaced by newer
10:56  chicognu: 4701 frames in 5.0 seconds = 938.435 FPS nsadmin it looks like 3d acelaration is actived ?
10:56  nsadmin: hmm, that looks good
10:56  panosru: cryptr: I think it works as smtp
10:56  nsadmin: look over output of glxinfo
10:57  nsadmin: (so now you should arrange for module i915 to be loaded at boot)
10:57  iaj: paradigm: thanks so if do a apt-cache show php5  and get information - theres php5 installed here?
10:57  nsadmin: try something 3d :)
10:57  nsadmin: got doom4?
10:58  chicognu: direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose) nsadmin
10:58  panosru: cryptr: ok I got it working :P
10:58  chicognu: nsadmin, planet penguin race ... too slow
10:58  cryptr: panosru: install exim4 then confgiureit as a smarthost and point it to the IP of your host OSX, you might have to setup a host-only network in virtualbox for the guest to be able to speak to the host directly
10:58  nsadmin: hmm. that's not so good, but it does look like you're on your way
11:00  chicognu: nsadmin, wait, I will close xorg
11:00  cryptr: iaj: nope, you use dpkg -l | grep php5 to see local stuff
11:00  cryptr: iaj: apt-cache show checks the apt-database you update with apt-get update
11:01  tarzeau: ~/KDE/Share/Apps/Clipper what's that good for?
11:03  chicognu: in the xorg configuration file I change the vesa driver for i915, but there is no such module
11:03  chicognu: nsadmin,
11:04  nsadmin: could you repost that pciid

11:13  cryptr: chicognu: aye the intel driver is called "intel"
11:13  CutMeOwnThroat: feel free to do so
11:13  nsadmin: what package for the intel xorg driver?
11:14  cryptr: chicognu: ls /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/
11:14  chicognu: nsadmin, I think it is  xserver-xorg-video-intel
11:14  cryptr: chicognu: what do you have there
11:14  nsadmin: chicognu, try installing that :)
11:15  cryptr: chicognu: did you check what files you have in /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/
11:15  chicognu: http://pastebin.com/f1gxGU1S cryptr
11:16  chicognu: nsadmin, it is already installed
11:16  cryptr: i see intel
11:16  cryptr: intel_drv.so
11:16  nsadmin: meetoo
11:16  cryptr: so you have it
11:16  cryptr: xorg conf should say Driver "intel"
11:16  nsadmin: try this...
11:19  iaj: cryptr: ahh thanks.. so if it says php5-common in my dpkg -l - do I have php5 installed :)?  I can't run php -version because I don't have the root pass yet.

11:23  BlackFate: no
11:24  jelly: djszapi: no, but you can set up a post-install hook to wipe all the files
11:24  CutMeOwnThroat: themill, feel like doing "apt-get install mgltools-pmv idle-python2.6 python-imaging-tk" on squeeze and telling me if it works for them?
11:24  chicognu: nsadmin, here it is http://pastebin.com/McyeSDRh
11:24 --- Channel #debian was synced in 154 seconds
11:25  nsadmin: how's glxgears running now? is it still not working?
11:25  djszapi: jelly: I mean in a ready-made package...
11:25  djszapi: when I would like to install it.
11:25  jelly: djszapi: that applies to all the packages
11:25  djszapi: exactly, dpkg feature...
11:25  nsadmin: your post install hook could archive the docs
11:26  jelly: djszapi: not a dpkg feature, an apt feature
11:26  djszapi: does not really matter.
11:26  djszapi: whatever.
11:26  djszapi: can I install a debian package with dpkg without the documentation in the data.tar.gz ?
11:27  chicognu: nsadmin, glxgears ways work 4580 frames in 5.0 seconds = 914.356 FPS ...
11:27  nsadmin: that's similar to the performance before, right?
11:27  jelly: djszapi: this is what eg. debsums package does, you can put something similar in /etc/apt/apt.conf or a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/: DPkg::Post-Invoke { "if [ -x /usr/bin/debsums ]; then /usr/bin/debsums --generate=nocheck -sp /var/cache/apt/archives; fi"; };
11:27  chicognu: nsadmin, but no dri, and no true 3d suport
11:27  chicognu: nsadmin, yes
11:27  chicognu: nsadmin, and the driver ~intel~ dont work
11:27  nsadmin: ok, look over that log
11:28  jelly: djszapi: you could enumerate and wipe all the files under those directories
11:28  nsadmin: I wonder if it's an issue about compatibility between the version of intel_drv.so and the kernel version (and version of the i915 module)
11:29 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 794]
11:29  iaj: cryptr: so if it says php5-common in my dpkg -l - do I have php5 installed :)?  I can't run php -version because I don't have the root pass yet.
11:29  iaj: sorry got a disc :\
11:29  nsadmin: chicognu, look at the Xorg log you pastebinned earlier, see if that's informative
11:30  cryptr: iaj: just php5-common? thats not enough
11:30  nsadmin: notice that the kernel is somehow involved here... so incompatibility could exist
11:30  chicognu: nsadmin, that log to me is more like read Cirillo
11:30  jelly: djszapi: man apt.conf has some details about Post-Invoke (not much though, you'll have to read apt docs)
11:30  iaj: cryptr: theres nothing else about php :\
11:30  cryptr: iaj: should have some apache module ex: libapache2-mod-php5
11:31  nsadmin: well you've done good up to this point...
11:31  cryptr: iaj: are you on the etch box now? or in a lenny?
11:31  nsadmin: grep -n for EE
11:32  iaj: cryptr: I'm on the etch box
11:32  iaj: cryptr: libapache2-mod-php5 is installed as well..sorry
11:32  cryptr: iaj: then you ahave php5 atleast
11:32  cryptr: iaj: could you do a cat /etc/debian_version
11:32  cryptr: iaj: and post that
11:32  iaj: so I shouldn't be frightened about the GLOBALS problem?
11:33  nsadmin: there are no errors (EE) and 12 warnings
11:33  cryptr: iaj: you could still have register_globals on in your /etc/php5/apache configs
11:33  iaj: cryptr: 4.0 it gives.
11:33  cryptr: oki
11:34  chicognu: nsadmin, but that log is the last created log, right ?
11:34  nsadmin: that log is written again every time you start x
11:34  cryptr: iaj: i think that register_globals has been default off ofr a while so you might be safe
11:34  iaj: cryptr: register_globals=off it tells
11:35  cryptr: iaj:good
11:35  cryptr: iaj: then you do not have to worry about that atleast
11:35  chicognu: nsadmin, iam not with intel driver in xorg, i put intel drive in xorg, and close X, but it don`t start again, saying there is no intel driver, so I change intel to VESA and restart X
11:35  iaj: cryptr: hehe :) alright, thanks a lot mate
11:35  cryptr: iaj: and if you use nothing else then mysql and php you should be ok do upgrade
11:35  chicognu: nsadmin, With intel in driver section X dont start
11:35  nsadmin: oh, so intel still doesn't work?
11:35  cryptr: iaj: but do it during non office hourse :)
11:35  chicognu: no, it never work
11:35  cryptr: hours...
11:35  iaj: cryptr: one other thing, where is php usually located?
11:36  nsadmin: ok, then do this... (wait till I'm done tho)
11:36  cryptr: iaj: cli or the module?
11:36  iaj: cli... and the module as well, heh:)
11:36  cryptr: cli in /usr/bin
11:36  cryptr: module in usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so
11:36  nsadmin: stop X, replace config so it's intel, start x again (use just X) and let it die
11:37  nsadmin: then copy the log file so it doesn't overwrite it
11:37  serard: hello
11:37  nsadmin: then reset the config so X will start so you can come here
11:37  cryptr: iaj: for binaries you can always do which <binary> to see where it exists
11:37  nsadmin: then pastebin the copy
11:38  nsadmin: chicognu: got all that?
11:38  chicognu: nsadmin,  and how I will put the log in past bin if the X will not start
11:38  nsadmin: copy the log file before starting x with working config
11:39  chicognu: nsadmin, where is the log ?
11:39  chicognu: again, please
11:39  djszapi: jelly: mmh
11:39  nsadmin: it's /var/log/Xorg.0.log
11:39  nsadmin: so copy that file to (hmm, where... hmm...) your home dir
11:40  nsadmin: after you try to do X with the currently bad config
11:40  djszapi: jelly: how can I enumerate and wipe ?
11:40  chicognu: closing X again
11:41  jelly: djszapi: dunno, using find and rm?
11:41  jelly: or whatever you like
11:42  cryptr: mkfs.ext3 /dev/hd && directories
11:42  cryptr: but that's just evil
11:42  djszapi: jelly: I think I misses the basic knowledge about that.
11:42  djszapi: can you give me a package and example where it works, even a simple package ?
11:43  cryptr: djszapi: you do not want any docs or mans?
11:43  nsadmin: the docs are not divided into a separate package
11:43  cryptr: djszapi: rm -fr /usr/share/doc/packagename
11:43  cryptr: manfiles, a bit harder
11:43  jelly: djszapi: sorry, that would require me to do all the footwork instead of you, and I'm not doing that for free
11:44  nsadmin: chicognu, maybe now we can tell what's going on
11:44  cryptr: djszapi: curious, why do you not want the docs and mans?
11:44  themill: CutMeOwnThroat: no problems doing that at all
11:44  jelly: cryptr: well, the policy only says you're safe to delete files in doc/packagename/, not the directories.
11:44  djszapi: cryptr: because that is sometimes very large on embedded systems, just check Nokia phones out.
11:44  nsadmin: he's got one of those really old drives that only store two bytes
11:45  cryptr: djszapi: ahh not man though? docs yeah
11:45  chicognu: http://pastebin.com/NwC9zJSQ nsadmin  cryptr
11:45  djszapi: both I would like to avoid.
11:45  cryptr: djszapi: then as jelly say delete /usr/share/doc/<packaname>/*
11:46  jelly: cryptr: I didn't say that.  I said "remove files only", and that command might not.
11:46  nsadmin: line 297
11:46  cryptr: chicognu: sadly that driver most likely dont support your new i3 chip
11:47  nsadmin: so it looks like you were right in the first place, that you needed a newer intel driver
11:47  djszapi: cryptr: DPkg::Post-Invoke { "if [ -x /usr/bin/debsums ]; then /usr/bin/debsums --generate=nocheck -sp /var/cache/apt/archives; fi"; rm -rf /usr/share/doc/<packaname>/*} ?
11:47  cryptr: squeeze supports a few more
11:47  jelly: cryptr, djszapi: that bit would be more like find /usr/share/doc/packagename -type f -delete.   But you still have to figure out which package got installed, and for that you need to use the "version 2 protocol" between apt and dpkg that man apt.conf writes about
11:47  djszapi: in a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99test file ?
11:47  chicognu: cryptr, nsadmin so, compiling new xorg
11:48  cryptr: chicognu: or try new x driver
11:48  djszapi: jelly: would not it be a better design to implement a dpkg feature for this purpose ?
11:48  chicognu: cryptr, how
11:48  jelly: djszapi: no
11:48  djszapi: another option, for example.
11:48  cryptr: chicognu: http://intellinuxgraphics.org/
11:48  cryptr: chicognu: demands a few compiles anyway
11:48  jelly: djszapi: I mean, sure, go ahead and implement it
11:48  djszapi: jelly: I can give it a try, but is there any chance it will be accepted ?
11:49  chicognu: cryptr,  it is a trusted source of files ?
11:49  themill: djszapi: feel free to send patches -- the embedded people might be interested in them, but I doubt it. They've gone down the path or reworking the debs themselves to remove the documentation.
11:49  cryptr: djszapi: I do not think the general debian distribution is ment for nokia phones or anything similar.
11:49  jelly: djszapi: but frankly you seem a bit wobbly even with basic shell syntax and reading docs... are you sure C coding is what you want to do?
11:49  djszapi: themill: do not be silly, just check Nokia phone out pls as I mentioned ;)
11:49  themill: djszapi: sure, send me one and I'll look over it.
11:49  jelly: djszapi: I'd suggest using emdebian
11:50  djszapi: jelly: I have been doing C coding for 5-6 ages in teh industry.
11:50  cryptr: chicognu: I do believe it is that source you already have in your xorg
11:50  cryptr: chicognu: just older.
11:50  djszapi: I do not know how it is related to bash knowledge...
11:50  djszapi: or dpkg internal...
11:50  themill: djszapi: you might like to look at emdebian where they have done precisely what I just mentioned.
11:50  cryptr: chicognu: i use 2.13.0 from them, works for my laptop
11:50  djszapi: or whatever, but a good way to insist me unneccesarily when I would like to help.
11:50  nsadmin: if you want to build a package, you will need more than just C
11:51  cryptr: chicognu: but as we said before, squeeze has 2.12.0 i believe. which will most likely be far better then the lenny version, squeeze is better for laptops anyway then lenny is
11:51  nsadmin: but you could send diffs that are applyable against existing debian sources
11:51  nsadmin: then you don't need to know the packaging system
11:52  nsadmin: but yes, it's misterobvious again... if you don't know the packaging system, you won't be able to build a package yourself
11:52  chicognu: cryptr, I just download the six pack dvd rom :( it is sad need to download anything again :(
11:53  nsadmin: how much download is it?
11:53  cryptr: djszapi: nokia already ditched naemo right? for the redhat thing they have going on with intel
11:53  chicognu: about 25gb nsadmin
11:54  nsadmin: 25 gigs?? just for the driver??
11:54  cryptr: chicognu: ouch, why not just netinstall :)
11:54  nsadmin: nono, not the dvds
11:54  djszapi: jelly: will this version 2 protocol way be global instead of doing separately when I would like to do ?
11:54  TwoTwenty: I luv debian
11:54  TwoTwenty: :)
11:54  nsadmin: how much to download the driver
11:54  TwoTwenty: why is GNU goodness
11:54  chicognu: nsadmin, no .. cryptr  sugest me to install squeezee and I told him that is too sad need to download anyother distro after download the six pack dvds
11:55  nsadmin: you can upgrade your lenny in place
11:55  djszapi: themill: nothing related to embdebian on Nokia phones...
11:55  djszapi: they provide another distribution for sure.
11:55  chicognu: cryptr, I`m a little bit paranoic about go off-line for long periods, so I like to have all softwares in hand if I need
11:55  djszapi: and there are many other cases, rly.
11:56  themill: djszapi: why do you keep going on about nokia? We're talking about debian here.
11:56  nsadmin: just so you know for next time... you don't need to download the dvd or cd images if the machine has a reasonable net connection
11:56  djszapi: is not dpkg debian related stuff ?
11:56  nsadmin: not necessarily
11:56  cryptr: chicognu: ah well to just test you can try netinstall 256mb download or something then just apt-get isntall everything
11:56  djszapi: I wonder again why you insult me instead of apologizing if you say something being incorrect.
11:56  themill: djszapi: no.
11:57  cryptr: chicognu: as nsadmin said, you can also upgrade it
11:57  chicognu: I will try first build the new drivers, to see if it work
11:58  cryptr: chicognu: can be a bit tricky for lenny but do try, I have only done it on squeeze
11:58  nsadmin: djszapi, I would invite you to consider a thought: the only way for someone to insult you is if you give your permission, if you become open to it
11:58  jelly: djszapi: dpkg and apt are used in many distros; this channel only deals with issues in Debian
11:58  themill: djszapi: I'm working very hard here to figure out what your use case is and to point you in the right direction to implement the features you seem to want. You're making it very hard to do so by being very vague and making strange references to some phone company that I know nothing about. Debian is just *one* user of dpkg -- #debian is for debian support.
11:58  nsadmin: chicognu: you may need some or all of the xorg src
11:59  themill: (hence my assumption that you're talking about debian here... and yet you keep refering to nokia as if I know what that means)

12:10  stew: is this all about getting rid of docs post install?
12:10  cryptr: stew: yes :)
12:10  nsadmin: it turns out that it's how to do that for a nokia phone
12:10  stew: then there is no need for a patch, there are already post::invoke hooks
12:11 * cryptr smiles
12:11  djszapi: themill: are you a dpkg developer ?
12:11  themill: stew: apparently none of the three presented options are acceptable. (post-install hooks was mentioned 45minutes ago)
12:11  nsadmin: that point was made an hour ago
12:11  cryptr: I think
12:11  nsadmin: instead of learning about it, he wants to rant n whine
12:11  cryptr: we all need a beer
12:11  cryptr: or several
12:12  stew: and when the docs are too big they should be split into a separate package anyway
12:12  stew: we CANNOT provide a way to get rid of all the docs, since some are required, like copyright
12:12  themill: stew: yeah, that point was made too. And that one.
12:12  stew: ok
12:12  nsadmin: stew: that good point wasn't brought up yet...
12:12  nsadmin: oh it was? I musta missed it
12:12 --- Channel #debian was synced in 145 seconds
12:12  djszapi: stew: ofc, neccesary documentations are not stripped...
12:13  djszapi: strange suggestion they are stripped though...
12:13  cryptr: nsadmin: you were deep in xorg then i think
12:13  nsadmin: oh ok
12:13  stew: djszapi: if there is any package which you think installs too much docs and should have its docs split into a separate package (so you could skip this package), file a wishlist bug
12:14  themill: stew: it would seem this isn't even about debian packages anyway.
12:14  cryptr: stew: I think it is all about him producing own packages for the naemo os (nokia n900 platform)
12:14  nsadmin: themill well to his credit he wants to have debian do it because apparantly he likes debian
12:15  cryptr: djszapi: I am correct in that assumption right? You are doing your own debs for the N900?
12:15  nsadmin: he's frustrated because he didn't know how debian is produced
12:15  dondelelcaro: if this is all about naemo os, just modify dpkg-deb to eliminate everything in /usr/share/doc but the copyright file, ditch all of the man pages, and anything else you don't like, then rebuild the archive.
12:15  dondelelcaro: it's not like it's that hard

12:16  cryptr: silly?
12:16  cryptr: ok
12:16  cryptr: then I apologize
12:16  stew: djszapi: there is no reason to degrade the discussion further by attacking individuals
12:16  nsadmin: I don't think he knows how to build .debs yet; earlier he was wondering why he needed to understand the shell
12:17  djszapi: nsadmin: copy the line for me, pls.
12:17  djszapi: because you lie.
12:17  cryptr: mmm
12:17  cryptr: I actually think it was just a missunderstanding
12:17  stew: unless he has other questions, perhaps we can move on...
12:17  cryptr: where one of us thought djszapi was a bit new to shell and commands
12:18 * nsadmin drops it like the two ton rock that it is
12:18  cryptr: and might have asked him if it was wise to go for C coding
12:18  cryptr: I do think djszapi took that as a very insulting comment
12:18  cryptr: honest mistake I would say
12:18 * themill blows full time

12:21  cryptr: chicognu: where what? inteldriver?
12:21  chicognu: yes
12:21  cryptr: ah
12:21  cryptr: apt-cache show git
12:21  cryptr: is like subversion or cvs
12:21  chicognu: git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/mesa
12:21  cryptr: newer
12:21  themill: cryptr: git-core not git if you're talking about lenny, btw.
12:21  cryptr: chicognu: as we said before also i think, there is a bit more then just doing "make" when you wanna compile new xorg drivers in lenny
12:22  cryptr: chicognu: i still suggest trying to upgrade to squeeze via apt-get
12:22  babilen: chicognu: It refers to the git version control system. Do "git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/mesa" after you've installed git/git-core
12:22  chicognu: Reading state information... Done
12:22  chicognu: E: Couldn't find package git_4.9.4-1_all.deb
12:22  babilen: chicognu: But honestly: What are you trying to achieve?

12:22  cryptr: babilen: install latest xorg intel driver in lenny
12:22  nsadmin: you probably want git-core, but maybe you want to compile the latest git
12:23  cryptr: chicognu: i would change stable/lenny to testing/squeeze in apt/sources.list and dist-upgrade to squeeze
12:23  babilen: cryptr: Not in backports? Is it *really* necessary to install the development version?
12:23  babilen: ... or upgrade to Squeeze?
12:24  cryptr: babilen: could be in backports, I have not checked he has issues with latest i3 cpu and internal video
12:24  nsadmin: babilen, he can't get intel driver to work... the one in lenny doesnt' support his newer hw
12:25  chicognu: what are backports ?
12:25  cryptr: debian.org/backports ?
12:25  nsadmin: packages from newer debians compiled for older ones, so they (forexample) use the libs of the old debian
12:26  djszapi: post hook: The files are first written to disk and only then removed.  It is better to
12:26  djszapi: avoid writing them to disk at all.
12:26  nsadmin: that's what's meant by backports here
12:26  stew: djszapi: then you have to alter the packages, by splitting the packages into separate doc packages
12:26  nsadmin: djszapi: if they're in the tarball, you may not have that choice
12:26  babilen: ,versions xserver-xorg-video-intel
12:26  judd: Package xserver-xorg-video-intel on i386 -- etch: 2:2.2.1-1~etchnhalf2; lenny: 2:2.3.2-2+lenny8; squeeze: 2:2.12.0+shadow-2; sid: 2:2.13.0-2; experimental: 2:2.13.901-2
12:26  chicognu: nsadmin, and how I configure apt-get to use backports ?
12:27  djszapi: nsadmin: with that patch I linked above you have ....
12:27  nsadmin: djszapi, unless you try to do as stew suggests
12:28  babilen: chicognu: The package you need is not in backports and you would most certainly need a newer Xorg version as well. I would suggest to upgrade to Squeeze if that is an option. What kind of machine are we talking about here? (e.g. Laptop for personal use vs. mail server for large company)
12:28  nsadmin: hmm, or try to feed tar with extra args that exclude dirs... if you want to go down that road, that's fine... but I'll have to tell you that the road apples will not only cover the road entirely, the horses will be throwing them at you constantly
12:28  chicognu: laptop
12:28  nsadmin: don't say you weren't warned :)
12:29  chicognu: babilen, I download the 6 dvds from lenny, I really don`t want to download a new version :)
12:29  cryptr: chicognu: you can upgrade withouth actually downloading them by hand, just let apt-get upgrade you.
12:29 * cryptr off for lunch.
12:29  chicognu: cryptr, we are talking about how  many gb ?
12:29  babilen: chicognu: Well, that wasn't a very bright idea in the first place. But you can upgrade from Lenny to Squeeze by downloading *only* those packages you need/have installed already in a newer version.
12:31  nsadmin: chicognu, since you have copies of lenny on dvd, you can copy them to others who might want it (so the download of the images was not a waste)
12:31  babilen: chicognu: Keep in mind that Debian also provides "netinstall" installation images that contain everything you need to setup a (very) basic system. Everything else will be downloaded from the internet during the installation (or afterwards)
12:31  nsadmin: chicognu: it'll tell you the size of the download when you try to do it
12:33  chicognu: nsadmin, I know debian don`t have a regular releases date, but in u experience, what did you think is the expiration date for lenny ?
12:33  nsadmin: oh, actually that's a good point... is squeeze presently able to be upgraded to?
12:33  babilen: chicognu: Soonish (i.e. 2-8 months) ...
12:34  Silex: to cross-compile from debian to windows using mingw32... should I install mingw32 or gcc-mingw32?
12:34  paradigm: chicognu: Debian usually has a release every year and a half to two years, and the old stable is usually spported for about as long
12:34  djszapi: nsadmin: stew suggests ?
12:34  babilen: nsadmin: Well, I am running it at the moment and it works fine. I haven't upgraded Lenny to Squeeze recently though.
12:34  Silex: also is there anything to set beside --target=i386-mingw32 ?
12:34  nsadmin: oh what was he suggesting...
12:34  djszapi: nsadmin:: I am still not a packager, I do not decide what is inside the debian file.
12:35  djszapi: but I would like to decide (as a normal user) what I should install.
12:35  nsadmin: right but you do have the ability to communicate
12:35  nsadmin: btw stew was commenting on the possibility of altering the packages so they're split and this is something you could potentially do on a private mirror
12:36  babilen: chicognu: How old is your Lenny install and how much have you tinkered with it?
12:36  djszapi: nsadmin: it is an overhead to that patch I linked.
12:36  chicognu: babilen, 3 days long :(
12:36  nsadmin: super new
12:36  babilen: chicognu: An infant :)
12:36  chicognu: babilen, and I just install the recent kernel
12:36  CutMeOwnThroat: mgltools seems to sees a bug on my sqeeze in mgltools-pmv's "runPmv" - it seems to be this bug http://mgl.scripps.edu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=584 and indeed be caused by a problem with the ati drivers - should I still file against mgltools-dejavu for a workaround?
12:37  golfdrink: Hello im trying to install a dist on a mac G5, i have tryed the ubuntu powerpc but with not much luck.. can anyone help me ?
12:37  chicognu: recent stable*
12:37  f8l: chicognu: Read about jigdo.
12:37  chicognu: f8l, that is other doubt I have
12:37  dougmencken: golfdrink: try http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/daily/arch-latest/powerpc/iso-cd/debian-testing-powerpc-netinst.iso
12:37  nsadmin: golfdrink: if you want to install debian, that's handled here; ubuntu is not
12:37  babilen: chicognu: Ok, you basically have two options: 1. Upgrade Lenny to Squeeze ("/msg dpkg lenny->squeeze") or 2. Download the Squeeze netinstall image and install Squeeze
12:38  chicognu: between releases many packages can be used with jigdo ?
12:38  nsadmin: golfdrink, just so you know right away...
12:38  dougmencken: golfdrink: also, here's #debianppc channel :)
12:39 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 801]
12:39  chicognu: babilen, there is two hides options in door 3 an 4, compiling the package, or back to ubuntu lts :D
12:39  golfdrink: i know.. i was telling you what i have tryed.. just as the dpkg guidelines sayd
12:40  f8l: chicognu: Quite... Around 70% I'd guess, but I think I can check it. Lenny to squeeze, right?
12:40  nsadmin: golfdrink, ok, so it's debian you want?
12:40  chicognu: f8l,  yes
12:40  f8l: chicognu: It'll take a while.
12:40  chicognu: f8l, if it is too works, there is no need
12:41  chicognu: f8l, I just want to know a estimated number
12:41  babilen: chicognu: I don't think that the new "xserver-xorg-video-intel" package is compatible with the Xorg version in Lenny. (You might need 1.7+)
12:42  nsadmin: chicognu: but honestly, 3d is just one of many things that can be done... debian's basically working on your box; unfortunately 3d is not... what's your take on how important that is for you personally?
12:42  babilen: chicognu: If that is indeed possible, you can easily backport the xserver-xorg-video-intel package from squeeze or sid -- "/msg dpkg ssb"
12:42  chicognu: I`m living a personal dilema right now
12:43  babilen: It is only 3D? *sigh*
12:43  nsadmin: which is solved by playing penguin race? :)
12:43  nsadmin: just kidding
12:43  babilen: chicognu: Well, you know your options. I would suggest installing using the Squeeze netinstall images. But you might prefer something else.
12:43  chicognu: nsadmin, all psx games ... life without street fighter alpha 3 is like a life without woman to a regular guy
12:43  chicognu: :D
12:44 * babilen is out for a fag
12:44  golfdrink: nsadmin: i want a working dist for G5 and what ive read debian seems to be the one of the few acutally working dists...
12:44  nsadmin: chicognu: you -could- approach more women :)
12:45  nsadmin: I mean, you're in -brasil-... dude that's so cool it's not funny
12:46  nsadmin: if you approach about 3000 women in the next year, you'll probably forget what the words "street figher" mean :)
12:46  JyZyXEL: can a udev exec rule be made for a USB hub?
12:46  chicognu: nsadmin, also linux
12:46  chicognu: lol
12:47  stephan49: is thre a way to mount a part of a ext3 filesystem case insentitive?  like "/home/user/test/" is case insentitive and the rest not?
12:48  nsadmin: not that I know of
12:48  blast_hardcheese: oh wow. I just rebooted my machine; The clock was wrong on my BIOS, so it thought the disk had been mounted in the future; I hit Ctrl+C, it dropped me into the management shell... but continued to run the rc init scripts. I ended up in X, WHILE logged into the admin shell. I switched back to VT1, and while I was typing into the admin console, it gave me a login prompt
12:48  osfd: Hi there. Anyone using clementine music player ??
12:49 * nsadmin knows this one!
12:49  nsadmin: you!
12:49  nsadmin: blast_hardcheese: are you running ntpd
12:50  stephan49: nsadmin: k, bad
12:50  nsadmin: ?
12:50  blast_hardcheese: nsadmin: Yes
12:50  stephan49: that you cant mount a fs partly case insensitive
12:50  nsadmin: and so it doesnt' adjust the clock until a not good time
12:51  chicognu: 3000 women in a year, are more or less 31 womans by weekend ... no way I can do that ... If I aproch only 10 womens by weekend, after some field experience for sure I will have at least 3 girls falling in love... But Iam a little bit like Rajesh Koothrappali
12:51  blast_hardcheese: nsadmin: No, because the filesystem check is done before that
12:51  chicognu: replace by > per
12:51  blast_hardcheese: I forced ntpd to run, then rebooted; It checked the disk and now all is well
12:52  nsadmin: chicognu: you can become an approach monster... but it starts by commiting to 1 per some amount of time
12:53  nsadmin: remember that you deliver gifts by only approaching.
12:53  icebrain: stephan49: there is a ext3ci driver which you can use to mount a case insensitive fs
12:53  nsadmin: who is Rajesh Koothrappali?
12:54  chicognu: nsadmin, OMFG, u don`t know ?
12:54  chicognu: nsadmin,  where u live ?
12:54  nsadmin: calif
12:54  icebrain: stephan49: but you probably need to create a partition or similar to hold the mountpoint's contents
12:54  chicognu: nsadmin, u are not a citcom fan right ?
12:54  chicognu: the guy from tbbt
12:54  chicognu: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajesh_Koothrappali
12:54  nsadmin: citcom, dunno what that is
12:55  xteejx: Hi all, I'm creating my first Debian package, and I think it's done, what do I need to do next? Can I get it reveiwed and checked or something?
12:55  chicognu: sitcom sorry
12:57  icebrain: stephan49: you can also use ciopfs (http://www.brain-dump.org/projects/ciopfs/) to mount an existing directory as case insensitive
12:58  nsadmin: got it
12:58  gusnan: xteejx, Do you want it to get into Debian? in that case see http://mentors.debian.net
12:58  xteejx: gusnan: I do, and I'll take a look, thank you :)
12:58  nsadmin: so the wikipedia refers to the selective thing as a recognized medical condition...

13:04 --- Liviu- is now known as Liviu
13:08  chicognu: ok, I will peform dist upgrade
13:08  chicognu: how
13:08  chicognu: but how ?
13:08  babilen: dpkg: lenny->squeeze
13:08  dpkg: In /etc/apt/sources.list, remove stable-specific lines volatile, backports, then change lenny to squeeze.  Use apt-get for the upgrade: "apt-get update && apt-get install linux-image-`uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,` && apt-get dist-upgrade".  Make sure you have a 2.6.32 kernel installed prior to rebooting check: aptitude versions '~nlinux-image~i'.  See also <testing> <testing security> <squeeze release notes>.
13:08  nsadmin: first aptitude update; aptitude safe-upgrade
13:09  nsadmin: oh 3 days old... so lenny is already up to date
13:09  chicognu: ok, I need to install the kernel ?
13:09  babilen: chicognu: You said that you are running a new kernel. Which version? (uname -r)
13:10  nsadmin: chicognu: just so you know I have approach anxiety so bad I hang in the corner
13:10  chicognu: babilen, 2.6.26
13:10  chicognu: babilen, 2.6.36
13:10  nsadmin: babilen: selfcompiled, not make-kpkg
13:10  babilen: chicognu: Ok, that is fine. You don't necessarily need to install a Squeeze kernel then (2.6.32)
13:10  nsadmin: what happens when you run the supplied kernel?
13:11  babilen: nsadmin: Which kernel are you referring to?
13:11  tolland: whats the fastest way to get 5TB from one box to another?
13:11  cryptr: move the drives?
13:11  chicognu: nsadmin, the jme drive is not installed (ethernet driver)
13:11  nsadmin: lenny kernel, 2.6.26-686
13:11  babilen: tolland: Remove harddrive from one computer and put it in the other
13:11  tolland: (can't mount the physical disks its a hardware raid thingamajog)
13:12  cryptr: tolland: ftp i guess would be fastest less overhead
13:12  robokop: tolland: dd + netcat
13:12  nsadmin: ok, so you could hold onto the existing kernel
13:12  nsadmin: but imo the first thing you want to do is upgrade dpkg, apt-get and aptitude
13:12  babilen: !tell nsadmin -about udev squeeze
13:12  abrotman: nsadmin: the bot already told him above ...
13:14  nsadmin: abrotman, there are a coupla special things going on
13:14  abrotman: not really
13:14  nsadmin: babilen: how will the udev and his current kernel fly?
13:14  chicognu: nsadmin, did you ready mystery method ? it is great book, with techniques of approch
13:14  abrotman: he has a newer kernel .. that's about it .. and as long as he's done his newer kernel correctly, it won't be an issue
13:14  babilen: nsadmin: ^^^
13:14  nsadmin: yeah, I have a copy
13:14 --- bluesceada__ is now known as bluesceada_
13:14  f8l: chicognu: Well, I was wrong. These two differ in 95%, so there's almost no gain from using jigdo, unless you have debdelta.
13:15  nsadmin: that's outer game tho... it looks like your sticking point might be more inner
13:15  chicognu: fbh, omg :S
13:16  nsadmin: did you see the vh1 show with mystery?
13:16  chicognu: f8l, omg
13:16  f8l: chicognu: I've checked debian-squeeze-di-beta1-i386-DVD-1.jigdo against debian-506-i386-DVD-1.jigdo.
13:16  nsadmin: chicognu, outer game is a -lot- of work
13:16  chicognu: nsadmin, no, and i hope most girls here also don`t see ... otherwise the chicks will see if I`m following a manual
13:18  nsadmin: it's not that outer is bad... it's more about what you're internally conveying

13:19  nsadmin: ok, so you're running lenny?
13:19  xenol: yes.
13:19  chicognu: nsadmin, to begin it is hard to me even find a wingmen
13:20  chicognu: nsadmin, I read a portugueses version of the book, I don`t know if the technical terms are the same
13:20  abrotman: chicognu: try #debian-offtopic, thank you
13:20  chicognu: abrotman, sorry
13:24  xenol: nsadmin: any ideas?
13:24  nsadmin: what package is it in?
13:24  xenol: ipset

13:25  xenol: ou, bot :>
13:25  rozie: xenol: have you patched kernel?
13:25  nsadmin: so 2.3.3-1
13:25  xenol: nope
13:25  rozie: can't work, then
13:25  nsadmin: he has to rebuild?
13:25  xenol: rozie: i thought so. is there any easy way? ( i can compile from vanilla, but i guess that's not the best idea =))
13:25  abrotman: he might want to install the ipset package and look at /usr/share/doc/ipset/ ?
13:26  rozie: xenol: http://ipset.netfilter.org/install.html
13:26  rozie: it's easy
13:27  MikeH: Hi guys, is it possible to establish when a user was created?
13:28  xenol: rozie: i know, though i would like to stick to things in repo :>
13:28  abrotman: xenol: have you installed the ipset package and looked in the doc directory?
13:28  xenol: yes, right now =)
13:28  rozie: xenol: http://apt-search.pl/ and try to look for ipset
13:29  abrotman: xenol: or `aptitude show ipset` tells you about patch-o-matic
13:29  rozie: there are some repos
13:29  rozie: (unofficial, no guarantee, can kill your dog and burn your house)
13:30  xenol: abrotman: netfilter-something-source

13:37  nsadmin: MikeH, if you put the date somewhere, like insert it into postgres, or put it in the full name field of the passwd file
13:38  nsadmin: if not, it's not going to be easy or maybe even possible
13:38  MikeH: nsadmin, I'm guessing last modified date of /etc/passwd is a pretty good guess
13:38  MikeH: as its the last user added
13:39  nsadmin: could be
13:39  abrotman: MikeH: ls -al $HOME .. look at the timestamps on some of the files?
13:39  nsadmin: or last user modified, or deleted
13:39  MikeH: good plan
13:39  nsadmin: last time the primary group was changed
13:39  MikeH: matches /etc/passwrd last modified

13:41  sander^work: with reports, and alerts.
13:41  JyZyXEL: it only runs the command when device is added
13:41  abrotman: sander^work: you might get a better answer if you define "stuff"
13:42  ash: is there anyway to update samba to 3.4+ on lenny server using apt-get or aptitude?

13:43  ash: ok.. so i add backports to my sources list?
13:43  sander^work: Rienzilla, abrotman: whould like a doc with the advantages of using the diffrent tools.
13:43  Rienzilla: then google it
13:43  Rienzilla: there's several on the market, each with it pro's and con's
13:43  abrotman: ash: the website has instructions
13:43  nsadmin: chicognu so you can put a -d like this aptitude -d safe-upgrade to only download the package files without installing them until you get back to your computer
13:44  Rienzilla: nagios is larger, but more of a pain in the ass to set up imo
13:44  Rienzilla: there's cacti, no experience with it
13:44  babilen: sander^work: ganglia, munin, nagios, cacti …
13:44  abrotman: cacti does some stuff, probably not as much info as nagios, but simpler to setup IIRC
13:44  abrotman: or just set them all up and use them all! :)
13:44  babilen: sander^work: I like nagios FWIW
13:44  ash: cheers!
13:45  babilen: sander^work: A lot of those tools provide a sandbox environment for you to play around with the tools.

13:45  babilen: sander^work: we've used ganglia on one of our clusters @uni ...
13:46  chicognu: nsadmin, but it is more like, if I fail to install the new driver I back to ubuntu LTS
13:46  babilen: chicognu: Please don't download the DVDs
13:46  babilen: !tell chicognu about netinstall
13:46  sander^work: Does all of them use snmp?
13:46  Rienzilla: most can
13:46  nsadmin: chicognu: that's up to you but you don't have to at all, you can just upgrade in place, and only the packages you request and those depended on will ever be transferred
13:46  chicognu: babilen, if i do so, I will download trough the torrent
13:46  babilen: chicognu: That assumes that you have a working (wired) internet connection during the installation though. (Or *not* WPA)

13:48  Andy1978: abrotman: okay, I'll have a look
13:48  nsadmin: babilen: and he's got debian installed now... he can also upgrade
13:49  babilen: chicognu: OK, I can understand that. Just wanted to point out that downloading a full set is typically not necessary. Note that packages are placed on CDs/DVDs in decreasing order of popularity (i.e. most popular packages on CD1, ...)

13:51  JyZyXEL: the device remains somewhere
13:52  nsadmin: so that would be why :)
13:52  nsadmin: what do you really want to know?
13:53  JyZyXEL: how to detect the removal of a USB device
13:53  JyZyXEL: with udev

13:54  nsadmin: here's the problem, here's why people are saying "please don't download all the dvds"
13:55  nsadmin: so debian is free... you can get it, download it, install it, all free
13:55  abrotman: that's not why
13:55  nsadmin: but the bandwidth is anything but free
13:55  abrotman: it's a HUGE waste of bandwidth and donated money/resources

13:56  abrotman: chicognu: yes, then you're wasting your bandwidth and joe-blow, instead of the debian.org infrastructure
13:56  nsadmin: well yes. each connection, costs
13:56  Andy1978: abrotman: hm, is it possible to ast here if I don't get an answer in #debian-live? Perhaps there is a really simple answer
13:56  abrotman: you can try
13:56  chicognu: abrotman, since I share what i get it is pretty much fair
13:57  nsadmin: your cost to the internet is one thing but there are also mirrors, and each one has available bandwidth donated, and that costs serious money
13:57  abrotman: chicognu: not really .. you might not share the same amount, etc .. it's really far better to use the netinst for a single machine and an apt proxy if you're doing a network full of machines
13:58  Andy1978: I tried to set up a debian-live on a USB-Stick with persistent /. The debian-live manual lacks description of the persistent feature. What I did: http://pastebin.com/PBrqQQVV

13:58  JyZyXEL: i wonder if its an actual bug
13:59 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 817]
13:59  chicognu: ok, know I`am angry ... I will mont all my dvds and run apt-get intall *
13:59  chicognu: :D
13:59  JyZyXEL: seems to me that the act of removing USB cord would be enough to spawn a udev remove event
13:59  nsadmin: imagine yourself sending one email... now imagine a very busy mail hub that handles half of brasil
13:59  abrotman: chicognu: that will fail
14:00  nsadmin: perhaps your email goes thru that, very small part of the total of what it does
14:00  babilen: chicognu: *phew* -- that will just result in a syntax error.
14:00  JyZyXEL: This bug makes an application that reports on USB status to fail and causes HAL to endlessly increment the identifier for the same physical device.
14:00  nsadmin: chicognu, you'll probably need a tb or two to install everything
14:00  JyZyXEL: that is what totally happens on lenny
14:00  JyZyXEL: the device identifier is incremented forever
14:01  potty: lalalalalallalalala
14:01  chicognu: since I WILL share what I GET I don`t see a problem with that, None did told anything about that argument
14:01  potty: Adriaan, hola compañero
14:02  abrotman: babilen: aptitude install '!~i' ?
14:02  chicognu: JyZyXEL, even after a reboot ?
14:02  JyZyXEL: probably not after that
14:02  babilen: abrotman: hehe :-D

14:03 --- juergen_dose is now known as car
14:07  JyZyXEL: i wonder if there are any workaround other than installing squeeze
14:12  JyZyXEL: oh apparently the reasoning is that when udev gets the remove event the device directory is already gone and sysfs values aren't readable anymore
14:17  silverballz: im having issues mounting hardware (cdrom, SD card, Etc.). Also this is the first time i've install debian with LVM2 kernel module. SD card says "wrong file system, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1... try 'dmesg | tail or so'" dmesg returns "can not open `or' `so' for reading: no such file directory. Is it possible that my issues are because of LVM encryption. I've been a bit unorganized so the frustration is setting in...
14:19  nsadmin: silverballz I'll suggest you take one thing at a time, and get into it specifically
14:19  nsadmin: if you explore one of them and it turns out to contribute to the solution of all the others, so much the better
14:20  nsadmin: oh, and you should try dmesg | tail
14:21  silverballz: indeed, thank you nsadmin for the encouragement and advice.
14:21  nsadmin: the "or so" is like "approximately"

14:38  CutMeOwnThroat: I have APT::Install-Recommends "no"; in apt.conf - overriding this from the commandline doesn't seem to work, neither  apt-get install --install-recommends debichem-visualisation, nor aptitude -r install debichem-visualisation install the recommended packages
14:38  CutMeOwnThroat: is this a bug or am I just overseeing something?

14:42  CutMeOwnThroat: I just commented the line in the configuration file with the same result... aptitude why v-sim prints i   debichem-visualisation Recommends v-sim, but dpkg -l whos "un v-sim..."
14:43  jelly: CutMeOwnThroat: is v-sim installable at all?
14:44  CutMeOwnThroat: don't see why not... I can do apt-get install vsim and it says it'll install it
14:44  CutMeOwnThroat: I think I'm just not seeing something obvious

14:47  djszapi: Do I need to subscribe for debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org to be able to send a mail ? Because I can read this at the top of the page: This list is not moderated; posting is allowed by anyone.
14:49  Zenox: How can I install a slightly older kernel (linux-image) when using Debian Squeeze?
14:50  babilen: djszapi: AFAIK you don't need to be subscribed. It makes sense to ask to be CCed in that case.
14:50  abrotman: Zenox: why would you want to? and which one?
14:51 --- Blaize0 is now known as Blaize
14:51  fishcooker: how to config the keyboard stuff?
14:53  Zenox: abrotman: I have this one right now (on hold) = linux-image-2.6.32-5-amd64, but it has problems with specific usb-serial devices (from version -25 and up)
14:54  CutMeOwnThroat: what's also disturbing is, that apt-get -f install finds not problems, while aptitude -f install wants to do all kinds of things
14:54  abrotman: Zenox: you should probably work with the kernel team to resolve those issues, putting your kernel on hold leaves you at risk for security issues fixed in later kernels
14:57  Zenox: abrotman: Yes, but it's pretty recent (version 25, and now 27 is released). My device isn't working and I rely on it. The kernel team is aware of the situation, but it takes time to investigate how to fix it as well
14:57  abrotman: !tell Zenox about hold
14:58  CutMeOwnThroat: actually aptitude why v-sim says it has to be installed because of the dependency, but that's of course not useful if that doesn't happen... it also says so when I have recommends switched off...
14:58 --- Liviu is now known as Guest49774
14:58 --- Guest49774 is now known as Liviu-
14:58  vtts: Zenox, have you tried something like: aptitude install <linux-image-new>_ <linux-image-older>
14:58  Zenox: abrotman: Yes I know about hold. I know about bad responses from usb-serial devices too. I want to use an slightly older kernel until the kernel team has fixed the current bug
14:58  vtts: this would purge current(new) image and install older version
14:59  vtts: but check if it is available in deb repository
14:59  vtts: i.e. if older one is available
15:00  abrotman: Zenox: so get it from snapshot.debian.org .. force the install/downgrade, then place it on hold
15:00  mtnman: hello
15:00  Zenox: vtts: Hmm, haven't tried that. Will check if I find one.
15:01  themill: djszapi: btw, it would pay to look at the thing that dpkg already supports before starting on your quest. The patch you posted earlier was a poor hack and there is already something that is much better than that in dpkg. See the --patch-exclude option in man dpkg on squeeze.
15:02  themill: djszapi: so yes, there is something wrong with that patch you posted earlier -- there's something better there already.
15:02  Zenox: abrotman: Ah okay, will browse that site. Hopefully I'll se that 24 version. Just download the deb file and execute "dpkg -i"?
15:02  abrotman: and force the install/downgrade
15:04  Zenox: abrotman: Or. The site has info on how it's done (add correct date to sources.list etc). Thanks for all your help :)
15:04  abrotman: that's another option, yes
15:04  eshat: what was the package name, that helped recompiling a newer upstream version ?

15:06  lng: col #8
15:07  CutMeOwnThroat: how very strange, now it works, after I brought gcc-4.4-base to the latest version in squeeze... I think aptitude should at least have printed some error instead of just not doing the recommends
15:08  vtts: lng, D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
15:08  vtts: lng, you can check "man ps" for more
15:08  lng: I did
15:09  lng: found it now
15:09  lng: thanks!
15:09  CutMeOwnThroat: abrotman, is that something I should write a bug-report about? I fear will be difficult to reproduce... and I haven't really worked out what caused this
15:10  CutMeOwnThroat: right now looks as if aptitude saw a problem with the recommends and so just silently dropped them
15:15  HackeMate: hello, I want keep my logs for 6 months and split them per day or if not possible, per size

15:15  gnublin: what log ?
15:16  HackeMate: the dhcpd log from dhcp3-server
15:16  HackeMate: I already save it in /var/log/dhcpd/dhcpd.log
15:16  stew: HackeMate: man logrotate, you'd want something like 'rotate 183' and daily

15:21  wolfric_: i've just installed debian 5.3 from cd. i don't have the cd any more so i've commented out the cdrom in sources list... what other sources should i have or is there a page to compare against? I've tried apt-get update.
15:22  stew: wolfric_: /msg dpkg lenny sources.list
15:22  HackeMate: thanks, I added size 4096, i hope it works now, surely it will
15:22  stew: wolfric_: assuming you mean 5.0.3 or something, as 5.3 doesn't exist
15:22  unomi: Hi, I am trying to get started with kvm on lenny, using virt-manager I get: Cannot determine QEMU argv syntax /usr/bin/kvm

15:22  stew: wolfric_: doesn't exist
15:22  wolfric_: lol
15:23  ttiicc: I installed debian as a desktop so I got the whole X with it. I have configured the system as I want and would like it to start without X. I was thinking just changing the S30gdm to K30gdm. Is this the right thing to do? Any thing else which should be done?
15:23  wolfric_: someone named the disk wrong...
15:23  stew: wolfric_: probably 5.0.6 which is the current release
15:23  stew: ttiicc: which directory are you doing the renaming in?
15:23  CutMeOwnThroat: !tell ttiicc -about nox
15:24  CutMeOwnThroat: ttiicc, yes, or uninstall gdm if you don't want to use it anyway...
15:24  stew: I love how that factoid tells you to do the thing that update-rc.d tells you is a mistake, and acknowleges why
15:24  wolfric_: stew: ok it's 5.0.6
15:24  stew: instead he is doing the thing that update-rc.d recommendss (although without update-rc.d)
15:25  wolfric_: stew: is that still lenny?
15:25  stew: wolfric_: yes
15:25  ttiicc: I would like to have gdm, just not starting with it
15:25  sander^work: What should I do when creating a .deb package.. then the installation writes to a file owned by another package?..
15:25  sander^work: when*
15:25  stew: ttiicc: which directory were you renaming S30gdm to K30gdm?
15:25  stew: sander^work: file a bug
15:25  stew: sander^work: assuming both packages are from the same release
15:26  ttiicc: rc2.d I haven't done it yet
15:26  CutMeOwnThroat: haven't seen that factoid in a while - doesn't look like I remember it
15:26  stew: ttiicc: that would work (for runlevel 2, which is the default)
15:26  CutMeOwnThroat: this "NEWSFLASH" thing is also weird
15:27  sander^work: stew, Well.. I'm trying to create a .deb package for libapache2-mod-fcgid from svn
15:27  ttiicc: yes I rename it to K30gdm in rc2.d and that's about all I need to do?
15:27  sander^work: stew, apt-get install subversion; svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/mod_fcgid/trunk mod_fcgid; cd mod_fcgid/; APXS=/usr/bin/apxs2 ./configure.apxs; make; checkinstall
15:27  ttiicc: and If I would like to get X I just rename it back and reboot my system?
15:27  stew: sander^work: if your package is going to provide a file also provided by another package, you should conflict with it, and perhaps declare that yours Replaces: the other
15:28  CutMeOwnThroat: why does update-rc.d tell you this is a mistake?
15:28  stew: ttiicc: yes.  and no need to reboot just /etc/init.d/gdm restart
15:28  ttiicc: !update-rc.d
15:28  dpkg: [update-rc.d] used to manipulate System V style init script links, which are used to stop/start system services.  Read the update-rc.d man page for a good introduction to Debian's boot process.  For front-ends, ask me about <rcconf>, <sysv-rc-conf>, <bum>.
15:28  stew: CutMeOwnThroat: the update-rc.d manpage calls this a "common administrative error" or some such.  for the reason listed in the factoid you gave
15:29  wolfric___: stew: Does this look ok? http://pastebin.com/sHCDBeNB
15:29  sander^work: stew, Well.. I think it just adds a line to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf but in reality.. it should be added to /etc/apache2/modules-avaible/mod_fcgid.load or something.
15:30  stew: wolfric___: what you have is ok, but you also need a main mirror (the two you have listed so far are just updates, not a full distribution)
15:30  noir_lord: I installed Stable (ubuntu refugee it blew up one time too many) but needed a newer release of Gimp, modified sources.list to point to testing set default release to avoid accidental conflicts then using apt-get -t to attempt to install gimp, it says it can't resolve package dependencies
15:30  CutMeOwnThroat: stew, right, seeing that... the factoid also tells you it'll break instead of giving you a solution that won't :) ... so fairysnuff
15:30  stew: wolfric___: what country are you in?
15:30  noir_lord: is it a good idea to use Testing as a general use desktop, I'm a developer (application and web)
15:30  wolfric___: ireland
15:31  stew: sander^work: debian policy forbids you from altering the conffile of another package, yes, adding a file to modules-available is the better solution
15:31  wolfric___: stew: not a bit strange it didn't add one in automatically on install?
15:31  stew: wolfric___: "deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian lenny main"
15:31  sander^work: stew, someone else did this in the current mod_fcgid package..
15:32  wolfric___: stew: cheers
15:33  sander^work: stew, I whould like the current mod_fcgid package to be updated, because of a bug (fixed in latest svn): https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48981
15:33  sander^work: makes the package unusable performance wise.
15:34  stew: sander^work: someone did which? modified apache2.conf?
15:34  sander^work: stew, made the mod_fcgid package compatible with debian.
15:35  stew: ahh
15:35  stew: iirc this was a package we had a long time ago and it was removed/
15:35  stew: is this the non-free one?
15:36  stew: oh, no we still have this one, so yeah, i'd assume its not making huge mistakes like modifying apache.conf
15:36  sander^work: stew, Oh sorry.. I retrived it at first from ubuntu..
15:37  djura-san: o/
15:37  sander^work: Okay..
15:37  sander^work: Its a really useless package with this bug.
15:38  stew: sander^work: is this bug reported to the debian bts?
15:38  sander^work: pitty mod_fcgid isn't even relased as stable without this bug.
15:38  sander^work: stew, I have no clue.
15:38  CutMeOwnThroat: stew, check if you still see problems with the nodm factoid?
15:38  stew: sander^work: can you please check?
15:39  stew: sander^work: if the package we are about to release in squeeze is not useful, the RMs should know about it
15:39  stew: CutMeOwnThroat: thanks!
15:39  sander^work: stew, where do I search?.. Im not that familar with where.
15:40  stew: sander^work: bugs.debian.org/packagename
15:40  sander^work: stew, I have only tested it with ubuntu 10.04.. I suspect they took the package from debian.
15:41  stew: sander^work: oh, you aren't a debian user at all?
15:41  sander^work: stew, I am.
15:41  sander^work: stew, but not for this server.
15:41  ttiicc: I have installed debian stable + myswl server and Im now running the system without X, could it be true that my system is running on only 119MB RAM?
15:41  CutMeOwnThroat: stew, still don't like that "and friends" expression, but the shortest do disable all I can think of is a for-loop and that might be too long...
15:42  stew: ttiicc: sure, if you've not yet gotten around to tuning mysql
15:43  sander^work: stew, I think its better to go to the source of the problem.. instead of reporting it to ubuntu. :-)
15:43  ttiicc: stew: hehehehe
15:43  CutMeOwnThroat: mh, and I see something else that's wrong, it's not "gdm" anymore in squeeze, but gdm3
15:43  stew: sander^work: yeah, that's why we'd be pointing you to #ubuntu
15:45  sander^work: stew,

15:47  stew: sander^work: http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities
15:47  sander^work: stew, isn't ubuntu taking packages from debian?.. if its fixed in debian, then it will sooner fixed in ubuntu also?.

15:51  sander^work: dwahlstrom, cdrado -scanbus or something (after what I remember).. But it only lists the dvd drive.
15:51  sander^work: dwahlstrom, the name is wrong I guess.
15:52  dwahlstrom: sander^work: i got it to work. thanks!
15:52  eshat: how can I install package dependecies, that should be read from debian/control ?
15:52  stew: sander^work: i don't know.  feel free to ping the bug asking
15:53  stew: eshat: Depends: or Build-Depends:?
15:53  eshat: stew: buidl-depends ;)
15:53  eshat: build*
15:54  eshat: the thing is, I patched a debian/control file and want to intall the build dependecies according to this file
15:54  stew: eshat: although it won't actually be reading debian/control, but the cached version from apt, "apt-get build-dep packagename" should work
15:54  eshat: stew: see my previous post
15:54  stew: eshat: afaik you'd have to do it by hand unless you were using something like pbuilder/cowbuilder
15:55  eshat: stew: hmm, ok it isn't to much work, but I though there is an automated way
15:55  sander^work: stew, how do I do that?
15:56  stew: sander^work: by emailing bugnumber@bugs.debian.org

What I'm doing is something quick and dirty so I'd appreciate a quick & dirty solution to this problem: After upgrading the system (which is running on a RAMdisk, hence I can't reboot with a newer kernel version) I wanted to mount a usb memory stick. However despite udev being installed and running no device like hdb or sda shows up in /dev. MAKEDEV all has no effect. Can anybody tell me how I can get the device file
16:02  eshat: stew: yes but it also gives a list of missing deps, which makes it easy to intall by a one-liner

16:04  Janni: As I described above, udev does not seem to do anything...
16:05  ScottO_: what device is it again?
16:05  Janni: usb 1-3
16:05  ScottO_: no i mean what is it
16:05  CutMeOwnThroat: anyway, as this isn't debian, but debian-live, you might want #debian-live at irc.oftc.net

16:12  CutMeOwnThroat: fulat2k, aptitude changelog <package> might help, or apt-get source <package> and check what changes are applied to the tarball
16:13  stew: fulat2k: you can go to http://packages.debian.org/php5 click on a version, then download the .diff.gz which is the patch against the (modified) upstream tarball
16:14  fulat2k: stew: i'm basing it on the web server headers.  not sure if that's the one you quoted
16:14  fulat2k: CutMeOwnThroat: i'll try that along with stew's recommendation
16:15  CutMeOwnThroat: (the 2nd was the same as stews suggestion, but letting apt-get do the downloading)
16:15  d0uglas: hi folks. so let's say I want to grep my access log to scoop out something like (Linux; U; Android 2.0; en-us; .. how could I do that? -e? quotes? for multiple words and symbols
16:15  d0uglas: made an effort manning grep..
16:16  yang: I am having some sort of a "iceweasel" bug, it keeps starting always after reboot, even that I haved closed all previous windows before, and when exiting from it, it gives me some crashing error code...
16:17  CutMeOwnThroat: d0uglas, you need quotes, (take ') but that belongs more to #bash... you want "man 7 regex" for the "something like"-part
16:18  stew: d0uglas: fgrep 'Linux; ; Android 2.0; en-us' ? or is some of the stuff variable?
16:21  d0uglas: thanks guys
16:21  d0uglas: appreciate that
16:22  d0uglas: stew the Linux; ; Android 2.0; en-us was just part of a user agent string, not broken up

16:29  d0uglas: maybe with tail?

16:31  wolfric__: if i go to gparted and right click and go to partition information it says unable to read the contents of this filesystem. (it's ntfs)
16:34  AmberJ: Hello, I recently installed debian from xfce+lxde ISO. When I booted into debian, I did "dpkg -R" to install all packages on installation media (i.e. my pendrive). Now when I try to boot into debian I get this error: http://codepad.org/UEWQs42w
16:35  AmberJ: What could be causing this problem>?
16:36  dancios: is arm hard fp arm port avaliable for downlad & test ?
16:36  AmberJ: I remember some prompt when I did "dpkg -R" which said that it could cause no partition to be mounted as root if I proceed with that particular package install (or something like that)
16:40  AmberJ: Also, it drops me to a (initramfs) prompt
16:43  AmberJ: Is this problem related with updating to grub 2? (I'm starting to get some installation memories back)
16:43  CutMeOwnThroat: AmberJ, how should anyone be able to say with this information... obviously it doesn't find the disk/partition combination specified to mount root on. Nothing else you say gives further clues as to why. You might see what update-grub tells you
16:45  CutMeOwnThroat: first thing to do would be to figure out where the root filesystem is...
16:46  CutMeOwnThroat: !rescue
16:46  dpkg: extra, extra, read all about it, rescue is at http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/FAQ ("Can I use d-i as a rescue system?").  Ask me about <rescue mode>.  See also <fixmbr> and <i forgot root's password>.
16:46  AmberJ: CutMeOwnThroat: you mean the partition where root fs is located? like /dev/sdc1?
16:46  CutMeOwnThroat: yes...  or like /dev/[hs]da1, what it seems to be trying right now
16:49  AmberJ: CutMeOwnThroat: Ok. I found out the partition. Now?
16:49  blue_anna: ubuntu's 10.10 is broken out of the box for gnome on the ppc system, I was thinking about trying out debian. is there a guide on how to temporarily switch back and forth between ubuntu and debian on the disk ?
16:49  AmberJ: chroot into existing system?
16:50  AmberJ: and then edit some file?  (that's what I am guessing)

16:51  omes: home sweet home...
16:51  omes: i've been squatting #centos for the last couple of days, due to that distro being developed on mescaline...
16:51  abrotman: blue_anna: is /home/ a separate partition ?
16:51  omes: I'm ready to confess my sins.. ;)
16:52  blue_anna: abrotman, yes, I did a custom partitioning
16:52  CutMeOwnThroat: blue_anna, probably... but all you do is to install on a separate partition and configure grub of one of them to be able to boot all... sharing /home and swap partitions if possible
16:52  blue_anna: CutMeOwnThroat, I'm on a powerpc .. there is no grub
16:52  abrotman: blue_anna: you could just install/reinstall each one .. it's not hard to get Debian up and running in a short time
16:53  blue_anna: abrotman, you mean like, directly with apt ?
16:53  abrotman: no .. i mean, an actual system install
16:53  abrotman: if you want to evaluate debian first, you could use virtualbox etc
16:54  abrotman: wait .. does vbox run on ppc ?
16:54  CutMeOwnThroat: blue_anna, oh, right, you said... which reminds me... there's also #debianppc on irc.oftc.net
16:54  blue_anna: CutMeOwnThroat, thanks :) I'll ask there aobut the glib issue
16:54  abrotman: blue_anna: you're asking #debianppc about Ubuntu ?
16:55  blue_anna: abrotman, no .. I'm just thinking to verify that debian doesn't in fact have the same problem
16:55  abrotman: blue_anna: probably easier to just try it :)
16:55  abrotman: if you have fast internet, it won't take you long
16:57  blue_anna: abrotman, okay .. does it have a live cd or .. how do I specifically go about doing this?  tell you the truth, I have a spare harddrive, if it gets too complicated I can just swap out and install on taht one
16:57  abrotman: blue_anna: i dont' believe that the debian-live project has a PPC version
16:58  stew: abrotman: iirc it supports ppc but doesn't seem distribute one.  so perhaps one can build their own with live-helper or whatever it is
17:05  Dewi: having a bit of trouble with unionfs-fuse
17:05  Dewi: it will pass writes to a read-only branch, and then refuse to delete the file it just created
17:06  Dewi: what I really want is for it to just never hit a "disk full" condition unnecessarily
17:06  Dewi: I don't mind which underlying FSes it writes
17:06  blue_anna: is there an easy way to build the iso's directly from the jigdo urls ?
17:06  Dewi: maybe I should be using aufs or something?
17:09  blue_anna: because the torrent is giving me an error
17:09  abrotman: blue_anna: it's really easier to download the netinst ISO
17:09  stew: blue_anna: why not just download an iso with a web browser?
17:09  blue_anna: it said the preferred way was to use jigdo :)
17:10  blue_anna: so I downlaoded jigdo and .. the cli is a little lackluster
17:10  Dewi: blue_anna: use a mirror near to you if you're worried. It will also be nice and fast
17:10  abrotman: blue_anna: really, get the netinst ISO .. it's only 160MB or so ..
17:10  tgywa: can Nagios anticipate disk failur?
17:11  robokop: tgywa: sometimes SMART can, and you can write a nagios plugin to monitor smart results
17:11  Dewi: tgywa: smartmontools sometimes can
17:12  Dewi: yeah what robokop said. Although I think smartd will already email root if things look bad....
17:12  tgywa: robokop, my disk doesn't support smartmontools... tried but can't enable it
17:12  robokop: Dewi: indeed, but he asked if nagios could do it
17:12  tgywa: robokop, it is she ... not he
17:12  tgywa: thank u
17:12  robokop: tgywa: sorry i don't know another way then smart
17:13  robokop: tgywa: sorry my fair lady
17:13  blue_anna: that doesnt appear to be available in powerpc
17:13  robokop: hard to see from a nick tbh
17:13  stew: blue_anna: what is "that"?
17:14  blue_anna: a netinstall- .. oo I see its just a CD? :)

17:38  Boohemian: 2.0.1 was released 10/23/2006!
17:38  Boohemian: eshat: 4 years for lenny to catch up!?!!?
17:38  eshat: well, I am sure there a good reasons for the old version beeing in lennt
17:38  eshat: lenny*
17:40  Boohemian: laziness?
17:41  stew: Boohemian: the version in lenny is version 2.1.11 not 1.2.1
17:41  atula: greetings. I know that you should not serve your (source codes) along with the static files in the same directory.  But to what extent? If I were to put my codes in /src/myproject  and symlink my media directory into /static/myproject_media and serve them via apache that way... is that safe?  I guess what's confusing to me is, if they can mess around with directory, wouldn't they be able to get to the other directory? Could someone offer some thoughts?  thank
17:41  atula: (web site)
17:42  Boohemian: aha, stew lol
17:42  stew: Boohemian: 2.1.11 was released in June 2008, 2.1.12 was released in Feb 2009.  since lenny was frozen in 2008, it looks like it had the most recent version at the time it was frozen
17:43  Boohemian: stew: what does "frozen" mean? no more packages are added to lenny after that date in 2008?
17:43  stew: Boohemian: yes
17:43  Boohemian: stew: why?
17:43  stew: Boohemian: well, not after it was released in 2009
17:43  stew: Boohemian: because it is stable now
17:44  Boohemian: oh, which means you can't add any new packages to it, else you could break it?
17:44  stew: Boohemian: so it should only get security fixes (with some rare exceptions)
17:44  Boohemian: so, you have to use backports, right?
17:44  stew: Boohemian: yes
17:44  Boohemian: i've had to install code the old fashioned way once: tomcat6
17:44  gandhijee: hey guys, how can i change the order my modules are loaded in?
17:45  antivirtel: hello all!
17:46  antivirtel: I want to ask, that what does rpc do? http://www.linuxsecurity.com/resource_files/host_security/securing-debian-howto/ch8.en.html#s8.10 <-- I found this, but I think thats not enough info about RPC, it is required for a single lenny webserver?! :D
17:48  stew: Boohemian: so you were confused by the 1: at the beginning of the version number, which is the "epoch" which is added by debian, you can ignore that part to get the upstream version.  more about it here: http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version
17:49  Boohemian: stew: thank you!

21:04  e7th04sh: Hello #debian, i am going through the processes on my machine trying to figure out what i dont need and should disable
21:04  ska: I see it installed on some systems, but don't know why.
21:04  e7th04sh: so the very first alphabetically is afpd, ApplTalk Filing daemon - what do i need this protocol for?
21:07  peterrooney: e7th04sh: you might want to start with installing apt-file (aptitude install apt-file; apt-file), use it to search for which package owns the startup script.  then apt-cache show <package>
21:07  Dekkzter: is there any way to start the debian installer inside an functioning debian install?
21:07  peterrooney: e7th04sh: eg: apt-file search /etc/init.d/afpd ; apt-cache show <whatever package it is>
21:08  e7th04sh: peterronney in most cases a google search reveals what it is
21:08  e7th04sh: by a process name
21:08  peterrooney: e7th04sh: oh, and earlier, i should have said "aptitude install apt-file; apt-file update"
21:08  e7th04sh: thanks, tough i already know how to install stuff on debian
21:08  e7th04sh: ;-)
21:09  e7th04sh: anyways, finding out which package it comes from is often not helpful at all
21:09  e7th04sh: for example afpd - i know what it is, however i don;t know wether it is really used at all and thus can i disable it without any harm
21:10  Dekkzter: is there any way to start the debian installer from shell inside an functioning debian install?
21:10  e7th04sh: btw would you happen to know how to get statistics on resource use of different processes?
21:10  peterrooney: e7th04sh: well, aptitude has the -s (simulate) option.  if another package actually needs it, you shall be informed without any actual changes made.
21:11  e7th04sh: peterrooney it's not only the packages that might need it, it can just be me
21:12  e7th04sh: i just might be unaware that certain daemon or other process provides some option i use
21:12  Dekkzter: is there any way to start the debian installer from shell inside an functioning debian install?
21:12  e7th04sh: ok i need to reset this box, see you sson
21:12  e7th04sh: Dekkzter, you won;t get an answer earlier if you keep on posting the same question over and over again
21:12  aryko: Hello, I'd like to know if there's still a way to have something similar to stable,testing,unstable specified in my /etc/apt/sources.list with a /etc/apt/preferences file? I'd like to be able to use some unstable packages on a stable system.
21:13  Dekkzter: e7th04sh maybe if people didnt see it the first time? :) well. i wont spam it anymore
21:13  Kamping_Kaiser: bolt: ah, no worries :)
21:13  Kamping_Kaiser: Dekkzter: after say 4 hours try again. 4 minutes is a bit daft
21:14  Dekkzter: as i said.. i wont spam it anymore
21:14  Kamping_Kaiser: Dekkzter: to answer the question - no, i don't think d-i will run from a term. you can try bootstrap+manual grub setup (or similarly manual way)
21:15  badzo: hi. i've just installed sid and i have one problem. iin lenny i could easily adjust pcspkr volume with xset command. now i cant do it, xset just doesnt work and adjusting volume in alsamixer neither. what could I do?

21:28  bolt: backports, if availale
21:28  Kurin: it's not in backports
21:28  breardo: ok.. sorry for being stupid here.. but im new to debian.. what are backports?  they are somehow newer versions of software in the apt repos? or something like that?
21:30 --- lynucs is now known as jham
21:30  Kamping_Kaiser: breardo: yes
21:30  jhutchins2: beardy: Backports are more recent versions of packages typically from the testing or unstable branches that are built against the stable environment.  Typically they offer new features and functionality, but do not require an extensive replacement of system components.
21:30  Kamping_Kaiser: breardo: http://backports.debian.org/ has more details
21:30  jhutchins2: beardo:^
21:30  breardo: ok.. cool.. thanks :)
21:30  breardo: i've been frustrated at the lack of newer software in the apt repos.. so this is what i need to add to my sources..
21:30  jhutchins2: breardo: Tough nick....
21:30  breardo: i'll read that, thanks
21:30  breardo: haha yeah sorry :)
21:31  jhutchins2: breardo: It's recommended that you only use backports you specifically need, as the stable system has not been tested for all possible interactions with all possible backports.
21:32  breardo: that makes sense
21:32  jhutchins2: breardo: It's important to remember that while the base versions of packages in stable may not be very recent, the packages are patched for security and bug fixes.

22:12  JGuzman: should I simply install it_
22:13  stew: JGuzman: if you don't have xorg and want it, we'd recommend "aptitude install xorg"
22:13  JGuzman: ok stew
22:13  JGuzman: I was not sure If I should install it
22:13  JGuzman: but I guess this is the only way to get the driver of the graphic card

22:31  JGuzman: yes
22:31  JGuzman: but it does not work

22:32  JGuzman: xrand
22:32  JGuzman: xrandr, sorry
22:32  stew: JGuzman: you showed me the output of that command, and it worked

23:14  amee2k: how do i do the manual configuration thing?
23:14  hramrach_: I expected it. That's probably where I found the detection broken but I had an ISA card

23:29  amee2k: not it only needs to be able to cope with not having usb in the system
23:29  hramrach_: is that that much of a problem? I think I have a few USB-free systems
23:30  amee2k: hehe
23:30  amee2k: well, the 3.1 netinst seems to choke on it
23:30  hramrach_: that's odd. Back then USB was not that widespread
23:31  amee2k: it failed to mount /dev/shm and /dev/pts properly, but continued anyway
23:31  amee2k: later it failed with something like /proc/bus/usb: invalid argument
23:32  amee2k: red-screening the installer with a message that debootstrap failed
23:33  hramrach_: maybe they just removed the 3.1 repos
23:33  amee2k: i don't think so. it happened at the end of the install base system step
23:34  amee2k: other than configuring the NIC it shouldn't be using the network at all yet
23:34  amee2k: i didn't even get to configure the repos
23:35  hramrach_: why do you bother with the card not being detected then?
23:35  hramrach_: I had to install from floppies so it was an issue then
23:35  amee2k: i want to have it in the final system, and its the easiest if i can install it during setup
23:35  amee2k: and maybe i'll need to install some stuff from the net for it
23:38  ash130: anyone had luck connecting windows 7 to samba domain v3.5.6
23:38  ash130: i have already tried the reg hacks
23:39  hramrach_: which Win7 variant?
23:40  ash130: just a sec
23:40  ash130: it is a new pc
23:41  ash130: win7 pro
23:42  hramrach_: then it should be possible but I did not really connect any win7 to any domain so far
23:42  huggy_72: /msg dpkg guidelines
23:43  ash130: anyone else had success?
