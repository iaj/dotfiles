00:00  mooglenorph: Hi, what's the "nicest" way to render an ascii or utf8 text file to postscript? For printing?
00:01  mooglenorph: Preferebly with some options about headers and stuff that I can tweak.
00:03  zulax: is there a separate dowload for server editions of Debian or are all the same?
00:05  dondelelcaro: zulax: we don't have editions; you can install a version of Debian for anything from the same mirrors
00:05  dondelelcaro: zulax: the only difference between some mirrors is whether they are complete, or only mirror some architectures
00:06  zulax: okay, been used to ubuntu so was wondering how it is like in real Debian World
00:07  zulax: Hopefully after playing around with ubuntu a little bit, I am ready for my own debian server
00:07  dondelelcaro: zulax: ah; yeah, the only thing in debian that differentiates what you use a Debian machine for is which packages you decide to install
00:07  jhutchins_lt: zulax: Debian's a bit more of a do-it-yourself distro.
00:08  ScottG: Anyone know of a program to convert images to a pdf file?
00:09  zulax: uname -m gives me i686 but i dont see that arch. in debian download page
00:09  dondelelcaro: ScottG: there are lots of them; what type of image do you want to convert?
00:09  jhutchins_lt: ScottG: Well, the easy way would be to past the image to an ooffice document and save to pdf.  Gimp could probably print to pdf if you have the pdf print filter installed.
00:09  dondelelcaro: zulax: that's i386
00:09  jhutchins_lt: Imagemagic can probably convert them.
00:10  ScottG: jhutchins_lt: Ah good idea. Gonna check out gs too
00:10  dondelelcaro: unfortunatly, imagemagick does a kind of crappy job
00:10 * dondelelcaro personally uses a custom package of png2pdf which properly handles alpha channels
00:11  zulax: dondelelcaro, online? http://www.pdfonline.com/convert-pdf/
00:12  dondelelcaro: zulax: oh, probably; I don't personally like sending my data to random online sites, though
00:13  zulax: is there a way to know beforehand if PHP5 is released for current Debian version, similarly what version of ruby is in the official repos ?
00:14  Arrowmaster: zulax: packages.debian.org
00:15  zulax: dondelelcaro, gimp?
00:15  zulax: i am not sure but even openoffice might do it
00:16  Joint: hello there i have a question Yesterday i did some dist-upgrade to update it some packages. everything went fine, until today that my wireless, got disable how can i fix this?
00:17  Joint: the driver is ath5k
00:18  zulax: I now sense a possible problem, I only have 1 cd to burn right now (flash drive boot doesnt work)
00:19  zulax: if debian doesnt support the wireless, i am not going to have a good night sleep
00:21  rooisto47: l/X
00:21  stew: zulax: which chipset is the wireless?
00:22  Joint: can someone help me ?
00:22  Joint: with my error?
00:22  Joint: or to help me to bring my wlan0 interface up
00:22  Joint: in my network-manager it says wireless is disable
00:22  Joint: how do i re enable it?
00:24  Some_Person: Joint: What kind of card?
00:24  zulax: stew, i believe its listed as Ethernet? its intel co. Pro/100 VE
00:24  Joint: Some_Person, is an ath5k
00:26  Joint: can someone help me?
00:26  tharkun: dondelelcaro: where can i download that package ;P
00:26  Joint: SIOCSIFFLAGS: Unknown error 132
00:26  Joint: how come?
00:29  Joint: damn no one fucking helps
00:30  anao: Joint?
00:30  KB1JWQ: Joint: Please be patient / watch your language.
00:30  anao: which problem.?
00:30  Joint: my ath5k wireless got disable
00:30  KB1JWQ: Joint: What did you change?
00:31  KB1JWQ: Upgrade anything?
00:31  Joint: and now don't know what's going on with it.
00:31  Joint: well yesterday
00:31  Joint: i did a dist-upgrade
00:31  KB1JWQ: Joint: And you didn't think that was worth mentioning in your problem description because...
00:31  Joint: i did say it ;)
00:31  anao: do a lspci and lsmod to show if recognized first
00:31  KB1JWQ: dmesg may also be helpful. :-)
00:32  anao: after upgrades often firmware is missed by the kernel
00:32  Joint: 07:00.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR5001 Wireless Network               Adapter (rev 01
00:32  anao: squeeze and sid uses firmware as packeges for nofree drivers..
00:33  Joint: i'm using sid,
00:33  anao: this results 1000 of discussions on net
00:33  Joint: so how can i re enable my wireless device?
00:33  tharkun: Gentlemen i need to compile some stuff for a server. Which is the best way to do it. Also the cleanest one would be needed. Since after compiling the stuff i want to leave the server as it was before.
00:33  stew: zulax: that's ethernet, not wireless, but the installer would support it
00:34  anao: easy if you have the old kernel on the system
00:34  anao: reboot on old kernel
00:34  Joint: i did reboot
00:34  Joint: a few times
00:34  Joint: and nothing happens
00:34  anao: and install firmware packages with aptitude
00:34  zulax: stew, thanks :)
00:35  stew: Joint: what is the deviceid of your card (lspci -nn would tell you)
00:35  Joint: 07:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Atheros Communications Inc. AR5001 Wireless Network Adapter [168c:001c] (rev 01)
00:35  stew: judd: pciid 168c:001c
00:35  judd: [168c:001c] is 'AR5001 Wireless Network Adapter' from 'Atheros Communications Inc.' with kernel module 'ath5k' in lenny. See also http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=168c:001c http://wiki.debian.org/ath5k and the out-of-tree 'ath_pci' module.
00:35  anao: since squeeze many companys servers stops running net cards after upgrades
00:36  stew: Joint: what does "uname -r" say?
00:36  Joint: 2.6.32-5-amd64
00:36  anao: i hoped the info help you
00:36  dondelelcaro: anao: if you're upgrading a machine which needs firmware, you will be warned if you don't have it installed
00:37  stew: Joint: run "modprobe -r ath5k ; modprobe ath5k" and see what "dmesg | tail" says when the driver is loaded
00:37  anao: in my opinion all netdrivers should be free and inside the kernel
00:37  Joint: let me pastebin the output sterna
00:37  Joint: *stew
00:37  anao: linux without net is nothing value, sorry for my bad english
00:37  dondelelcaro: anao: the drivers all are; the firmware is often not
00:37  tharkun: anao: you have a valid opinion, tell the developers about it ;P
00:37  anao: :-)
00:38  dondelelcaro: we do actually have some cases where we have firmware and the source to build that firmware... but that's fairly rare
00:38  anao: but you all agree newbies ran away from linux if net isn't working..
00:38  Joint: stew, here it is http://pastebin.com/y8DDKeU9
00:39  dondelelcaro: anao: market share isn't Debian's primary concern.
00:39  stew: anao: yes, but our only other alternative is to include the non-free stuff in debian, and given the two alternatives, we'd much rather strive to keep debian 100% free software
00:39  anao: i must close here..coffeebreak..by to all www.linuxonlinehelp.de
00:40  Joint: you saw the paste stew?
00:40  CutMeOwnThroat: I don't understand why the kernel needs firmware, though... that should be running on the card itself and be transparent to the OS, I always thought
00:40  stew: Joint: yes, does "ip l" now show your wireless?
00:40  Joint: 6: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN qlen 1000
00:40  Joint:     link/ether 00:25:56:0b:28:83 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
00:40  tharkun: CutMeOwnThroat: firmware is not persistent through a powerdown.
00:40  Joint: there it is
00:41  tharkun: ram is cheaper that flash or eprom
00:41  CutMeOwnThroat: should be on some eprom
00:41  alteregoa: i need a howto from nonraid to raid1 with mdadm with system disk(s)
00:41  amphi: CutMeOwnThroat: harder to update then
00:42  tharkun: CutMeOwnThroat: some devices have it on eprom, some don't it is indeed a manufacturer choice
00:42  dondelelcaro: CutMeOwnThroat: eproms increase the price point
00:42  Joint: stew, it is there
00:42  tharkun: amphi: if you have the proper logic it is simple to update. But the extra logic to do it incresases the pricetag of the card
00:42  amphi: tharkun: uhuh
00:42  stew: Joint: and n-m still doesn't see it?
00:43 * tharkun has done some hw development
00:43  Joint: huh?
00:44  stew: Joint: are you still having problems with network-manager?
00:44  Joint: yeah
00:44  CutMeOwnThroat: still seems strange to me... doesn't that complicate powering up the device?
00:44  Joint: still i cannot see my wireless
00:44  Joint: it says wlan0 device not ready
00:45  stew: Joint: is it the same after "ip link set wlan0 up" ?
