13:28  Jon2: Hey, would anybody know how to make a script that would allow people to get a free shell on my server by completing an online form?
13:28  Jon2: And it would need to automatically set up the shell for them.
13:29  ravenzz: http://php.net/manual/en/function.system.php
13:29  ravenzz: ?
13:29  RunTimeWorld: Jon2, yes
13:29  i5noc: sigh
13:30  Jon2: RunTimeWorld: How?
13:30  petemc: Jon2: that sounds fairly prone to abuse, fwiw
13:30  Jon2: And are there any scripts already available for it?
13:30  RunTimeWorld: I will send you my paypal account if you wanna hire
13:30  RunTimeWorld: else do research
13:30  HackeMate: hello, i have a problem starting session: there was an error with the config /usr/lib/libgconf2-4/gconf-sanity-check-2 status 256
13:30  Jon2: petemc: I'd probably end up setting something to allow only so many users a day.
13:30  ravenzz: maybe you can
13:30  ravenzz: add a request form
13:31  Jon2: RunTimeWorld: Nah, I don't really want to pay for this, I can probably get someone from my network staff to do it if I don't have the time.
13:31  Jon2: ravenzz: i already have a request form, but it doesn't notify me when a request comes in, I gotta check it every day.
13:31  ravenzz: Jon2 mail()
13:31  ravenzz: ?
13:32  RunTimeWorld: you come with requirements and specs, not with question... sounds like freebie
13:32  RunTimeWorld: my 2 cents
13:32  RunTimeWorld: sorry
13:32  ravenzz: btw google can help you
13:32  Jon2: ravenzz: I don't have a mail server on my network, we use external mail servers
13:32  ravenzz: you can
13:35  ravenzz: http://bit.ly/gJ9OgA
13:35  ravenzz: or write your own mailer function
13:37  ravenzz: i need some help with ddos attacks
13:37  ravenzz: anyone?
13:37  Jon2: Firewalls
13:37  abrotman: ravenzz: you should call your ISP .. if it's reaching your server, you're already screwed
13:38  ravenzz: uhm
13:38  ravenzz: so i'm already screwd!?
13:38  ravenzz: i've not experience with fw
13:39  abrotman: ravenzz: if your firewall is dealing with it, you're consuming bandwidth and system resources
13:39  ravenzz: i've a vps with a webserver and ssh access
13:39  ravenzz: only that 2 services
13:39  ravenzz: i'm already filtering http traffic
13:41  ravenzz: is a good idea to block all incoming traffic and allow only http and ssh one
13:41  ravenzz: ?
13:42  petemc: ravenzz: are you running services other than ssh or http?
13:42  ravenzz: no
13:43  petemc: then what would blocking traffic to non existent services achie e?
13:43  abrotman: ravenzz: how is the DDOS happening? ping? http requests?
13:43  ravenzz: yes what i thing
13:44  ravenzz: abrotman i dont know..
13:44  ravenzz: time ago with http requests
13:44  ravenzz: but now i filter http traffic so i solved that issue
13:45  ravenzz: (sorry for my bad engl)
13:46  abrotman: but you're filtering at the server ...
13:48  ravenzz: added this rules to my fw
13:48  ravenzz: http://pastie.org/1344302
13:48  ravenzz: it saved me from tons of http requests
13:51  abrotman: You're missing the point ...
13:52  ravenzz: you mean.. yes i filter anyway it can overload the server
13:52  ravenzz: ?
13:52  abrotman: Call your ISP, see if they're willing to help you
13:52  ravenzz: mailed the hosting company
13:53  ravenzz: but there is no support
13:53  ravenzz: i've buyed my vps and i've not support for that things

13:59  slingshot316: well
13:59  poisonbit: can I know the preseed options that a package may have, without installing the package ?
13:59  slingshot316: i did

14:02  xyan: so does that chipset support 3d acceleration at all?
14:02  slingshot316: i dont know
14:02  slingshot316: i tried doin glxinfo
14:02  Arrowmaster: i think `glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"`
14:02  slingshot316: it thorws error
14:02  poisonbit: slingshot316, look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log and look for W(arning) and E(rror) lines
14:02  slingshot316: poisonbit: one second
14:02  poisonbit: man intel to know supported chipsets by the driber release
14:03  Arrowmaster: glxinfo throwing errors sounds bad
14:03  poisonbit: yes
14:03  xyan: its supported by the i915 driver see http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/index.rhtmlx?check=1&lspci=8086:2772
14:03  poisonbit: slingshot316, lenny or squeeze ?
14:03  slingshot316: poisonbit: lenny
14:03  poisonbit: in lenny should just works, in squeeze there are notes about KMS
14:03  slingshot316: poisonbit: the log file is huge
14:04  slingshot316: poisonbit: should i send it on paste bin
14:04  slingshot316: ?
14:04  poisonbit: ignore lines starting by I
14:05  poisonbit: you can pastebin of course, someone can read it for you :)
14:05  slingshot316: xyan: i dont know if it supports 3d
14:05  abrotman: the intel card? yes it does
14:06  slingshot316: abrotman: okay

14:50  sec_goat: Here's a fun one: I had to download some ridiculous windows EXE that self extracted a bunch of PDFs, WINE put this on my C:\ . . . how do I find that now?
14:51  nkuttler: sec_goat: man find
14:52  jelly: sec_goat: inspect the contents of $HOME/.wine/
14:52  sec_goat: nkuttler: interesting , thank you
14:52  babilen: sec_goat: ~/.wine/drive_c ? otherwise run winecfg it might tell you
14:52  jelly: sec_goat: also, run winecfg
14:52  Bushmills: check whether windows has an equivalent of dpkg,  then try to use that with option  -L
14:53  babilen: Bushmills: heh, good one ;)
14:53  jelly: Bushmills: that answer is not silly enough.
14:53 * jelly deducts two silliness points from Bushmills.
14:54  Bushmills: sorry, i don't know the windows distribution well enough
14:54  spliffi: hi community, Iam on a Xen Host and wanted to create a new guest, what failed because the max amount of loop devices is reached...I googled a bit and found a couple of solutions. adding a line to /etc/modprobe.conf, adding a boot parameter in grubs config, or using a simple loop which create loop devices with mknod....would like to have it permanent of course. What would be the best solution of the three?
14:54  spliffi: it's debain lenny
14:55  Bushmills: seems it is .exe based, not .deb, but those package tools tend to exist for any type of archive.
14:56  sec_goat: Bushmills:  but whois using Windows?
14:57  abrotman: FWIW, some of those EXE can be unzipped
14:57  Bushmills: google says "a program loader, popular with gamers"
14:58  sec_goat: ok you guys want silly: is there any way to make the system explorer behave mor eliek windows explorer?
14:59  jelly: what is "system explorer", sec_goat?
14:59  sec_goat: jelly: well I click places, then computer then when I navigate to a new folder it opens a new window eeverytime
15:00  sec_goat: I am not sure what the actuall program is called
15:00  dkr: nautilus
15:00  sec_goat: yes, then I want nautilus to be more like its retarded cousin Windows Explorer
15:00  jelly: ah, you want it not to open a separate window for each folder?
15:00  sec_goat: yes
15:01  babilen: spliffi: Looks as if creating a file with the content "loop max_loop=N" in /etc/modprobe.d/ does the trick
15:01  dkr: that's a config option, did you look at the preferences?
15:01  cahoot: you can set that in gconf-editor
15:01  Chris___: this isn't so much specific to Debian as it is just to general linux/internet, but.. my IRC network got nuked with a botnet last night. I got the list of the IP's used, I don't suppose there's some epic search/grep command I can use to automagically look up the abuse@domain emails of each IP and then dump them in a text file for a mass e-mail, is there?
15:02  spliffi: @babilien thx I'll give it a shot
15:03  babilen: spliffi: Make sure that you don't have any loop devices, remove the "loop" module and insert it again ... See http://www.howtoforge.com/virtualization-with-xen-on-debian-lenny-amd64 for other things Debian+Xen
15:04  dkr: Chris___: whois $ip |grep OrgAbuseName  in a loop?
15:04  babilen: spliffi: You have to adjust N to a sensible number (e.g. 64 as suggested)
15:04  ImmerDerBest: hi there .. i'm looking for some debian packager with proposal
15:04  babilen: ImmerDerBest: What?

15:05  spliffi: @ babilen, ok I#ll do that, thx again
15:05  ImmerDerBest: babilen: are you packager? ;)
15:05  babilen: ImmerDerBest: What are you trying to achieve? What if I were, indeed, a Debian Developer/Maintainer?
15:06 * jelly half expects ImmerDerBest to pull out a virtual gun on babilen
15:06  dkr: sec_goat: apps...natuailus..prefs..always_use_browser  is the option, I think
15:06  Chris___: dkr: I had no idea linux had a "whois" command or that it was native to Debian

15:08  dpkg: Request For Package is the way to ask for a piece of software to be included in Debian.  See http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp, the section on that page "Adding new entries with "reportbug"" is a good place to start.  Technically, RFP is a wishlist bug filed against "wnpp" with a title beginning "RFP: ", ask me about <wnpp>.
15:08  ImmerDerBest: ok, thanks
15:09  babilen: ImmerDerBest: If you want someone else to do the packaging file a RFP (/msg dpkg rfp) and wait. If you want to speed-up the process read the New Maintainers Guide and start packaging. You would need a sponsor for your package then. Packaging is supported in #debian-mentors over at irc.oftc.net

16:07  gigo: when i play .mov usng vlcplayer, it just plays sound. no video. how do I fix this?
16:07  babilen: TheNetuno: Read the referenced wiki page, make sure that you install the firmware (/msg dpkg iwlagn firmware) and decide how you want to configure your wireless. See http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse for your options
16:09  TheNetuno: [babilen] Many thanks go to that
16:10  babilen: TheNetuno: You are welcome -- Let me know if you run into problems. I would suggest to either use WICD or NetworkManager if you have a laptop and need to switch networks frequently. If this is a rather static setup you can just configure it in /etc/network/interfaces
16:17  manu_hack: hi, i want to use the split function, read the manual, i dont seem to find a way to output the file in another directory, because i dont have enough space for the output, any pointer?
16:20  xingu: manu_hack: split somefile /path/to/other/dir/prefix. ?
16:22  manu_hack: xingu: alright, so PREFIX actually can be a path
16:22  manu_hack: thx xingu
16:22  xingu:  manu_hack: try it anyway, who knows
16:22  manu_hack: xingu: tried and it works, thanks
16:23  yurik: Hi there. I'm trying to install nginx from backports. aptitude  -t backports install  nginx    doesn't work.
16:23  karlpinc: babilen: I hear networkmanager is buggy.  How is wicd on lenny (and squeeze)?
16:23  yurik: what's the correct way of forcing backport priority?
16:24  karlpinc: yurik: -t lenny-backports  (iirc)
16:24  babilen: karlpinc: wicd is working great on lenny (from backports) and on Squeeze. The only thing it does not support are 3G modems
16:25  karlpinc: yurik: http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/
16:25  babilen: yurik: "-t lenny-backports" iirc
16:25  karlpinc: babilen: I'll have to give it a whirl.  I've never actually got wireless to work (and don't know if it's a hardware problem) although I've not tried too hard.
16:26  babilen: karlpinc: If you want to try harder let me know :)
16:27  abrotman: karlpinc: n-m can be buggy .. i have random hangs/disconnects .. i'm really not sure if it's n-m or the iwlwifi/agn driver
16:30  yurik: well indeed it's named lenny-backports
16:30  karlpinc: I've always tried using the interfaces file, and diagnostics from the command line.
16:30  yurik: strange that someone right in this channel suggested -t backports some day
16:31  yurik: thanks, it helped
16:40  dkr: I seem to be blind.  can't find where in icedove you add a new address to send mail from(as opposed to a new account).  it was called "profile" or something like that? (have to reply to a sender address verification request for an account alias rather than my own)
16:42  fbs: dkr: edit-> accountsettings?
16:43  dkr: ah, the term is "identities" according to icedove kb, but still can't find the option in account settings
16:43  dkr: ah, there it is.  at top level. me brain dead.  thanks

16:45 --- netol_ is now known as netol
16:47  fbs: lets say i want to encrypt my /home t/mp and swap. Is it smart to make a lvm with 1 encrypted partition in it (and the rest  like /root) and create another lvm in the encrypted partition
16:47  fbs: or just make 2 different partitions, and give them a seperate lvm
16:47  khem_: is there a debian package for libx264?
16:49  fbs: khem_: look for debian multimedia
16:49  fbs: on google
16:49  roe: can anyone recommend a good graphical ldap browser that is packaged?
16:50  pipeline: fbs: there's really no reason not to encrypt all of your lvm
16:51  pipeline: roe: unfortunately the best graphical ldap browsers I know of are not packaged .. both are java, so all you need is openjdk or sun-java6*
16:51  pipeline: roe: I can recommend jxplorer and apache studio
16:51  roe: pipeline, yea, the apache studio seems lke a good one
16:52  pipeline: I am very font of apache studio
16:52  fbs: pipeline: imo its easier to make 1 partition with a lvm than making 3 seperate encrypted partitions
16:52  pipeline: apacheds seems really promising, too, but I haven't had an opportunity to put it into production :(
16:52  pipeline: fbs: that's what I mean -- have a /boot, then put root, swap, home etc all on a single encrypted lvm
16:52  pipeline: fbs: the debian installer will even do it for you, it's one of the preset options
16:53  fbs: pipeline: but i dont want to encrypt /root
16:53  pipeline: fbs: why not ?
16:53  fbs: why would i?
16:53  fbs: i dont think i need it
16:53  pipeline: fbs: protect sensitive data -- /etc/shadow, log files -- prevent tampering
16:53  fbs: hmm
16:53  pipeline: fbs: it costs you basically nothing to do, and the potential upsides are considerable
16:54  pipeline: fbs: it's also way simpler to encrypt *everything* than to encrypt some things but not others :P
16:54  pipeline: fbs: for example, you *definitely* want to encrypt swap to prevent people reading sensitive data from memory
16:54  pipeline: fbs: so at the very least you're gonna be doing swap, home, and tmp on encrypted lvm... why not just go whole hog and get some additional protection at almost no penalty
16:55  fbs: yeah maybe
16:55  pipeline: fbs: the thing to keep in mind about encryption is that the latency penalty is to total latency, not seek latency... your overall disk i/o will be unchanged, just slightly delayed
16:55  pipeline: fbs: you'll have the same number of iops, they'll just be a tiny bit delayed :P
16:55  fbs: true, i was just wondering if its possible to make a lvm in a lvm
16:55  pipeline: fbs: I've never tried it, and I wouldn't recommend it :P
16:56  fbs: :P
16:57  TimmyT: I was compiling Linux-2.6.32 on debian5. After an hour I have gotten this error: http://pastebin.com/Z0cgqg2Z. What is the problem?
16:58  pipeline: a major reason that I like having encrypted lvm is that it means my coworkers can't boot knoppix, install a "toor" uid0 account, and prank me >:(
16:58  pipeline: encrypted filesystems don't just prevent read access, they prevent tampering
17:01  TimmyT:  I was compiling Linux-2.6.32 on debian5. After an hour I have gotten this error: http://pastebin.com/Z0cgqg2Z. What is the problem?
17:01  stew: its certainly possible to do an lvm in an lvm.  i do it for my virtual machines.  each machine gets a lv, which it then uses as a pv and creates lvs for swap/root/etc
17:01  tharkun: Gentlemen good evening, I've been managing several servers with cronjobs and custom scripts, Is there a more automated way of doing that? Like some program to administer security updates and upgrades on an automated basis?
17:02  petemc: stew: doesnt that have an effect on performance?
17:02  dutchfish: tharkun: http://fai-project.org/
17:02  stew: tharkun: have you looked at puppet?  its a commitment, but can be worth it, especially if you have lots of similarly configured machine
17:03  TimmyT:  I was compiling Linux-2.6.32 on debian5. After an hour I have gotten this error: http://pastebin.com/Z0cgqg2Z. What is the problem?
17:03  stew: petemc: i don't understand the overhead of lvm to be much at all
17:03  petemc: what advantages does double lvm offer you?
17:04  catsup: the advantage is being able to manage partitions in the vm
17:05  petemc: you can do that without the second layer of lvm
17:05  tharkun: dutchfish: sounds interesting
17:05  catsup: you mean give the VMs real partitions?
17:05  catsup: there's no need for real partitions anymore
17:06  petemc: lvs, which the vm sees as partitions
17:06  dutchfish: tharkun: if puppet or fai is intresting depends on numbers, but it very worth to dig in by reading
17:06  catsup: petemc: yeah, then you can't, within the vm, create/change lvs
17:07  tharkun: stew: problem is configuratios of this bunch is very disimilar
17:07  tharkun: dutchfish: you are certainly right, The bigger the network the deeper the commit and the greater the benefits
17:08  dutchfish: tharkun: bingo
17:08  fbs: pipeline: currently i dont have /root encrypted
17:08  fbs: maybe next time
17:08  fbs: al the real important stuff is in /home or /data, and those are encrypted

17:10  dutchfish: tharkun: for that i use pxe boot envirenments and auto-configure scripting

17:11  dutchfish: s/ost/most
17:13  pipeline: petemc, stew : there's practically no overhead to lvm
17:14  tharkun: At this moment installation of more workstations is not the problem. Since the rate of those is fairly low. But maintaining them is becoming a burden. Virtualization is out of the question since most of the workstations have not the most recent hardware ;P
17:14  frikinz: TimmyT: http://wiki.debian.org/Lguest  "lguest was tested on DebianSqueeze, using kernel 2.6.30-2-686. Other releases and kernel seems to have problems". So you should remove the CONFIG option to build a test hypervisor

17:23  fbs: when creating a ext3/4 partition, is the j needed or optional
17:23  fbs: so, mkfs.ext4 /dev/bla, does the -j have a influence?
17:24  karlpinc: fbs: It does not need to be on a separate device.  If you don't have a -j you get ext2.
17:24  karlpinc: fbs: (But that's with ext3 and mke2fs)  Dunno about the wrappers like mkfs.ext3 etc.)
17:24  fbs: ah ok

17:35  atula: Iridos: meaning? which one should I use :P
17:35  gigo: also i do not see the corresponding device in /dev/ directory so that i can mount it manually?
17:37  Iridos: atula, use what you like... autoremove removes packages that were tagged as installed automatically, i.e. not on request... deborphan tries to fine libraries that are not used ... roughly by looking for lib* packages that nothing depends on
17:38  Iridos: !tell atula -about autoremove
17:38  atula: cool. thank you
17:38  Iridos: !tell atula -about deborphan

18:48  jhutchins_lt: haxi__: We don't seem to be getting much of a dialog here.  Hard to help if you don't respond.  You could try the regular installation CD, get a basic system up and running with that.
18:48  nsadmin: haxi__, do you have supported network hardware?
18:49  nsadmin: you could try going thru the netinst and see if your net is detected

18:50  haxi__: jhutchins_lt: I respond. Is it possible to burn and boot on a minimal install, configure wifi things and then install all things needed?

18:59 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 924]
18:59  robert45: jhutchins_lt the thing is the server is on a datacenter. I was thinking to install the memtest with apt-get and get the tech guys at the colo to reboot it and run it from there
18:59  robert45: jhutchins_lt hm, I dont think so. Could that cause any issues?
18:59  jhutchins_lt: robert45: Not cause, possibly reveal.
19:00  robert45: ok, I will have the tech guys to check this out and run memtest, any other advice?
19:00  pipeline: petemc, stew : here's the key thing about lvm and other manipulations: disk is three orders of magnitude slower than memory.  You can do the most obscenely expensive, overcomplicated things you want in memory -- when it comes time to actually put the bits on a disk, all of that redirection's cost is a squirrel's sneeze in a blizzard
19:02  jhutchins_lt: robert45: Just that sometimes if you unplug everything and plug it back in it'll fix things.

19:13  goose: I just don't want to push Pandora's bandwidth through my server
19:14  pipeline: goose: clearly it doesn't, because you want a split tunnel but that's not what you have

19:18  whkkl: i know how to setup a chroot, but updating the binaries inside the chroot with apt-get is difficult
19:18  pipeline: whkkl: that's not the kind of environment for which a tutorial is appropriate
19:18  pipeline: whkkl: if you require that kind of security, you should know what you're doing.  Hire an expert.

19:18  whkkl: pipeline, tutorial is perhaps the wrong word
19:18  pipeline: goose: No.
19:18  whkkl: pipeline, i just want to know how it's usually done
19:18  pipeline: chrisb: No.
19:18  chrisb: i have doubles of smbd, nmdb, apache winbindd
19:18  pipeline: whkkl: for php hosting specifically, commercial off-the-shelf products
19:19  pipeline: chrisb: most UNIX daemons fork to handle concurrency
19:19  pipeline: chrisb: so if you have the daemon running, and you have one client, you probably have two smbd processes
19:20  chrisb: pipeline: so the one servicing the client and one ready for the next client
19:20  pipeline: chrisb: however... I don't think winbindd specificially works that way... try stopping the samba service and see if some of those processes stick around.. you may have zombies, or accidentally started the srevice twice (broken lock ?)
19:20  pipeline: chrisb: yeah smbd is definitely a forking server that works that way.  I don't think winbind is... I'm not 100% sure.
19:21  chrisb: pipeline: yesterday when i did a console login on the serial port, i had one login session, and one login session of 0 time length, again, it looked like two gettys answering on the same port
19:22  chrisb: pipeline: so now i'm looking at everything
19:22  chrisb: pipeline: for strangeness
19:22  chrisb: pipeline: like was my root password echoed to another getty session that stopped right after the other one succeeded
19:23  chrisb: pipeline: same with the smbd stuff, there are passwords passed

19:27  chrisb: pipeline: but the winbindd processes continue
19:27  pipeline: chrisb: and I was just wrong
19:27  pipeline: chrisb: winbindd is a separate init script

20:22  Rienzilla: writing something in munin.conf is not enough
20:22  Rienzilla: munin will make two graphs if you have two plugins on two different hosts
20:23  bintut: basically my objective is, i want to have a line graph - in a single graph - for all the web servers
20:23  Rienzilla: then you have to make a plugin which will return the values for all the webservers

20:31  digatech: So, I type: sudo crontab -e
20:32  digatech: * * * * * /usr/local/bin/indexer -c /usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf --rotate --all >> /home/olympus/rotate2.log

20:33  digatech: * * * * * == every minute right?
20:34  digatech: *sigh*
20:34  jhutchins_lt: digatech: sudo abuse.
20:34  stew: superstraw: . is a wildcard, it matches any character, supported by both grep and egrep.  the * after it means that there will be zero or more occurances

20:35  stew: digatech: does /usr/local/b8in/indexer rely on something in your environment that wouldn't be set in the crontab environment?
20:35  stew: jhutchins_lt: do what?
20:36  digatech: not sure
20:36  digatech: how would I check that?
20:36  digatech: it's just a single string, it doesn't rely on anything
20:36  stew: digatech: the script is just a single sring?
20:36  digatech: yea, it does't need anything to run
20:37  stew: digatech: what is the string?

20:37  stew: oh, i thought you meant the contents of indexer
20:37  digatech: I need that to run every one minute

21:46  panfist: is it possible to list packages which have been selected for manual installation through apt?
21:46  stew: FilipeMaia: oh, hmm, perhaps I dont' know the correct answer for emacs
21:46  stew: FilipeMaia: check with #emacs perhaps
21:47  FilipeMaia: stew: thanks for all the help. I will
21:47  bytenik__: hi -- i have a package with a missing dependency, and i know the package will work without it. i forced it to install with dpkg, but now apt-get refuses to do anything without first resolving the missing dependency
21:47  bytenik__: is there a way to get apt to ignore the dependency
21:47 --- bytenik__ is now known as bytenik
21:47  stew: panfist: yeah, aptitude search '~i!~M'
21:48  stew: panfist: well those are ones installed and marked manual, it wouldn't include ones marked for manual install but not yet installed
21:49 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 936]
21:49  Iridos: bytenik, no, only if it's a recommend... else you can only repackage the package with different dependencies and possibly file a bugreport
21:49  panfist: thanks stew
21:49  stew: bytenik: no, but look at /msg dpkg equivs
21:49  subsume: if I use screen to have a terminal open in another server, does the original server hang for any reason on processes running in the screen instance?
21:49  bytenik: how difficult is a repackage like that?
21:49  jhutchins_lt: There's a way to trick dpkg into thinking the package is installed.
21:49  stew: bytenik: is this a debian package?
21:50  bytenik: yea, its hamachi2, but i'm on a readynas which still runs debian edge
21:50  stew: there is no reason to trick dpkg
21:50  bytenik: so it wants lso
21:50  bytenik: which has a million dependencies i don't want to give it
21:50  stew: bytenik: i ask because if this is a pacakging error, a bug should be filed
21:50  bytenik: and the only reason it wants lso is to be able to register for start-on-boot, which i can do on my own
21:50  panfist: stew so the search pattern that you gave me basically says to search for packages that are installed and not packages that are automatically installed
21:50  bytenik: so the package is not "necessary" even if it is
21:50  stew: panfist: yes
21:51  panfist: thanks!
21:51  stew: bytenik: you want equivs
21:51  bytenik: equivs?
21:51  stew: bytenik: if you thihk this could be downgraded to a Recommends (which would not be strictly required) consider filing a bug
21:51  stew: bytenik: yes
21:52  jhutchins_lt: .
21:53  bytenik: no dice
21:53  stew: bytenik: what do you mean?
21:53  bytenik: it still says it depends on lsb and won't install
21:54  stew: bytenik: did you already build a lsb package which equivs?
21:54  stew: ^which^with
21:54  stew: bytenik: did you read "/msg dpkg equivs" ?
21:56  bytenik: no i didn't, i thought you meant equivs would provide the dep
21:56  bytenik: one sec
21:58  stonie_: stew, thanks that rename worked fine, except when prefix is a $VARIABLE .. how can i solve that?
22:00  stew: stonie_: use double quotes instead of single quotes
22:01  stew: stonie_: the single quotes in my example would tell your shell not to try to mess with the quoted contents
22:01  stonie_: for the whole command? or only 's/^/"$prefix"/'
22:01  stew: stonie_: anything that is in single quotes will be ignored by the shell, so that won't work,  i meant replace the single quotes with double quotes
22:01  stonie_: ok thanks ill try
22:02  stew: stonie_: in reality, in this case, the quotes are not at all necessary
22:10  bytenik: stew: I built a package called lsb-dummy with a provides: lsb
22:10  bytenik: stew: it still thinks its missing
22:11  bytenik: wait nevermind, i left Provides commented. :-)
22:11  stew: bytenik: is it a versioned dependency?
22:11  bytenik: stew: yea
22:11  stew: then you can't use provides
22:11  bytenik: oh
22:11  bytenik: so i have to actually pretend to be it
22:11  stew: yes, there is no way to do a "versioned provides"
22:12  stew: (this does, btw beg the question of why not just install lsb)
22:12  bytenik: stew: lsb seems to have another 15 deps
22:13  Jon2: Hey, anyone have a script I could use to put a form on my website that allows users to get a shell? It needs ti automatically setup the shell for them.
22:13  bytenik: stew: including x11-base
22:13  stew: yes
22:13  stonie_: stew, doesnt work :(
22:14  bytenik: that's a lot of stuff for an embedded system. :-p
22:14  stew: stonie_: show us the exact command
22:14  bytenik: YES, success
22:14  bytenik: thank you very much
22:14  stew: cool :)
22:14  stonie_: rename "s/^/$BASENAME-/" $ATTACHMENT where $ATTACHMENT is the list of files
22:15  stew: stonie_: and what is the contents of BASENAME ?
22:15  stonie_: with full path
22:15  stonie_: 20101201-38652-test
22:15  stew: do you get an error?
22:16  stonie_: lets see.. i ran it via cron..sec
22:17  stonie_: may take a min because i got a check if BASENAME is older than one min
22:17  Jon2: Hey, anyone have a script I could use to put a form on my website that allows users to get a shell? It needs ti automatically setup the shell for them.
22:20  stonie_: this is the error
22:21  stew: stonie_: oh, right, its treating $ATTACHMENT as a single filename
22:22  stonie_: then with a for i in $ATTACHEMENT loop?
22:24  stew: stonie_: or use an array, or use something goofy like $(echo $ATTACHMENT)
22:25  doughj3: I hope this isn't a stupid question, but why are there 30 CD isos in this directory? http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.7/i386/iso-cd/
22:25  doughj3: Do I need them all to install debian? I wouldn't think so, but I'm also not sure why there are 30...
22:26  petemc: doughj3: debian has a lot od packages, you only need the first one or even a small netinstall disc to install from
22:26  doughj3: CD-1.iso should work if I don't have a net connection?
22:26  petemc: yes
22:26  doughj3: Awesome, thanks! I've always used debian on a VPS where installation was handled for me, now putting it on a local box.
22:28  Jon2: Does anyone have a script I could use to put a form on my website that allows users to get a shell? It needs ti automatically setup the shell for them.
22:28  jhutchins: 30 CDs include all the internationalization of some 30,000 packages.
22:28  abrotman: you didn't write it yet? you've been asking since yesterday?
22:28  abrotman: oh, this morning
22:29  Jon2: abrotman: yeah, I've been at school.
22:29  stew: !tell Jon2 about repeat
22:29  abrotman: Yeah, well, one of two things are going to happen .. you're going to get setup with some sort of automated crap, or you're going to reap passwords .. no thanks
22:29  Jon2: I need help with it since I have no clue how to code php.
22:29  stew: (and btw, it sounds like what you are trying to do is asking for trouble)
22:30  stew: that makes it really sound like you are asking for trouble
22:30  Jon2: stew: I plan on restricting it to registered IRC users or something
22:30  doughj3: Jon2
22:30  abrotman: Jon2: then perhaps ask ##php and offer to pay someone
22:30  abrotman: It really has nothing to do with Debian
22:30  doughj3: Jon2: Have you looked into mindterm? I don't know if that's what you're looking for...
22:30  Jon2: I'm a student, you really think I have the kind of money to pay to have it done? =P
22:30  abrotman: If you're a student, you have free time to learn how
22:30  Jon2: Not much
22:31  doughj3: @google mindterm
22:31  abrotman: you're doing something wrong
22:31  jhutchins: The terms "web shell" return 57,800,000 hits on google.
22:31  abrotman: And it still has nothing to do with Debian .. go ask google, or ask ##php to volunteer time to write it for you
22:31  Jon2: Does mindterm create shell users?
22:31  stew: a good sign that thats a bad search term
22:32  jhutchins: How do I turn on this light switch?
22:32  jhutchins: stew: Actually, several useful hits on top.
22:32  SparFux: Hi all. In logrotate, using dateext and dateformat makes my logfile turn round 2 times: first with the old daemon.log.<number>.gz way and shortly after with the date format! I don't want the <number> thing. How to turn it ioff?
22:32  stew: jhutchins: but not useful to him
22:32  jhutchins: stew: They would be if he read them.
22:33  stew: jhutchins: not at all
22:33  stew: jhutchins: which would help him create a php script that does adduser?
22:33 * jhutchins suspects he's lost another thread...
22:33  nsadmin: google would certainly help him find it
22:33 --- Jon2 is now known as JonSparks
22:34  abrotman: oh i know .. he could ask ##php
22:34  benji_: Hi, do you know how to use find to match *.xml and *.properties ? :)
22:34  SparFux: Ah, I know, it's because of /usr/sbin/syslogd-listfiles --weekly in cron.
22:34  jhutchins: !webmin
22:34  dpkg: Webmin is a lame web-based interface for unsafe system administration for Unix.  Check it out at http://webmin.com/  Remember, dondelelcaro *hates* webmin.  "i'd rather sit on the floor shoving table knives into live electrical outlets than run webmin on an exposed server."  See http://bugs.debian.org/343897 about the removal from Debian.  Don't use their .debs, they are of extremely poor quality.  See <free whcp> for alternatives.
22:34  abrotman: benji_: IIRC find can take two --name arguments
22:34  benji_: abrotman, thank you!
22:34  doughj3: What's wrong with webmin? :[
22:34  abrotman: so many things
22:36  nsadmin: JonSparks, the area you're getting into is one that has security implications...
22:36  nsadmin: adduser, for example, needs to be run as root
22:36  nsadmin: and usually web servers do not
22:37  benji_: find . \( -name "*.xml" -o -name "*.properties" \)   :)
22:37  JonSparks: nsadmin: Would it work through a sudoer?
22:37  doughj3: cron runs as root
22:37  doughj3: could have a crun script which gets info from the webserver to adduser.
22:38  doughj3: This doesn't seem like a great idea, though.
22:38  nsadmin: which means either that your script would somehow have to run as root but in an env where it's another user (BAD idea) or make a copy of adduser that itself is setuid root (BAD idea)
22:38  JonSparks: $user = $_POST[user_name];
22:38  JonSparks: $password = $_POST[password];
22:38  JonSparks: passthru ("su -");
22:38  JonSparks: passthru ("root's password");
22:38  JonSparks: passthru ("useradd $user -p $password" );
22:38 <-- debhelper has kicked JonSparks from #debian (use http://paste.debian.net or /msg dpkg paste)
22:38  JonSparks: -_-
22:39  nsadmin: well yeah, actually you'd use useradd since adduser is interactive
22:39  CissWit: JonSparks: this way, you avoid all benefits of having your webserver not running as root
22:39  stew: there is so much wrong with that...
22:39  nsadmin: yes, you're right
22:40  SparFux: "Note that logrotate is not the only log rotation program on a typical Debian system. sysklogd uses its own log rotation scripts which can be found in /etc/cron.daily/sysklogd and /etc/cron.weekly/sysklogd" Which one am I supposed to change if special requirements are there for /var/log/messages?
22:40  nsadmin: stew: like we can stop him from doing it
22:40  nsadmin: well let's see.
22:40  nsadmin: JonSparks, why are you doing this?
22:40  JonSparks: CissWit: I don't mind that, I have my server setup only to allow my IP to connect as root. And the server's main IP.
22:41  SparFux: Wouldn't it be better for the logrotate package to take over all log rotating?
22:41  JonSparks: nsadmin: because I give out shells to my friends to tunnel and would rather give them a link for it than manually do it
22:41  CissWit: JonSparks: if you don't mind, just run your webserver as root.
22:42  JonSparks: Then what would I do after that?
22:42  khem_: what debian package contains make: dh_testdir: Command not found ?
22:42  nsadmin: anyth9ing you want
22:42  khem_: dh_testdir ?
22:42  nsadmin: debhelper
22:42  JonSparks: How would running as root let me run a script when I don;t have a script?
22:42  khem_: thankyu sir
22:42  nsadmin: you might also want build-essential
22:43  nsadmin: you're going to have to write it
22:43  JonSparks: I can't write php
22:43  nsadmin: "can't" is meaningless.
22:43  nsadmin: either you choose not to, or you don't know how.
22:43  JonSparks: I don;t have the time to learn.
22:43  nsadmin: then you would need to engage someone who does know
22:44  nsadmin: which may or may not involve money changing hands.
22:45  nsadmin: for example... I'm not going to learn php just because you don't want to
22:45  Kamping_Kaiser: if you're taking crazy pills do it properly and run a shell script in cgi (and no, dont do that at home kids)
22:46  nsadmin: don't do it at home... do it in the dorm...
22:47  nsadmin: JonSparks, what are they going to tunnel thru?
22:47  keith4: how do I set apt to automatically pull in new versions of packages that I have installed from lenny-backports?
22:49  Iridos: you don't need a shell to tunnel...
22:49  Iridos: can be /bin/false or something, it seems
22:49  keith4: sounds like he wants a web-based proxy, no?
22:50  keith4: (I haven't read up all the way)
22:52  stew: keith4: see the instructions page a backports.debian.org
22:52  keith4: stew: i was just reading that... does it *have* to be /etc/apt/preferences, or could it be in apt.conf.d? the instructions sort of trail off before the colon
22:53  keith4: (in that it says "either in ....", but then doesn't offer an alternative
22:54  Iridos: keith4, I think he never asked the <real question> at all... just this crazy stuff about turning your machine into a spamthowing garbage pit.. and the only thing that shines some light on it was  <JonSparks> nsadmin: because I give out shells to my friends to tunnel and would rather give them a link for it than manually do it
22:54  jhutchins: keith4: preferences works.
22:55  keith4: Iridos: so he wants a web-accessible account-creation script? that's some serious insanity
22:55  keith4: jhutchins: right, but I was hoping to toss it in apt.conf.d
22:56  nsadmin: I'd say his best bet is to write something for his iphone or android
22:56  jhutchins: keith4: So try it.
22:58  keith4: doesn't seem to work. the pinning snippet seems to be a different syntax than other things in apt.conf.d. oh well
22:58  nsadmin: two things have me not wanting to deal with him... first off, the idea of the spamfactory that he's potentially creating, and second, he's lazy and doesn't take responsibility for it
22:59  nsadmin: he can be lazy and pay someone to save him the time
22:59  nsadmin: then he'd be taking responsibility
22:59  Iridos: well, time is money...
22:59  Iridos: which means when you're a 100 years old, you're very rich
22:59  nsadmin: no, but time can be traded for money
23:00  nsadmin: heh, how many poor old people do you know? time is not money unless work is done to set it up
23:01 * DiscordianUK is very old
23:01  DiscordianUK: and poor
23:02  Iridos: "rich in years"
23:02  raven737: Hi i am trying to rsync a 4.6G file but it just freezes/hangs at 4820318800 with 98%... what is going on?
23:02  nsadmin: well, anything you think about expands... so think about $$$ :)
23:03  CissWit: raven737: do you rsync on a fat system ?
23:03  raven737: CissWit: no it is xfs on both systems
23:03  nsadmin: enough room?
23:04  raven737: nsadmin: ops... thank you!
23:04 --- JonSparks is now known as JonSparks[AFK]
23:07  SparFux: What's so bad to have logrotate manage *all* the log files?
23:08  SparFux: Why does debian use a complicated parsing script for the /etc/syslog.conf for the syslogd logfilles in which I don't even can handle how often to rotate stuff?
23:09  jhutchins: SparFux: Because Debian is just a collection of software written by many different project developers.  They coordinate it as well as they can, but some people just have to be different.
23:17  SparFux: jhutchins: there are posts from 2006 concerning this issue. The bad thing is, it's really easy to screw you whole logging data by having two control machanisms competing for sysklogd files :-(
23:19  SparFux: jhutchins: I am different. I want logfiles with no numbers 1 2 3 4, but with iso date 2010-12-03 appended and stored forever until I delete to have data for court in case I get busted for copyright infringement :-P
23:23  ehaupt: is there any compat lib i could install for "`GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found"?
23:23  ehaupt: it's an old binary i need to get running
23:25  pipeline: ehaupt: backwards compatibility isn't pretty on linux.  There are other steps you could take to get it running, but I suggest you cut to the chase and get an older version of linux up and running in a VM.
23:25  pipeline: ehaupt: out of the 40-odd isv packages I have for linux from the 90s and 00s, only about 5 of them will run on my 2.6.32 system.
23:25  pipeline: ehaupt: ...and that's with often-extensive tweaking.
23:25  pipeline: ehaupt: you're better off to virtualize now and not even bother with tweking shit
23:26  ehaupt: normally i'd agree funny thing is, tried it in a ubuntu 10.10 image and it just works somehow
23:28  DrEpsas: hello -- I am trying to install java apps -- but am having problems installing the sun-java6-jre packag
23:28  DrEpsas: openjdk-6-jre is the same thing, or different?
23:29  DrEpsas: and would I be able to use that to satisfy the dependency?
23:29  DrEpsas: is this mic on?
23:29  DrEpsas: :)
23:30  freeone3000: It will satisfy the depend, and it should be compatible, but Oracle screwed up with the OpenJDK release, and there's a few random crashes in some high profile apps like IDEA and Tomcat.
23:30  Boohemian: how do i give a specific user access to /var/www/ and all it's subdir's and files?
23:30  pipeline: Boohemian: the simplest way is to add the user to the group that owns /var/www
23:30  pipeline: Boohemian: commonly the "www" group
23:31  pipeline: Boohemian: if you want to get fancy and have multiple groups etc, you'll need to learn how to use acls (google getfacl / setfacl)
23:31  DrEpsas: freeone3000 - I still get   liblucene2-java: Depends: sun-java5-jre which is a virtual package. or
23:31  Boohemian: pipeline: with chmod? it's www-data that owns /var/www/*
23:32  pipeline: Boohemian: then add your user to the www-data group.  You don't need to chmod anything.
23:33  Bushmills: may have to chmod g+w
23:33  freeone3000: DrEpsas: Okay. That's a mess-up in the packaging. A java6 depend, in an ideal world, would also provide java5, java4, and so on, back through time. It doesn't, the same way that glibc4.2 doesn't provide glibc3.2. Your best bet is to install lucene through the normal means of Java dependency resolution (maven, ant ivy, or standard classpath). If you're installing a Java app through apt, I believe there may be a java5 package available on
23:33  freeone3000: backports.
23:34  DrEpsas: freeone3000 - ahh, i found out that i spelled "non-fre" in the apt sources :)
23:34  DrEpsas: now I have the dependencies coming in through apt
23:34  freeone3000: Odd lucene would depend on a specific version rather than just 'java2'.
