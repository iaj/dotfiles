00:59  drasko: hmm... lsof | grep jack gives nothing...
00:59  Vorbote: drasko, are you using pulseaudio?
00:59  amphi: drasko: it may something using /dev/mixer (alsa-oss)
01:00  drasko: I am using alsa
01:00  amphi: drasko: that's the only thing that gives me such problems
01:00  amphi: drasko: is snd_pcm_oss loaded? and if so, is /dev/mixer in use?
01:00  drasko: amphi, how to check that ?
01:01  amphi: lsmod | grep oss
01:01  simonrvn: try looking in /dev/snd
01:01  drasko: Marx:/home/drasko# lsmod | grep snd_pcm_os
01:01  drasko: snd_pcm_oss            28671  0
01:01  amphi: is anything using /dev/mixer? I don't recall other oss devices
01:01  drasko: amphi, hoe to check that ? With lsof ?
01:02  amphi: yes, or fuser
01:03  drasko: Marx:/home/drasko# fuser /dev/mixer
01:03  drasko: no results
01:03  drasko: so, no body uses it
01:04  simonrvn: maybe you got a stray jackd stuck on it
01:04  simonrvn: and alsa stuff (non-oss emu.) is going to be in /dev/snd
01:05  drasko: found it. I had an opened Google Chrome session...
01:05  drasko: Closing browser, jack can be started
01:05  drasko: weird
01:10  amphi: drasko: I bet it had /dev/mixer or some oss-emulation device open; if you remove snd_pcm_oss I expect this will not happen

02:39  little_hacksaw: know anything about mouse button emulation?
02:39  tra_: emul with kbd?
02:39  little_hacksaw: nope, running openbox
02:39  little_hacksaw: emulation through sysctl
02:39  little_hacksaw: i know what _should_ work
02:40  little_hacksaw: but I'm missing some files that the rest of the world seems to just.... _have_
02:40  tra_: what exactly does sysctl do?
02:40  amphi: little_hacksaw: I did it long ago on a g4 ibook; there were good guides at linux-laptop.net if I recall correctly
02:40  amphi: little_hacksaw: there may be some module you need to modprobe, I forget
02:41  little_hacksaw: amphi: yeah I suspect that's true...
02:41  little_hacksaw: i'm missing /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid
02:41  little_hacksaw: is there way to tell what kernel options a pre-built kernel has?
02:42  amphi: huh, I have it here, on an intel laptop ;)
02:42  little_hacksaw: tra_: ummm... tbh i'm not exactly sure, following orders from here http://wiki.debian.org/MacBook#Kernellevelemulation

02:44  little_hacksaw: blank
02:44  tra_: "wir"? "siyh"?
02:44  amphi: little_hacksaw: so it's not set in that kernel, for some reason
02:44  little_hacksaw: that's a tad bollocks, bother.
02:45  amphi: annoying to have to build your own kernel for that; can you update to squeeze?
02:45  ddalton: anyone?
02:45  little_hacksaw: i guess so -- i also have a 2.6.26 on my lappy i can check -- it didn't seem to have it either which is *really* weird
02:46  little_hacksaw: it was the stock lenny intel kernel; the stock lenny ppc kernel definitely had it
02:46  dvs: ddalton: why are you compiling those drivers?
02:47  little_hacksaw: amphi: grep CONFIG_MAC_EMUMOUSEBT /boot/config-2.6.26-2-686 also comes up blank...
02:47  ddalton: dvs: I can't connect to wpa2 enterprise networks with my wifi, and  it drops out a lot on wpa1
02:49  dvs: ddalton: And http://wiki.debian.org/ath9k didn't work?
02:49  little_hacksaw: amphi: maybe I'll just wait for squeeze to come out, I can wait a month or two
02:49  ddalton: havent seen that actually
02:49  amphi: little_hacksaw: dunno; maybe it's not in lenny intel kernels
02:49  ddalton: dvs: will have a look
02:49  amphi: little_hacksaw: is this a server? if it's a personal machine, squeeze is working well
02:50  little_hacksaw: it is my personal machine
02:50  little_hacksaw: yeah i guess i can just give it a whirl
02:50  amphi: little_hacksaw: not much reason not to upgrade IMHO
02:50  little_hacksaw: yeah fair enough, after all I am ex-gentoo, ex-debian testing
02:51  little_hacksaw: not a hacker but happy to fool around and dig myself down the rabbit hole
02:53  little_hacksaw: awright, thanks for your help amphi, i'ma make this space free
02:53  ddalton: aptitude update && aptitude install wireless-tools
02:53  ddalton: oops sorry
02:53  ddalton: dvs: well all that appeared to be done on my system and the driver is present, but i think perhaps it's out of date?
02:54  dvs: ddalton: what's out of date?
02:54  ddalton: dvs: well the driver in 2.6.32 doesn't seem to work with wpa2 for me. is it worth me trying the later version from compat-wireless sources?
02:55  dvs: ddalton: What are you using? lenny?
02:55 --- Crisco is now known as zz_Crisco
02:55  ddalton: squeeze
02:56  dvs: ddalton: You could try but the instructions on the wiki worked for me.
02:57  ddalton: dvs: yes, the drivers are installed like I said and the device is working as expected (I'm using it now), but it won't work at school on the wpa2 enterprise network, and sometimes drops out at home on wpa
02:57  ddalton: dvs: so I'm assuming there is a problem with the driver I have installed, possibly an update may correct it?
02:58  dvs: ddalton: I'm not sure what it could be.  I thought it was a setup problem
02:58  ddalton: dvs: No, the driver comes with squeeze and works out of the box. only requiring wireless-tools, which I of course had installed.
02:59 --- debhelper sets modes [#debian +l 807]
03:01  ddalton: do you have any ideas how to over come the error: {standard input}:85: Error: unknown pseudo-op: `.value'
03:01  ddalton: ?
03:02  dvs: ddalton: wrong architecture?
03:02  dvs: I'm not sure
03:03  ddalton: dvs: no
03:03  ddalton: how could that be the case with using default setup?
03:03  ddalton: as I said the bug is rather specific 90% of functionality works, it was only until i used wpa2 enterprise i found problems.
03:08  ddalton: can anyone assit or am i just wasting my time?

03:59  Carneque: Hey all, I downloaded genesis-sync but am wondering how to install it since it doesn't have a config file
03:59  Carneque: I see a setup.py file
04:00  yagoo: Carneque, any decent online project must have a README file :p
04:00  Carneque: You'd think brother, but this one is really lacking crucial info
04:01  Carneque: https://launchpad.net/genesis-sync
04:04  ThePub: Carneque: is it a python project?  would seem to me if it has a setup.py then it uses the python build system.
04:05  afxx: python setup.py maybe :)
04:05  ThePub: have you tried something as simple as "python ./setup.py" from inside the source directory.
04:05  ThePub: Carneque: obviously it's not going to be using the debian package structure though, you've been warned.  ;)
04:06  Carneque: nm
04:07  yagoo: Carneque, it's a small app of 136 k.. the .deb marked as for ubuntu doesn't appear complex and should be able to work..
04:08  Carneque: yep, already did sudo python setup.py install
04:08  Carneque: To build genesis-sync you need python-distutils-extra
04:08  Carneque: which I already installed
04:09  Carneque: That's why I'm here
04:09  Carneque: I'll get it
04:10  ThePub: you've installed it then, no?  what's the problem?
04:10  Carneque: no problem I figured it out
04:11  ThePub: Ok, "I'll get it" indicated there were still issues.
04:11  Carneque: The python-distutils from the genesis-sync people are actually an enhancement to debian or ubuntu's python-distutils, so really they improperly are describing this dependency
04:12  Carneque: I think if I install this "enhancement" it will work
04:13  ThePub: I don't believe there is a "debian or ubuntu" python-distutils.. it's just python's distutil which is built into the version of python you're using.
04:13  Carneque: I mean debian or ubuntu (pick your flavor) and then there's this other enhancement hacky thing
04:15  ThePub: ah, distutils isn't a package manager.  don't get confused there :)
04:16  yagoo: Carneque, you're english is not very transparent. you may want to join a channel which you speak you're native language.
04:16 * yagoo has had too many thoughts on you're your :PP
04:17  Carneque: haha, you wouldn't want to call distutils a package then, so it's more of a ... ?

15:00  abrotman: okay .. and?

15:51  homie: so the group default to disk
15:51  homie: and not users
15:52  homie: so either one has to set the mode to someting like 0664 or change the udev rules so that it gets the default group root.users

15:55  homie: i think you use mkinitramfs manually for that
15:55  homie: not through update-initramfs
15:56  homie: or whatever your proggy for creating initrds initramfs defaults to
15:58  zxd_: homie: does mkinitramfs read /usr/share/initramfs-tools in addition to what I prove with -d argument?
15:58  zxd_: or instead ?

15:58  zxd_: provide
15:58  homie: zxd: i think so
15:59  homie: zxd: say you want a module to reside already in the initrd then you put it in /etc/initramfs-tool/modules then use mkinitramfs to build an initramfs wich already contains that module
16:00  homie: and is loaded when the initramfs gets loaded, not later

16:22  RenatoSilva: clemyeats: afaik the "-2" part is debian additions
16:22  llutz_: alex___: man chown/man chmod, adjust permissions since it is a unix-fs
16:22  iulhk: how can i verify the remonte machine i am using is dedicated server or a virtual machine ?
16:23  abrotman: RenatoSilva: there are git.debian.net, svn.debian.net .. etc
16:24  alex___: dutchfish: llutz_ I am trying to mount the disk at boot time, so I have the fstab which link I gave you, the permissions are OK
16:25  llutz_: alex___: read "man chown" / "man chmod" and adjust permissions since it is a unix-fs. you cannot use bootoptions for that
16:25  llutz_: alex___: "man mount" tells you, what "user , users" as option does. (not what you want/need)
16:25  RenatoSilva: abrotman: there are even more, so how to find the right place
16:25  alex___: llutz_: I know chmod and chown, if you could look one minute to my fstab you would see that I have xfs disk and only one of them is writable
16:26  alex___: llutz_: where do you want me to set the permission ?
16:26  SPF: I'm trying to install a raid card with rr26802.6.18-6-amd64x86_64.ko. But my kernel version is 2.6.26-2-amd64. When I try to load it, it returns Invalid module format
16:26  RenatoSilva: abrotman: git, svn, cvs, bzr, hg and maybe more
16:26  llutz_: alex___: on the filesystem you need writeaccess
16:27  alex___: llutz_: I understand what you telling me but I need to chmod at everyboot time ???
16:27  llutz_: alex___: no, set it once, ready

I run startx directly from the tty, I've checked my .xsession and .config/awesome/rc.lua (i run awesome wm) and none of them start devilspie. Yet the system is carrying out devilspie rules when windows show up, placing them on the correct desktop and stuff. also, "ps auxwww" shows no sign of devilspie. it is installed, though
16:53  bolt: what could possibly be starting it, and why isn't it showing up in my process list?
16:54  Bartzy: /usr/local/bin is a good place to put my iptables script ?

16:58  Bushmills: sbin probably better - but, why not /etc/network/if-up.d?
16:58  bolt: stwg_: depends entirely on what you want to run. you can surely start the kernel and a shell with that

18:11  dokma: I've checked Bacula but seems a bit bloated for this usage
18:11  dokma: what would you guyz use?
18:11  Vorbote: SPF, no chance in hell. You need to compile a version that matches your running kernel's version and ABI.
18:12  un214: rsync
18:12  un214: actually I've never used rsync myself
18:12  Vorbote: or unison.

18:12  un214: find -newer works wonders

18:13  un214: good luck, you're gonna need it
18:13  Vorbote: dokma, with MySQL (and any other database) you need to do either hotbackup or backup on static snapshots.
18:14  SPF: nsadmin: the source is available
18:14  dokma: I need hotbackup obviously
18:14  dokma: since it's a webserver machine
18:14  Vorbote: and as un214 said, that's full backup. no incremental copy there.
18:14  un214: for incremental, maybe mysql can do incremental
18:14  nsadmin: SPF, good... you will need source that's said to be compatible with 2.6.26
18:14  Vorbote: But you could set up a slave replicant for your database.
18:15  un214: Vorbote is correct

18:19  SPF: nsadmin: on the driver cd there's a .ko file for Debian 4.0 and a source package named rr26xx-linux-src-1.1-081014-1345.tar.gz
18:20  nsadmin: you could look at that tarball (hmm, interesting. so this cd came with the card?)
18:22  SPF: it contains some code and makefile, and generates rr26xx.ko. I wonder if I should replace the xx with my model number. In the source code they also work with xx
18:22  nsadmin: if the cd with these drivers came with the card, this shows the mfgr is very interested in supporting linux; if that's the case there may be updated source (and possibly bins) on their web site
18:23  nsadmin: no, it should be fine
18:23  nsadmin: the name with the xx should work
18:24  Moult: is there a list of all possible sources i can have in my sources file?
18:24  nsadmin: you mean you already tried compiling it and it's produced the .ko? if so... you're all set after you move it to the right dir and run depmod -a
18:25  nsadmin: Mould: there might be a list of -some- possible sources
18:25  SPF: it says it updated the initrd.img file
18:25  ma-ks: elo jest ktos z polski ?
18:25  Vorbote: the name rr26xx means that it is a driver for all RocketRaid cards of the 26xx model family. Don't change the name.

18:26  nsadmin: !pl

18:27  nsadmin: but if you want to write english, this would be the place
18:27  Vorbote: compile the module with the kernel-headers package that matches your running kernel and drop a copy in /lib/modules/<kernel version/updates, run depmod -a and your system should see the card after a reboot.
18:27  un214: nuclear missile ready
18:30  Vorbote: if to make card seen at early boot, add the name of the module to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and update the initrd.img file with "update-initramfs -k -u"

18:54  jhutchins_lt: iman: Perhaps you should contact oracle and find out why their software installs on RedHat products but not on Debian.

19:41  chovy: is there a decent interface for managing a server in debian repos?
19:41  chovy: ie: virtuamin or webmin?
19:41  anoob: which packages should i remove to deletye alsa completely?
19:41  chovy: neither seem to be included in the respo by default.
19:42  nsadmin: as a test to see if things work. I wouldn't actually run that kernel tho, things have changed that could make that kernel incompatible with the rest of your installation
19:42  nsadmin: webmin is not considered "decent" :)
19:44  FrEaKmAn_: how could I check the uptime of processes?
19:44  leafwiz_: HEy, I'm looking for a new web based torrent client to have on my server. TorrentFlux is out of steam.. :/
19:45  leafwiz_: Whats your recommendations ?
19:45  Vorbote: leafwiz_, either transmission or deluge would do nicely.
19:45  leafwiz_: Vorbote: allrihgt, thx. I'll try them out. :)
19:46  zykes-: wrong with flux ?
19:46  SPF: leafwiz_: you could also look into wtorrent
19:46  leafwiz_: SPF: Ohh.. looks nice as well
19:49  Vorbote: leafwiz_, do note that wtorrent doesn't do UPnP nor NAT-Traversal, the other two do.

20:11  BuggerMe: During a netinstall of lenny you can select your repository to download from. Is it possible to select any of the alternate volatile repositories during the install process?
20:17  Allanis: Buggerme: sure, but not recommended, you need think about dependancies too.
20:18  johntramp: hi.  i have a dual monitor setup which was working fine the other day, but after restarting X one of the monitors' colours are all washed out. have any of you any idea what would cause this or what i can do to fix it? cheers

20:22  Allanis: Did you not get the last line?
20:22  BuggerMe: Allanis: I only want to know as I am having issues connecting to volatile.debian.org on a consistent bases. I have been changing to a repository close to me (after install) that works well.

20:22  johntramp: the last line i got was xrandr --output LVDS1 --primary
20:22  Allanis: It should be fine BuggerMe.
20:23  BuggerMe: Allanis: So how is it done?

20:27  Allanis: Umm
20:27  Allanis: BuggerMe
20:27  Allanis: You can fiddle with /etc/sources.list file
20:28  Allanis: probably /target/etc/apt/sources.list during install
20:28  Allanis: If I remember it right, the installer won't immediately download stuff after selecting the volatile updates...
20:28  johntramp: i must take off. thanks for your time Allanis, ill keep working on it later

20:43  Allanis: Who is VLsoft?
20:43  vlsoft: Hi there, Allanis :P
20:43  BuggerMe: Allanis: Sorry for the delay, was working on the server in question. How can I select a different volatile repository during the install process of lenny?
20:44  vlsoft: Expert help is here :P
20:45  Allanis: sorry dury, what are you mounting again?
20:46  Allanis: hdb1 nvm
20:47  vlsoft: As "root", does this work?   mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
20:48  vlsoft: BuggerMe, I am usually fine with the default volatile server, but if you have problems, you have multiple options...
20:49  vlsoft: You can either edit your /etc/hosts file to have a line like this:  213.129.232.18 volatile.debian.org
20:49  Allanis: dury, place it into /etc/fstab
20:49  vlsoft: of course the IP has to be the IP of the server of choice
20:50  Allanis: /dev/sdb1       /drv/pendrive1  auto    rw,users,noauto,umask=002       0       0
20:50  Allanis: Replace the  noauto with auto. :)
20:51  lelu: is debian.org down?
20:51  vlsoft: Or, you can edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file and add the necessary lines (or modify them), if you manage to save it at the right stage, before the installer starts updating and downloading packages...
20:51  Allanis: no lelu
20:51  lelu: hmm well i cant get into http://packages.debian.org/
20:51  vlsoft: lelu, it's fine here too...
20:52  lelu: ahh must have been a blip, thanks for checking
20:52  Allanis: lelu:
20:52  Allanis: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
20:53  vlsoft: dury, if hdb1 has anything other than a vfat filesystem, leave out the umask=002 too :P
20:54  BuggerMe: vlsoft: I was ok with the default as well, but for some reason it fails 95% of the time so I am looking to be able to manually select the volatile repository I wont to use during the install process.
20:54  dury: right
20:55  lelu: is openssh-server the sshd client i need on my debian machine to ssh into it?
20:55  vlsoft: BuggerMe, start the installer in expert mode then, and use the second console to do your nasty editings (ALT-F2 ...)
20:55  lelu: *server
20:55  petemc: lelu: yes
20:55  BuggerMe: ty
20:55  vlsoft: lelu: while you're at it, just pull in the "ssh" package :)
20:56  stuckey: nvidia driver upgrades are automatic now?
20:56  lelu: vlsoft: do you mean via apt-get? because i dont have network access on the machine where I can access a monitor so i need to install via a deb file sshd so i can do the rest remote
20:57  vlsoft: BuggerMe, another thought: you might have to edit /target/etc/hosts, as /target is the mount point for your newly forming system...
20:57  vlsoft: lelu, I see...
20:57  vlsoft: then I'll check the packages for you.
20:57  vlsoft: pool/main/o/openssh/ssh_5.1p1-5_all.deb depends on openssh-client, openssh-server
20:58  vlsoft: openssh-client, well, that depends on a lot of other packages...
20:58  vlsoft: just like openssh-server
20:58  lelu: vlsoft: so a lot of deb's to download
20:58  vlsoft: of course dpkg will error out telling you the other .deb files it needs.

21:03  stuckey: vlsoft: thanks -- it didn't fail when I just ran it.
21:03  vlsoft: then you had it installed already :)
21:03  dury: is there a PySDM package for lenny
21:04  vlsoft: dury, my "apt-cache search pysdm" returned zero bytes...
21:04  seba_: hio
21:05  vlsoft: dury, but if there's an ubuntu package for it, you can easily hack it into your system too...
21:05  vlsoft: (well, not THAT easily if this is the first time you do such thing, but doable)
21:06  vlsoft: I would just grab the necessary .dsc .tar.gz and whatnot files based on the info found here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/pysdm    and would compile it with dpkg-buildpackage
21:07  vlsoft: you know, nowadays debian and ubuntu are quite compatible :)
21:08  seba_: the debian installer is not recognizing my harddrive (an ocz ssd).. what could possibly be the problem?
21:08  vlsoft: seba_, missing IDE or SATA module, so it can't even see your motherboard's controller...
21:08  vlsoft: you can try to load a few modules manually...
21:09  seba_: hmm which ones?
21:09  vlsoft: but to tell you anything that's more helpful than this, it would be good to know the type of the motherboad...
21:10  vlsoft: or if it's a laptop (yeah, it happens sometimes), then what model it is?

21:30  jhutchins_lt: Delaya: Deleting and re-creating then restoring is usually faster than "live" resizing.

21:31  jhutchins_lt: Delaya: gparted has the ability to resize theoretically without loosing the data, but I don't think fdisk does.

21:33  yagoo: skurt, yeah you can use LANG= in your bash login script.. or you can change it system-wide somewhere in /etc
21:33  jhutchins_lt: hXm: Looks like there are some good hits on google for "eyetv linux" but I don't knwo which would be relevant to you.
21:34  hXm: I also searched that query, but nothing good :/
21:34  skurt: I'd like to install japanese locale and I'm kind of afraid, I wouldn't be able to set i back in japanese
21:34  yagoo: skurt, if you have more than 1 locale i think the first locale is setup automatically.. if u need another i think the only way is to use LANG in a bash login script
21:34  teachme: l
21:35  jhutchins_lt: Delaya: No.
21:35  jhutchins_lt: However, the extended partition itself doesn't actually take any space.
21:35  jhutchins_lt: It doesn't have a size.
21:36  skurt: yagoo: well, I did this $ export LANG=ja_JP.utf8
21:36  skurt: but I'm still using english letters
21:36  jhutchins_lt: Delaya: I again recommend gparted.  You can get a bootable CD image and use that to resize the system.

22:07  anoob: hi, my sound has a annoying noise... my alsamixer jjust have pcm controls... any idea to solve that?
22:07  yagoo: anoob, is this a laptop?
22:08  abrotman: alsaconfig ?
22:08  abrotman: erm .. alsaconf
22:09  anoob: no... it's not a laptop yagoo... i've tried abrotman
22:09  abrotman: and it says ?
22:10  anoob: it was a successfull configuration

22:13  anoob: in alsaconf
22:14  anoob: update-modules: command not found
22:14  Deafgoose_: I have a cron that runs a php script located in var/www/domain-com/ however the file generated by the script (using php's fwrite() ) ends up in /root/ folder. in order for me to write the file to the the domain root I need to specify the path to fwrite, is there another way to do this? I have the same script on many domains and hand editing each would be a pain
22:14  abrotman: anoob: uname -r .. says what ?
22:15  anoob: abrotman: 2.6.32-5-486
22:15  abrotman: anoob: is it really a 486 ?
22:15  anoob: i guess... it's an amd duron 800mhz
22:16  abrotman: anoob: aptitude install linux-image-2.6-686 .. you don't want a -486 kernel
22:17  anoob: let me try
22:17  anoob: i do need to compile alsa again?
22:17  cahoot: again?
22:18  abrotman: compile?
22:18  lelu: apt-get install mc says the package cant be found :/
22:18  anoob: i've tried with alsa from repositories but it doesn't work at all... i've compiled and it's not working
22:18  abrotman: lelu: which version of Debian?
22:18  lelu: most recent
22:18  abrotman: anoob: that was silly
22:18  abrotman: lelu: that doesn't mean anything .. which version?
22:18  abrotman: !version
22:18  dpkg: Kernel: uname -r, or cat /proc/version.  Debian: cat /etc/debian_version (or lsb_release -sc) and: dpkg -l libc6 | tail -n 1.  Package: dpkg -l _pkgname_.  Miscellaneous: try --version on the command; check /etc/apt/sources.list; run apt-cache policy <packagename>.  Do cat /etc/{*version*,*release*,*issue*} which should grab almost all distributions.
22:18  anoob: actually my sound sometimes appears, sometimes not...
22:19  anoob: when it's working, it has noise
22:19  abrotman: lelu: put your /etc/apt/sources.list in a pastebin
22:20  anoob: i will try the 686 kernel and then i come back... abrotman

22:21  lelu: uk
22:22  lelu: it cant even find netselect
22:22  abrotman: lelu: add "deb http://mirrors.melbourne.co.uk/debian/ lenny main contrib non-free"  then `aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade && aptitude install mc`
22:25  lelu: thanks, looks like the previous mirror i was using was dead
22:27  abrotman: lelu: you didn't have any mirror at all in your sources
22:28  lelu: abrotman: well what i did have in there wouldn't load in the browser. in any case it works now and your help was much appreciated :)
22:28  lelu: this is why i stuck with debian, you guys are always helpful
22:29  newguy: i'm installing debian lenny via netinstall cd. i'm at the 'software selection' part. what exactly is the 'standard system'? and how will my system turn out if i don't choose it?
22:30  abrotman: newguy: you probably want it .. it's not a large set of packages, and they're generally useful
22:30  abrotman: it's stuff that will likely get installed later anyway
22:31  newguy: it won't install gnome, will it?
22:31  abrotman: no
22:31  newguy: ok. thanks
22:31  jhutchins_kc: newguy: desktop is the one that installs gnome.
22:31 --- jhutchins_kc is now known as jhutchins
22:32  abrotman: well, it won't always install gnome, depends on which CD you use
22:33  jhutchins: abrotman: netinst does gnome, right?
22:35  acemi_: jhutchins: you can choose the desktop env from the expert menu
22:35  jhutchins: Ah.
22:35  jhutchins: Thought I did expert, but...
22:36  acemi_: advaced options -> alternative desktop env

22:55  anoob: abrotman: uname -r: 2.6.32-5-686
22:56  zophy: anoob, do a lspci and an lsmod and see if you have a module loaded for your audio chip
22:57  anoob: yes, they are zophy
22:57  zophy: run alsamixer and trun on and turn up everything
22:57  anoob: do you wanna see the output zophy?
22:57  paxcoder: can someone tell me how to revert (gconf?) the no-icons gnome setup? i just added an app to the gnome panel, and right clicking shows no icons though they're useful to me.
22:58  anoob: zophy, lspci -v http://pastebin.com/HLXgqrBi
22:59  zophy: man..... i updated lenny and now X can't find the nvidia driver
22:59  f8l: zophy: I don't think ext3 has any kind of history, but I may be wrong.

22:59  f8l: zophy: If you want to recover data, I recommend testdisk.

23:03  nsadmin: SPF. good job... enjoy.
