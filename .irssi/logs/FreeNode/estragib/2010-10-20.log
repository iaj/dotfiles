14:31 estragib: now i am
14:34 iaj: you are using irssi vim as well correct :)?
14:34 estragib: absolutely :)
14:34 iaj: can you tell me what you use for escapig?
14:34 iaj: escaping*
14:34 iaj: evne
14:34 iaj: even :(
14:35 estragib: escaping as in ins -> cmd mode?
14:35 iaj: yeah.
14:35 estragib: escape :)
14:35 iaj: that got a delay right? :S
14:35 iaj: you remapped your escape key?
14:36 estragib: i don't have any delay and it's mapped to both esc and caps-lock here
14:36 estragib: caps lock <= best decision i ever made
14:36 iaj: really? no delay?
14:36 iaj: For me it takes few seconds
14:36 iaj: miliseonds
14:36 estragib: oh, that can't be right
14:36 iaj: miliseconds I mean :)
14:37 iaj: Its not the same as ctrl_C is
14:37 estragib: do you have another mapping that starts with esc/^[ maybe?
14:37 iaj: Hmm I don't think so... well.. how can I find out?
14:38 estragib: or wait, inside screen?
14:38 iaj: yeah inside screen!
14:38 iaj: :-S
14:38 iaj: is that the problem?
14:38 estragib: screen may be adding that timeout
14:38 estragib: one moment please
14:39 iaj: heh, thanks :)
14:39 iaj: yeah. maybe.
14:39 estragib: try your screen leader key, then :maptimeout 10
14:41 estragib: does that a) work at all, b) solve the problem?

14:46 iaj: where do I enter that :maptimeout 10?
14:47 estragib: first your normal screen command key, usually ^A, then :
14:48 estragib: the screen guys where heavily vi-influenced as well :)
14:48 estragib: ugh, *were
14:48 iaj: ifkalsjf lakjidflkja flkasjf laskjf lasfj  yeah
14:48 iaj: yeah
14:48 iaj: sorry
14:48 iaj: that solves the problem
14:49 estragib: excellent
14:49 estragib: put that into your screenrc, without the :
14:49 iaj: Im just still curious whether to use <ESC>, <CTRL-[>, <CTRL-C> or jj   to switch between modes.
14:50 iaj: but since I'm using netbeans now for programming jj is not an option
14:50 iaj: :d
14:51 estragib: i generally don't like the jj idea anyway, because of timeouts and working over slow connections or such. i used ctrl+[ until the caps lock xmodmapping
14:51 estragib: ctrl+c has slightly differint behavior under vim, so i stay away from that too
14:51 estragib: grr, different
14:52 iaj: hmmm, yeah the jj ain't as fast as just a basic mapping of capslock to escape was.
14:52 iaj: it has a different behaviour?
14:52 estragib: it's so incredibly handy in basically every other app that it isn't funny anymore
14:53 iaj: what do you mean? the escape mapping?
14:53 estragib: yes
14:53 iaj: you don't use screen I guess right?
14:54 estragib: i do
14:54 iaj: and you stick to CTRL-A ?
14:54 estragib: no, i use ^\
14:55 iaj: \ ? woah.. that's kinda off way isn't it?
14:55 estragib: right next to enter and nicely analoguous to the vim <Leader> key
14:55 estragib: ... was my thinking
14:56 estragib: i guess that doesn't work on every keyboard layout though :)
14:57 iaj: heh... yeah.. oh well I'm on MAC here.
14:57 estragib: as to ctrl-c, yes, *very* slightly different behavior. was enough for me.
14:58 estragib: see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/397229/reaching-up-to-hit-the-escape-key-sucks-especially-in-vim

15:05 iaj: ahh I see, alright damnit
15:05 iaj: !
15:06 estragib: :) concerning you question over in zsh, i tried remapping ^C to vi-cmd-mode, didn't work. you could probably cook something up with trapping SIGINT though. very much not recommended.
15:07 iaj: hm yeah - oh..well. im stuck now.. dunno what to do
15:07 estragib: ^[ not an option?
15:07 estragib: it's even in the vim help as a recommendation
15:08 iaj: it is.. but... i dunno if ill get so fast with it soon

15:08 iaj: oops
15:08 estragib: yeah, retraining is always a bitch
15:08 iaj: I just got into the jj flow
15:08 iaj: such a pity :(
15:08 estragib: post a bug report/wishlist item to netbeans? :)
15:10 estragib: probably not

15:12 iaj: Yeah i looked up in netbeans open discussion page, unfortuantely, theres no such thing in development
15:12 iaj: since 2 keys are too much to take
15:12 estragib: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2823324&group_id=3653&atid=353653
15:13 estragib: yeah, found that
15:13 estragib: you using the dev version of vim_mode? i'm not getting any kind of errors for quite some time now?
15:15 estragib: certainly a different version then mine. line 2192 is a commented out block in my vim_mode.pl :)
15:15 estragib: sigh, not my spelling day
15:16 iaj: hahaha... nah not dev..
15:16 iaj: w8 ill check
15:16 iaj: was using master
15:16 iaj: Oh btw is there a way to remove that timeout in zsh as well?
15:17 estragib: yup, KEYTIMEOUT=
15:18 estragib: careful, though. that will affect meta keys over slow connections
15:18 iaj: same problem :(
15:18 iaj: 15:18:15  Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /Users/iaj/.irssi/scripts/vim_mode.pl line 2213.
15:18 iaj: try hitting escape and I really fst
15:18 iaj: fast
15:19 estragib: hm. no problems here with that.
15:20 iaj: with ctrl-[ as well ?
15:20 iaj: I get that loads of times...
15:20 estragib: maybe ask on #irssi_vim
15:20 iaj: annoying!
15:20 estragib: i don't have any cmd_seq bound though. maybe it only does it if.
15:21 iaj: cmd_seq? Oh you mean the jj part
15:21 iaj: yea
15:21 iaj: that might be it
15:22 estragib: hm. not that either, at least not here. do ask the nice people over on irssi_vim :)
15:22 iaj: yeah that solved it
15:22 iaj: without the cmd_seq its working :)
15:22 estragib: oh.
15:22 iaj: now im forced not to use jj any more at least
15:23 iaj: I'm still scared to write jj haha
15:23 estragib: ha :)
15:23 iaj: woa, that may take another few weeks
15:23 iaj: really fuck that muscle memory haha
15:23 estragib: try dvorak while you're at it ;)
15:24 estragib: might as well, if you have to retrain anyway
15:24 iaj: hahah dvorak? I dunno
15:24 iaj: what's advantegeous about it?
15:25 estragib: me either. i did that over the last few months. i *am* faster than before, but i have no way to compare to what it'd be if had done qwerty training
15:25 estragib: it's mostly about less finger distance, it feels more comfortable. not sure at all if it's worth it though
15:26 estragib: for people going from hunt+peck => touch typing i'd say yes. otherwise, hell ne
15:26 estragib: *hell no
15:26 iaj: yeah... it was a pain in the ass to hunt-peck -> touchtype style a while back
15:27 iaj: im still hitting the c with my index finger sometimes
15:27 iaj: which frustrates me
15:27 iaj: I guess I need to write more textes... or something.
15:27 estragib: i have particular problems with f and x.
15:27 iaj: in dvorak?
15:27 iaj: I dunno where those are places :)
15:27 estragib: that would be z and b in qwerty
15:28 estragib: no, in qwerz. y and b in qwerty
15:29 estragib: will have to fire up klavaro again sometime soonish

15:37 iaj: klavaro?
15:37 iaj: wahts that?
15:37 iaj: yeah i hate b as well
15:37 iaj: y is ok now :D
15:38 estragib: touch typing tutor i used after i decided gtypist was too 1980 for me :)
15:38 estragib: there's probably better
15:43 iaj: ok adapted to KEYTIMEOUT=10
15:43 iaj: what a relief.
15:43 iaj: thanks mate :-)
15:44 iaj: btw do you have your dotfiles (zsh,vim) shared somewhere?
15:44 iaj: I love browsing those while at work ;-)
15:44 iaj: Where I am currently lolz
15:45 estragib: :) not yet, i do have them in git but not up anywhere. i'll ping you when.
15:45 estragib: if i remember, that is :p
15:46 estragib: and i agree, browsing others' dotfiles is great
15:46 estragib: especially instead of working
15:50 iaj: hahaha, yeah :-)
15:50 iaj: it really is :D

16:33 estragib: here
16:36 iaj: which plugins do you happen to use for vim?
16:38 estragib: probably the wrong person to ask. rather minimalist approach, wanted to get fluent with the basics first, didn't find i need much. i have surround.vim.
