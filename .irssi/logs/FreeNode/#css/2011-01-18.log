00:01  sorwork_: oksushi: yea, well, if the mozilla developer page had all the specific extensions that had css applied to them that might be easier.

00:02  sorwork_: sorry, button (as in the tag, not plural)

00:36  Shay128: Hi , anyone here from the USA ?

00:41  MauriceJ: ]vertical align @ Variability
00:41  MauriceJ: er
00:41  Variability: vertical-align:bottom; does not seem to work
00:41  Variability: 01:33 <Variability> how*
00:42  Shay128: lucasw: the problem the font size changing from browser to browser
00:42  Shay128: I cant understand why this happening
00:43  Shay128: any idea?
00:44  MauriceJ: ]vertical-align
00:44  MauriceJ: moo bot

00:44  MauriceJ: I give up :D
00:45  MauriceJ: Forgot the command for that
00:45  KenBW2: anyone else find forms a huge pain in the rear with CSS?
00:45  MauriceJ: KenBW2: I haven't yet.
00:45  KenBW2: uncontrollable paddings, widths; browser differences
00:45  MauriceJ: It's magic and voodoo.
00:46  KenBW2: eg why does a <select> end up with a different width than an <input type="text" /> than a button
00:46  KenBW2: and then theyll be different on a different OS
00:46  KenBW2: argh
00:46  MauriceJ: KenBW2:  And then there's also the user's choice of font and size for their browser.
00:47  Variability: !vertical
00:47  KenBW2: at least font sizes are consistent
00:47  KenBW2: i have no idea how wide a form element will be, regardless of the fact that ive specified a width
00:48  MauriceJ: Indeed, it's quite a tricky dicky.
00:49  schwarzes: i have put #search ( border: 5px solid #B00259; padding: 10px; ) in the layout.css file, but there is no border around the search section on the right here http://www.therapybusinessblog.com/ can aanyone tell me why
00:50  KenBW2: is that really a li ?

00:55  schwarzes: you can see the newsletter there
00:56  KenBW2: schwarzes: i see the #newsletter, but not #search
00:56  schwarzes: yes strange

01:16  KenBW2: yea
01:17  KenBW2: that site is crippling my computer btw - dunno what youre using
01:18  MauriceJ: ogp: What are you using to debug on your browser?
01:19  KenBW2: line 68 of style.css, the #content selector
01:20  KenBW2: those slideshows are killing my PC, you might want to reassess them
01:20  ogp: if i change it there, it will affect my homepage layout as well. both are different phps.
01:20  ogp: the page i sent is the category page.
01:21  KenBW2: ogp: the problem is that the margin-right on #content is less than the width of the right sidebar, so theyre crashing into each other
01:21  KenBW2: a quick firebug should show you whats happening
01:21  MauriceJ: ogp: What are you using to debug on your browser?
01:22  ogp: nothing really.
01:22  ogp: im not a html or css expert. trying to learn.
01:23  KenBW2: ogp: first thing is to install Firebug in Firefox
01:23  MauriceJ: ogp: I told you some days ago to install Firebug.
01:23  ogp: i have it.
01:23  KenBW2: makes debugging much easier
01:23  ogp: i have it maurice and i use it all the time :)
01:23  ogp: but this issue is a bit complicated..
01:23  KenBW2: not really
01:23  MauriceJ: ogp: Time for you to learn how to use it and stop claiming to know nothing.  You've been in here for days asking people to fix things for you rather than learning how to fix CSS yourself.
01:23  ogp: everytime i chanage the parameters on one file, its changes the other.
01:23  KenBW2: open up firebug and hover over #content
01:27  ogp: maurice, u are absolutely wrong.
01:28  ogp: i am learning and im only here when i am stuck.
01:28  ogp: please stop making judgements.
01:28  MauriceJ: ogp: I disagree as I've been watching you in here but fine, think what you want.
01:28  ogp: the issue i have right now is not just change the parameter
01:28  ogp: as soon as i change the margin, the homepage gets messed up.
01:29  ogp: im upset that u have a problem with someone trying to learn.
01:29  MauriceJ: ogp: I don't see you learniong.

01:57  yoyo925: no one knows?
01:59  MauriceJ: yoyo925: You don't know.  You're also coming into a VOLUNTEER channel.  Ask and be patient, demanding will be seen as rude and turn people away.

02:36  snufft: i'm having a 100% height problem. i have a repeating background on my site container, but the content within it is longer than the screen width. because the site container is set to 100%, it only backgroun-tiles the screen size, it doesn't continue on for the overflowing text. considering i have some pages where the content is longer than the screen is high, and some pages where this is not the case, how can i make a situation that works in b
02:38  primepie: is there an easy way to center a div in absolute center of the page regardless of the content inside?
02:44  snufft: primepie: not without a width of the div

03:04  lucasw: yoyo925 that site have two different bgs a white one and a blueish one?
03:05  yoyo925: ya
03:05  yoyo925: well
03:05  yoyo925: its one bg
03:05  yoyo925: its one image file

03:08  yoyo925: ya
03:08  yoyo925: cuz i gave it a height
03:08  yoyo925: of 600 or something
03:08  yoyo925: but if i dont put a height there...it doesnt show up at all
03:09  lucasw: what if u put min-height: 2px; then?
03:09  yoyo925: ok i just did
03:09  yoyo925: now look at it
03:09  yoyo925: see how it just doesnt even show it?
03:10  yoyo925: actually it does show it...but just 2 px worth
03:10  yoyo925: its annoying
03:12  lucasw: what does that 'transparent' thing in your background {} do?
03:12  yoyo925: not sure...where r u seeing it?

03:14  yoyo925: i dont see it on my style.css over here
03:15  yoyo925: ?
03:15  lucasw: wtf it must be my firebug tahts bugged
03:16  lucasw: when i looked into the source and manually looked it up it wasnt there :P
03:17  yoyo925: lol
03:17  yoyo925: dam i cant believe its this hard to make a bg continue its height
03:18  lucasw: btw why dont you wanna use height if it works? :P
03:18  lucasw: u want it to be expandable?
03:19  lucasw: if so try using like min-height: 600px and it will grow simultaneously when ur site grows
03:20  yoyo925: ya i want it to expand cuz the main page will have different sized blog posts
03:20  yoyo925: i tried min height 300px to test that...but anything beyond 300 px didnt show the bg
03:21  yoyo925: like rite now i made the min height 100px
03:21  yoyo925: but instead it just shows it as 100px tall
03:22  digitalfiz: yoyo925, put a div at the bottom with <div style="clear: both"></div>
03:22  jedimind: no, dont
03:22  lucasw: try min-height: 100%; ?
03:22  digitalfiz: inside the div with the background but under the content
03:22  jedimind: i swear to god if one more person suggests a clearing div, im gonna have to choke a bitch
03:22  jedimind: yoyo925, http://www.ejeliot.com/blog/59
03:23  digitalfiz: jedimind, whats wrong with them? it works fine and does what its supposed to
03:23  yoyo925: jedimind: the #footer div has clear:both in it
03:23  lucasw: jedimind is #sidebar:after {clear: both;} acceptable?
03:23  yoyo925: and thats at the bottom
03:23  yoyo925: or should i put another?
03:23  jedimind: you're adding an element to the markup that serves absolutely no purpose
03:24  jedimind: you markup should be used to display content
03:24  jedimind: yoyo925, read that url, do yourself a favour
03:24  yoyo925: i think it worked
03:24  yoyo925: i read the blog u sent
03:25  yoyo925: and i did overflow:auto
03:25  yoyo925: but it says for ie 6 and below u have to set a height or something
03:25  jedimind: see, and you didnt even have to add a div
03:25  jedimind: imagine that
03:25  yoyo925: which i wud think defeats the perpose
03:25  jedimind: for ie6 and below all you have to do is trigger hasLayout
03:25  jedimind: which you can do with zoom: 1 for example
03:25  jedimind: but i wouldnt bother with IE6 if i were you
03:25  yoyo925: ok so how do i do that
03:26  yoyo925: do i just add zoom: 1 somewhere?
03:26  jedimind: yeah, ideally in a css file specific to IE6
03:26  jedimind: ]condcom
03:26  _ZofBot4: IE Conditional Comments: http://haslayout.net/condcom
03:26  jedimind: using a conditional comment ^
03:26  jedimind: otherwise, if you dont care about validating your css; you can simply do overflow: auto; zoom: 1;
03:26  jedimind: and call it a day
03:26  yoyo925: jedi im doing that
03:27  yoyo925: i dont even know wut zoom does
03:27  yoyo925: but its goin in there
03:27  jedimind: in this case you're uzing zoom to do trigger something called hasLayout in IE6 and turn it on
03:27  jedimind: which forces IE to re-evaluate that container after the floated elements get rendered
03:27  jedimind: and therefore stretches down below them
03:27  yoyo925: If you're not concerned about supporting IE 5.0 or Mac IE then the proprietary zoom property (zoom:1) might be a better bet than width:100% although it does mean your CSS won't validate.
03:27  jedimind: in theory it's the same thing that overflow does in this case
03:28  jedimind: for other browsers
03:28  yoyo925: so does that mean that zoom:1 doesnt work for mac ie and ie 5?
03:28  jedimind: there's absolutely no reason why you should be coding anything for mac IE
03:29  yoyo925: i wanna also add "clear:both" to make it extra safe...just not sure where to add it...after the container div?
03:29  jedimind: i dont think it exists in zimbabwe even any more
03:29  jedimind: you dont need to add clear: anything
03:29  yoyo925: k
03:29  yoyo925: thnx
03:29  jedimind: with overflow and zoom, you're covered in every browser that counts plus IE6
03:29  yoyo925: except for some reason theres a gap before the bg...its like an 8 pixel gap
03:30  yoyo925: http://brightnfit.com/wp/
03:30  jedimind: do you have a margin-top of 8px
03:30  jedimind: on the inside elements ?
03:30  yoyo925: lemme check
03:30  yoyo925: jedimind:  no margins on the inside elements
03:30  jedimind: hrm
03:31  yoyo925: maybe i can just start the container higher up
03:31  yoyo925: cuz itll get covered anyways
03:31  digitalfiz: jedimind, i get it i just didnt know there was a easier solution then the clear divs :) thanks for the link
03:31  jedimind: just fyi; * { padding: 0px; margin: 0px; } you can just do padding: 0; margin: 0;
03:31  yoyo925: k
03:31  jedimind: because zero is zero, regardless of it's pixels or ... elephants
03:31  yoyo925: im gonna try putting the container div higher to start
03:32  jedimind: brb
03:32  yoyo925: nvm that messed it up
03:34 --- Curt` is now known as curt`off
03:34  jedimind: yoyo925, i found the problem
03:34  yoyo925: is it hard to fix
03:34  jedimind: your #search-section is taller than it should be for some reason
03:34  jedimind: so it's pushing everything below it down
03:35  yoyo925: o
03:35  jedimind: because you have height: 36px + padding-top: 6px;
03:35  yoyo925: cuz of the padding top 6 px
03:35  jedimind: which is 42px total instead of 36
03:35  yoyo925: ok but the reason for that padding wuz to push the search box down
03:35  yoyo925: i didnt know how else 2 do that
03:35  jedimind: it's cool just adjust your height then
03:35  digitalfiz: line-height right?
03:35  jedimind: height: 30px; padding-top: 6px;
03:36  jedimind: so it's a total of 36
03:36  jedimind: instead of 42
03:36  yoyo925: that wont mess it up?
03:36  jedimind: nope

03:36  jedimind: im only doing this beacuse im expecting you to read all these links im sending your way
03:36  jedimind: so you better study, there's a test tomorrow
03:37  yoyo925: is digitalfiz right tho?....cuz he said padding cud render different...at this point i shud just leave it
03:37  yoyo925: cuz its reading fine rite now
03:37  jedimind: you have a proper doctype, all (mostly all) dimensions you set in respect to height/width/padding/margins will be 100% accurate in all browsers
03:38  jedimind: with a few exceptions like same-sided margins when you float in ie6
03:38  jedimind: but by and large, all paddings/margins/etc will be identical throughout
03:38  digitalfiz: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/internet_explorer_and_the_css_box_model/
03:38  jedimind: so nothing is in quirks mode, which is the only time the box model seriously gets fucked up
03:38  jedimind: digitalfiz, read closer :) it's only when it's in quirks mode / non standards mode

03:39  jedimind: there are minor discrepencies even in standards mode, but you wont notice them unless you're doing something really tricky
03:39  digitalfiz: i always have problems with it lol i guess my stuff is always in quirks mode
03:39  jedimind: which he isnt
03:39  jedimind: digitalfiz, more often than not, those kinds of things are as a result of overcomplicating things
03:40  digitalfiz: i tend to do that a lot ive been working on simplifying the things i do
03:41  digitalfiz: kind of why ive idling in here now :P

04:39  AMcBain: mikeric, uh ...
04:39  AMcBain: what?
04:39 --- Channel #css was synced in 108 seconds
04:39  AMcBain: Why would you not consider images a valid part of any UI?
04:41  mikeric: AMcBain: unless it's actually an image/photo, it's just another request to a separate file.. it's not scalable either..
04:42  AMcBain: ...
04:42  mikeric: wow
04:42  mikeric: really? you disagree?
04:42  AMcBain: usually photos are kilobites in size, and if you're really worried you can make a sprite to download chunks that relate all at once reducing requests.
04:42  mikeric: yes, i understand how it's been done for a while..
04:43  AMcBain: I don't see how images in the UI aren't scalable, unless you have a habit of making extreme use of zillions of images and many large ones.
04:43  mikeric: i'm just curious is people are using canvas for these things yet. it seems like a way better option.
04:44  mikeric: i mean for different resolutions and when they zoom.
04:44  mikeric: the text and css elements scale fine
04:44  AMcBain: Not really imo. Sure you can do a lot more, but I don't think it's worth it to replace UI items.
04:45  AMcBain: Canvas wouldn't be able to tell when you zoom either.
04:45  mikeric: but once you have rasterized images as part of the ui, you notice the pixelation.
04:45  AMcBain: You know Canvas is technically backed by a raster image, right?
04:45  mikeric: oh, right. isn't canvas essentially rendering jpeg?
04:45  mikeric: yea, nevermind then.
04:46  mikeric: and svg is dog slow..
04:47  AMcBain: um, at this point I think you're just spouting things out to try and start pointless conversations ...
04:48  mikeric: yea, probably. i've just seen hacks like using special characters and rotating them in order to get a scalable arrow.. heh..
04:49  AMcBain: CSS lets you do triangles.
04:49  mikeric: canvas seemed better, but i forgot it's not actually scallable geometry.
04:49  AMcBain: If you don't mind using an empty tag and playing with the border sizes.
04:49  mikeric: oh yea?
04:49  mikeric: oh, right
04:50  AMcBain: Though knowledge of that presents a interesting problem.
04:51  AMcBain: If all browsers join at the diagonal at the corners, thus allowing you to make triangles, when you create a normal border (square, whatnot) with translucent colors and look at it in Safari (WebKit) why do the corners appear darker than the rest (because of overlaps)?
04:52  Variability: yeeeaah
04:52  Variability: AMcBain yeaaah man!
04:53  AMcBain: Dunno what you've had, but you've had a bit much I think.
04:55  mikeric: AMcBain: actually, a perfect example is Vimeo's HTML 5 player. all the ui elements are canvas geometry.
04:55  mikeric: the clock, the heart, etc..
04:55  mikeric: that seems way better than png+alpha sprites.
04:56  mikeric: for reasons i don't know anymore..

05:36 --- Channel #css was synced in 108 seconds
05:39  Lazylegs: rainmanjam, some spacing vertical spacing between the entry title, date and body text would make it bit more readable (just my opinion)
05:39  rainmanjam: gotcha
05:40  Lazylegs: rainmanjam, you have webkit browser (chrome or safari), I might do the exlusive like this: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02m&raw
05:40  Lazylegs: Sorry for bad design.. on laptop and lot easier to code it than draw it X)
05:40  Lazylegs: but you get my point, really really a mockup
05:42  tieTYT: hello, I have seen a trick where you load a really large image as a sprite, and just use "frames" of it as a background-image to certain tags.  Is this still recommended to speed up loading, and, what is it called so I can google it?
05:43  AMcBain: I don't think anyone has rebranded it, it's still called a sprite, or possibly spriting.
05:44  Lazylegs: tieTYT, and to continue AMcBain.. background-position: is used to control sprite location in the element
05:44  AMcBain: and as for recommendations or not, all it really does is reduce the number of times someone must hit the server to get images, and if your images are small enough it may not matter.
05:44  Lazylegs: Excellent if lots of :hover effects, no extra download required
05:44  AMcBain: The only place I've seen it immediately useful is for hover images. If you put the regular state and the hover in the same image (sprite) there's no flicker when it tries to download the hover for the first time.
05:45  AMcBain: bah, you beat me to it! :P
05:45  Lazylegs: :P
05:45  Lazylegs: I just continued from where you left
05:45  tieTYT: ok cool
05:45  tieTYT: well then, I figure that breaking it up would be easier to deal with then
05:46  AMcBain: easiest to not sprite them, yeah. though the hover thing is nice. so you could just make that the only set you combine.

06:46  jeff2: hmw: yeah it does
06:46  mikeric: or does this mean using a wrapping element with the gradient..
06:46  hmw: jeff2: in CSS you can't assign width to inline elements. I guess, that is the reason.
06:47  hmw: mikeric: not with CSS2
06:47  hmw: mikeric: but you can try something like <div><h1>...</h1></div> and assigning one image to the div and the other to the h1
06:48  mikeric: yea

10:47  iaj: MauriceJ: just have an background on the input field?
10:48  xotix: i have a div with a few <p>'s and i want to add the first on a clear:both. the div has a class so i made .dibclass p:first {clear: both} why does that not work?
10:48  MauriceJ: iaj do you know how to do background images on elements?
10:49  MauriceJ: xotix: What you're doing sounds well intentioned but entirely wrong, please give a test case using the URL in the topic.
10:50  xotix: uh its fro ma big project. i can rebuild the structure. wait
10:50  iaj: MauriceJ: i tried input[type="text"]{ background: url(/path/to/image.jpg); }  that wrong?
10:51  iaj: because it doesn't get accepted?
10:51  MauriceJ: iaj: That is correct and you can also set an ID on the specific input if there are several inputs and images to apply.
10:52  MauriceJ: iaj: Try putting url(./path/to/image.jpg) and make sure the CSS sheet is relative to the image exactly as in the path.
10:54  xotix: mauriceJ, i cant give you a test case. the header and all the stuff gets generated. i just have a div and want to add some style on its first paragraph. :) just a es or no, is that possible? and if yes, im on the rigth way with first-child?
10:54  MauriceJ: xotix: What is the clear:both; supposed to do in this case?
10:54  MauriceJ: xotix: How about a URL to the page then?
10:55  MauriceJ: xotix: I can't see what you're doing so I can't answer 'just a yes or no' as that would require me being psychic.
10:55  xotix: localy installed. because some floating. yeah wait u'll get a link

10:59  MauriceJ: iaj: background:url(images/gradientyellow.png)  You have the path there but it's not done correctly, the little example I gave you up there will be helpful.
11:00  xotix: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02n so i want to apply clear:oth to the p which got it atm but i dont want to give it a class or soemthing.
11:01  speak: MauriceJ relative paths can be done like that, as well
11:01  iaj: you mean I should stick to ./ ?
11:01  Lazylegs: xotix, first-child or would use p:first-of-type
11:01  MauriceJ: xotix: Regarding first-child this is what it says on quirksmode.org
11:01  MauriceJ: Browser doesn’t update the styles when elements are added dynamically.
11:02  MauriceJ: speak: Right.
11:02  MauriceJ: iaj: That is my suggestion, yes.
11:02  iaj: another thing can I replace select boxes (with the arrow inlcuded) with a image?
11:03  xotix: MauriceJ i know. i just want to hide unhide them when clicking on de en. ^^ i've tried it with first-child. liek you see in the css.
11:03  MauriceJ: iaj: All I can tell you about that is that select boxes are supremely difficult to style.  I am lacking more information on that but that is a painful truth that many have discovered.
11:03  MauriceJ: xotix: Hold on let me check.
11:03  xotix: actually, i dont rly need to float the h1 and so i dont rly need to clear the p. hmm dont knwo why i did that but doesnt matter, i want to knwo how it would work, im doing that for learning.
11:04  xotix: mauriceJ in the css it should be .languageDivs p:first-child, but that doesnt work either.
11:05  MauriceJ: xotix: Yes, as I said earlier it sounded like you were donig something entirely wrong because applying clear:both; out of the blue makes no sense.
11:05  iaj: MauriceJ: thanks for the information :)
11:06  MauriceJ: iaj: Good luck!  If you have further issues with b/g images on input let me know and we'll troubleshoot.
11:06  xotix: hmm, yeah so i leavt it. thanks
11:11  iaj: MauriceJ: yay.. thanks.. well I set a fixed height on a select box. adjusted a background image and just padded the normal select style out of it.. but I doubt that's the best solution ;) but its working... (on FF at least)

13:00  dumont: and declaring font: 8pt verdana; font:20pt ABCD; doesn't work when ABCD font isn't loaded
13:01  dumont: cuz it overwrites it completely
13:01  lucasw: dumont declare a backwards compatible font to use with older browsers tbh
13:01  dumont: and just uses browser default
13:01  dumont: lucasw its a pixel perfect layout, and the compatible fonts are about 2 times bigger using the same point based size
13:02  dumont: no i will not change pixel perfect, no i can't use a diff font
13:02  okaycool: I can create a triangle/arrow with CSS borders, but is this kind of arrow possible http://d.pr/Ldhv with the middle portion remaining transparent?
13:02  dumont: unless you know of a way to change the font size for fallback fonts while not chaning the size for main font, all has been tried and failed
13:04  lucasw: http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=890529 dumont havent tried that, but maybe it will work? i dunno :P
13:06  lucasw: or something like http://www.webdevout.net/test?0a
13:06  lucasw: but then it becomes javascript
13:07  Lazylegs: dumont>
13:07  okaycool: okay that DigitalPoint page just confused my spelling for Mozilla
13:07  Lazylegs: dumont, you can use javascript to check browser.. go to ##javascript for more
13:07  Lazylegs: conditional comments work only for Internet explorers
13:08  okaycool: anyone know how to do this triangle in CSS http://d.pr/Ldhv
13:08  okaycool: with the middle portion remaining transparent
13:09  speak: probably not worth it try to construct it in css
13:09  Lazylegs: no it is not
13:10  okaycool: hmmmm
13:10  okaycool: true
13:10  iaj: hmmm i got a problem, can someone tell me what attribute is missing to have my iframe on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=26 take its full height on thsi page?
13:12  Lazylegs: iaj, height: 100% from iframe?
13:13  iaj: Lazylegs: tried that.. look for yourself - nothing changes
13:13  Lazylegs: iframe is lot taller for sure
13:13  Lazylegs: approx 1000px atleast
13:14  iaj: its 1300px.. yeh.
13:14  iaj: but how can I have it fully displayed.. without giving fix height to it?
13:15  MauriceJ: ]iframe
13:15  Lazylegs: iaj, why you even use iframe?
13:15  MauriceJ: iaj: iframes are bad for your mental health. :)
13:17  MauriceJ: A lot of code from JS can't get executed in them and they cause other issues.  There are good articles about not using them on the net and valid reasons given.  You might want to check them out before you continue.
13:20  iaj: Hmmm, yeah. well its just 'my order', told them so..  So I guess its their problem then ;)
13:21  MauriceJ: iaj:  Haha okay.
13:21  Lazylegs: iaj, load the stuff with XHR
13:28  marik: hi, is possible to make input width up to image without setting exact size? http://www.webdevout.net/test?0b
13:29  Dartfall: marik, typo at "stlye="float:left;""
13:34  marik: Dartfall, where?
13:34  marik: didn't find it
13:36  speak: do you know how to use the browser find function?
13:42  timing: is it possible to have a background image a certain amount of pixels from the bottom?
13:42  timing: I tried -160px left
13:42  timing: but that doesn't seem to work
13:42  timing: I have this: 	background: url(/wp-content/themes/distimo/bob/bottom.png) bottom left repeat-x;
13:43  blackice2999: timing: use a padding in div
13:43  timing: hmm ok elt me see
13:43  lhunath: get the order right.
13:43  timing: the lhunath what do you mean?
13:44  timing: blackice2999: padding gives the div a bigger height, but the bg is still at the bottom
13:45  lhunath: timing: the X coordinate comes BEFORE the Y coordinate.  left bottom.
13:45  timing: hmm ok
13:45  timing: but why does it work then
13:45  timing: ?
13:46  lhunath: you've never noticed broken html "working" before?
13:46  timing: pretty evil if it's not that strict
13:46  timing: haha yeah I've seen that :-)
13:46  lhunath: html and css have never been strict.  the result is a hideously coded web.
13:46  timing: true :-)
13:46  lhunath: yours actually fails in certain browsers.
13:47  marik: speak, this is the page there is no ""
13:48  timing: lhunath: hmm really? didn't know that. I always mix them up. Thanks
13:49  speak: the typo is stlye
13:49  lhunath: just think, "x y"
13:49  marik: oh
13:49  marik: :)
13:51  marik: anyway it doesn't solve the problem, i want textbox and image to occupy the cell
13:54  marik: Do i have to specify exact size to textbox?
13:55  dumont: what's the best way to mark up a tag to identify that for example it is important for search engines, like marking up a title of the page? the tag is a <p> tag
13:56  lhunath: marik: inherit the cell's width and height?
13:56  ZombieLoffe: dumont: uhh, you use appropriate elements. If you have a heading, use <h*> element, and a SE will realize it's important (being a header)
13:56  dumont: ughhh
13:57  dumont: how do I remove all the special stuff a header brings with it?
13:57  ZombieLoffe: What special stuff?
13:57  marik: lhunath, i want the txtbox + image to take 100% of the cell
13:57  dumont: header isn't bold?
13:57  ZombieLoffe: dumont, you use CSS to style it any way you want
13:57  dumont: any other styles it has attached to it?
13:57  lhunath: dumont: don't use a header if your content isn't syntacically header content.
13:57  ZombieLoffe: increased font-size and top/bottom margins
13:58  dumont: so to make <h*> tag plain text i need to set font size, and set margin:0; ? what about padding?
13:59  temhawk: dumont: google css reset
13:59  ZombieLoffe: Nope. And in the future, try it and see instead of asking >_>
13:59  ZombieLoffe: And yeah, a CSS reset is probably a good idea.
14:02  marik: so how can i do that?
14:03  MauriceJ: marik: How would you try to work something like that out?
14:03  temhawk: marik: width: inherit; height: inherit;
14:05  marik: MauriceJ, i tired to set width of textbox like: width:95%
14:05  marik: temhawk, didn't help
14:06  temhawk: marik: make a test case and show meh
14:06  temhawk: http://webdevout.com/
14:08  MauriceJ: marik: You have a lot of very bad errors in your inline CSS.  You may want to work on that as that could very well be causing 50% of the problems you encounter.
14:08  marik: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01M
14:09  marik: what errors?
14:09  MauriceJ: marik: My bad I was looking at somebody else's URL.  Sorry about that.
14:10  temhawk: marik: hmmm... validator says "there is no attribute style"
14:11  ndss56: Marik: Have you tried google because thats your friend - quote MauriceJ.
14:11  marik: yes i did
14:11  MauriceJ: ndss56: Hey, welcome back helpchannel vampire.
14:12  dumont: is there an easy way of listing all the h1 h2 h3 ... all together?
14:12 * ndss56 lets make a #css welcome message such as "Hi, Welcome to #CSS, now goto Google because thats your friend, Bye Bye Now".
14:13  temhawk: dumont: h1, h2, h3, etc { }
14:13  MauriceJ: ndss56: Only channel vampires resent not being spoonfed.
14:13  MauriceJ: Couldn't even google to check about checkboxes, pretty lame.
14:13  dumont: temhawk smartass
14:14  temhawk: dumont wtf?
14:14  dumont: are you going to tell me that you response was valid?
14:14  dumont: and that etc is a proper way of listing h4 h5?
14:14 * MauriceJ watches further alienation in progress.
14:15  temhawk: dumont: don't act dumb now, i don't feel like wasting my time, ok? thanks
14:15  dumont: sorry, but I was reading tha literraly...
14:15  dumont: not metaphorically
14:15  temhawk: dumont: use some brain
14:15 * ndss56 BTW if you ask for help in #CSS you might be called a horrible name like "help vampire". Please enjoy your stay at #CSS. We do hope you visit us again.
14:16  dumont: usually I get stuff like that... this time I guess I was dead on reading it literally
14:16  temhawk: :)
14:16  dumont: ohh I know why
14:17  dumont: because ndss56 and MauriceJ are talking shit about being spoonfed :) and I guess I took that more personally isnce I didn't know who it was refering to
14:18  MauriceJ: dumont: You could use a little more self-motivation in learning yourself.
14:18  dumont: MauriceJ it comes and goes, sometimes I'm more self motivated and don't even need css channel, other times you see me here :P pulling your tongue ;)
14:22  ndss56: dumont: its perfectly fine to ask for help, and people who don't want to help should just be quiet. name calling like "help vampire" is childish behaviour :)
14:25  skrypets: i have an IE 7 issue , tooltip hiding under next input field ,some suggestions ? http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/4751/ie7overlapissue.jpg
14:26  Lazylegs: skrypets, URL?
14:26  skrypets: i cant provide the site
14:26  Lazylegs: from image impossible to tell
14:26  skrypets: z-index is ok
14:26  dumont: maybe ie7 bug?
14:27  ndss56: skrypets: have you tried google by any chance?
14:27  skrypets: ok i'll try to show chunk of code
14:27  Lazylegs: skrypets, do a testcase to webdevout.net/test
14:28  Jackass4D: stop fundling with IE! go on with your life!!
14:28  skrypets: thats project requirement ))
14:28  skrypets: and that fkinf ticket hanging on me
14:28  skrypets: so i need to resolve it
14:29  ndss56: IE 8 is awesome
14:29  ndss56: I highly recommend it.
14:29  sriley: skrypets: ie gives any element that has position an new z-index stack, so zindexs are relative to parent positioned element in ie, not parent zindexed element as in other browsers. cant remember if ie8 fixed that
14:30  skrypets: ie8 works fine for that issue
14:30  sriley: i assume maybe your inputs are positioned?
14:37  skrypets: thats the issue http://jsfiddle.net/skrypets/qA2xw/
14:37  skrypets: http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/4751/ie7overlapissue.jpg
14:38  skrypets: maybe something wrong in css ? only in ie7 hiding behind input
14:39  nkuttler: skrypets: well. the older IEs sometimes care more about element order in the markup than z-index and such
14:39  nkuttler: can't remember if that was the case in 7 though
14:44  Shay128: Someone here ? :)

15:05 --- Sean is now known as Guest6836
15:06 * foo smacks iaj_ 
15:06  foo: I'll show you how!
15:09  dumont: small hiduki... I place a floating left image on the page and a h1 within the same vartical space, problem is, the text doesn't align by the box's margins, the alignment width has been subtracted with the width of the interfeering image, so if the image is really wide on a large page, the text in h1 is centered between the edge of the image and the side of the page
15:09  dumont: i want it to center without accounting for the image
15:10  aurilliance: Does the font property need to have a font-family supplied in order to work?
15:10  dumont: aurilliance not really
15:10  dumont: just name the font
15:10  dumont: font: 20pt Verdana;
15:10  aurilliance: dumont, what if I just want it to inherit from the body tag?
15:11  dumont: inherit what?
15:11  aurilliance: the font-family
15:11  aurilliance: netsplit
15:11  dumont: then try font-family: inherit;
15:12  dumont: Note: No versions of Internet Explorer (including IE8) support the property value "inherit".
15:12 --- Godslastering is now known as Guest48246
15:15  iaj_: foo, haha :D
15:15  iaj_: sorry about that
15:15  foo: iaj_: haha, juts kidding :)
15:15  ZombieLoffe: aurilliance: iirc the ´font´ shorthand requires, at the minimum, font-size and font-family values to work
15:16 --- MauriceJ is now known as DrunkenMonkeySty
15:17 --- DrunkenMonkeySty is now known as DrunkMonkeyStyle
15:18  ZombieLoffe: dumont: IE8 supports it.
15:18  dumont: blame http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_font_font-family.asp
15:19  ZombieLoffe: dumont: have I not told you w3schools is crap yet?
15:20  ZombieLoffe: but it's actually right there, font-family: inherit; is unsupported in IE8... strange, seeing as how color: inherit; works fine.
15:20  ZombieLoffe: Oh well
15:20 --- _K1ng_ is now known as K1ng_
15:20  Jackass4D: woah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15:21  aurilliance: ZombieLoffe, what is the matter with w3schools? I like their site
15:21 --- karstensrage is now known as Guest53943
15:21  DrunkMonkeyStyle: aurilliance: http://w3fools.com
15:21  ZombieLoffe: aurilliance, teaches a lot of bad practice, syntax errors in lots of examples, omits important info.
15:22  ZombieLoffe: DrunkMonkeyStyle: Hadn't seen that site before, nice. Will be a handy link in here :)
15:22  DrunkMonkeyStyle: ZombieLoffe: Please do.  I'm thinking of bringing a bot in with updated links suggested by you and oksushi and others, as well.
15:22  ZombieLoffe: Well, we had a good one, but jedimind_ got rid of that.
15:22 * ZombieLoffe shakes fist
15:23  DrunkMonkeyStyle: ZombieLoffe: Haha, yes but riven did scare a lot of people as well. ;)  We'll try to reconstruct one as time goes on.  I just have to get my Perl skillz0rs bettered.
15:23  ZombieLoffe: What's with the nick?
15:24  DrunkMonkeyStyle: ZombieLoffe: I decided to get my Drunken Monkey style drinkFU on.  I think I deserve it after the stupid work I just finished for a client plus dorks in here.
15:27  reecefowell: i have a debugging bar i wrote using php/html, its conditionally included, and its using "position: fixed; top: 10px;" so how do i stop the rest of my webpage from having text under that div WITHOUT specifying any changes to the rest of the documents CSS? is this possible?
15:28  lump`: http://w3fools.com/#html_forms
15:28  lump`: wtf???
15:28  lump`: Non-block-level elements (such as <input>) are not valid directly inside <form> tags until HTML5.
15:29  thnee: when i have an image as display inline, i get a space above the image(like a top margin), even though the container is the exact same height as the image. normally i would display block the image, to remove the margin. however this is not possible because i want to use vertical-align.
15:29  lump`: can someone please explain this to me?
15:29  thnee: where is this space coming from?
15:29  thnee: lump`: w3fools?
15:29  lump`: yes
15:30  thnee: well you need a container
15:30  thnee: like div or p
15:30  lump`: DrunkMonkeyStyle just linked to it, good site. but the above statement just blew my head off
15:30  thnee: thats it
15:30  iaj_: http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=62   could someone help me to get the lowest input box floated next to the one above?? What am I missing?
15:30  lump`: so you must have <form><block><input> ?
15:30  thnee: thats it man
15:30  thnee: you got it
15:30  lump`: why can't you have <form><input>?
15:30  thnee: because it's not allowed
15:30  thnee: as you pasted
15:31  lump`: i've never known that before..
15:31  lump`: what about labels?
15:31  thnee: read the html spec
15:31  lump`: o_O kk
15:31  thnee: what about them?
15:31  lump`: same applies?
15:31  thnee: why would the rule be different?
15:31  lump`: oops misread it
15:31  thnee: only block-level elemens inside form
15:31  lump`: non-block level elements
15:31  lump`: yeh
15:31  lump`: hokay
15:32  lump`: way to make me feel like i've been a complete idiot for the last 5 years
15:32  lump`: GG W3SCHOOLS! FML
15:33  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: I can't think of anything except applying a padding-top the height of the fixed div on the contents of the rest of the site.
15:33  DrunkMonkeyStyle: so #wrapper or whatever it is.
15:33  thnee: well no one is always right
15:33  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Woah, I just got some serious lag text.
15:33  reecefowell: DrunkMonkeyStyle: yeah but i didn't want the page being affected by the debug_bar stuff when not in debug mode
15:33  iaj_: hmms, no one able to tell me why the input(text) box below the PLZ / Ort isn't floated ?
15:33  iaj_: on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=62.
15:34  reecefowell: DrunkMonkeyStyle: but its ok, guess ill just have to do some JS
15:34  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: I don't know maybe some kind of jQuery?  I can't think of anything else that would work dynamically.
15:34  reecefowell: yes am using jQuery and jQuery UI for the debug_bar
15:34  reecefowell: so will try to use that
15:34  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: I hope that works out, very cool idea.
15:34 --- Guest6836 is now known as SpiLoT
15:36  reecefowell: DrunkMonkeyStyle: thanks
15:36  reecefowell: its for my php MVC framework i am building :)
15:36  reecefowell: gonna have lots of useful gadgets in it
15:36  reecefowell: and a visual studio style like error/warning/notice output
15:40  aurilliance: Do the CSS3 animations allow you to animate text colours?
15:44  dravekx: aurilliance, http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/css/50-awesome-css3-animations/
15:44  dravekx: a few ideas of blah.
15:45  Dartfall: How long till CSS3 will be "heavily used"?
15:45  dravekx: Dartfall, about 20 years
15:46  Dartfall: Those effects look awesome ( I know, you can do them some other way, but still :D )
15:46  dravekx: "just because you can, doesn't always mean you should"
15:46  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Damn, I'd love to see that some day.  Sounds really useful actually.
15:47  sriley: you can use them now
15:47  reecefowell: thanks
15:47  dravekx: sriley,  again I say... "just because you can, doesn't mean you should."
15:47  reecefowell: DrunkMonkeyStyle: its not much now, but if you want to bookmark it https://github.com/reecefowell/PHPOnAcid
15:47  dravekx: lol
15:48  sriley: why wouldnt you want to...
15:48  Dartfall: Subtility and function > eye candy, right? :D
15:48  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Thank you I was going to ask how I could keep track of that.  Brilliant.
15:48  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Eyecandy pays more *bitter*
15:48  reecefowell: also DrunkMonkeyStyle theres a forum www.codeconsortium.com where theres a discussion board for updates etc
15:48  dravekx: sriley, because it's not supported by all browsers and it's a waste (at this point in time)
15:48  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Wow, even better.  You got your bases covered.
15:49  reecefowell: thanks
15:49  reecefowell: am trying
15:49 * DrunkMonkeyStyle bookmarks both.
15:49  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: I hear you.  At least you're putting your money where your mouth is.
15:50  reecefowell: lol thanks
15:50  sriley: its supported by most depending on the style
15:50  reecefowell: DrunkMonkeyStyle: its MVC and it has an emphasis on performance, so working hard on that, but building this on my own atm
15:50  sriley: and for those that its not suppoted by, does it matter that cross browser its not 100% the same (youre never gonna get that anyway)
15:50  Forbidd3n: How would I set a div to a set width and force every child inside to constrain to that width regardless of it's size?
15:51  sriley: even ie 5.5 had support for css gradients
15:51  dravekx: ...
15:52 --- gtsafas_ is now known as elb0w
15:52  dravekx: the fact that you said IE in a sentence forces me to get back to work.
15:53  DrunkMonkeyStyle: This CSS3/HTML5 list is by no means completely comprehensive but it gives a basic idea of what is happening: http://www.findmebyip.com/litmus/
15:53  DrunkMonkeyStyle: dravekx: Don't kill the client immediately.  Wait until some time has passed before-hand so the police don't make any connexions.
15:54  sriley: ah another sheep in the anti ie hurd. ignore the fact that it beat other browser developers to things like gradients, transitions, rgba etc
15:54  m0nkfish: i am using float:left on two DIVs two line them up. one DIV contains an image, the other contains text. however, it seems that no matter which order i put the DIVs, the text is always to the left of the image... but i want the image on the left of the text. how can i do this?
15:54  sriley: (by about 10 years)
15:54  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Yeah that's the hard part because you get to deal with all the tech support hell as well.  I hope you have folks who help you with that.  Mates come in very handy for this.
15:55  DrunkMonkeyStyle: It looks like this convo has headed down the same geekrage war as 'What is the best editor?'
15:55  reecefowell: i know a few people, but its just me working on it at this point
15:55  dravekx: sriley, sure it did... that's why other browsers came to the market.
15:55  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Argh, respect.
15:55  Forbidd3n: Is there a way to constrain child elements to parent width even if child width is larger than parent?
15:55  Forbidd3n: so make it wrap
15:56  DrunkMonkeyStyle: m0nkfish: I need some code to look at, can you put a test case in webdevout or give me a live URL?
15:56  reecefowell: thanks, been working on it about a month now, and it already has request/routing matching, it does debug handling, has an autoloader, inheritable controller, template buffering etc
15:56  dravekx: sriley, that's why IE is the most FAILED browser on the market, not to mention, the only reason it's there is because it's included with the Windows package without choice.
15:57  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Forbidd3n: Where is your test case?  The question is out of context.
15:57  dravekx: average people are too stupid to realize there are better browsers.
15:57  sriley: lol
15:57  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Damn, I can't wait to check that out when I'm sober.
15:57  reecefowell: haha
15:57  sriley: yes there are better browsers but that doesnt make ie a failed browser
15:58  reecefowell: well make an account on the board if you like
15:58  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: I sure will.  Hell I might even use this nick haha.
15:58  reecefowell: i hope so :)
15:59  reecefowell: its not ready for use yet though, but am slaving away on it :P
15:59  DrunkMonkeyStyle: reecefowell: Mate, watch your health. =)
16:00  reecefowell: lol will do :P

16:00  skrypets_: thats the issue http://jsfiddle.net/skrypets/qA2xw/
16:02  sriley: skrypets_: a working example is really considerably better than a simple paste of code
16:02  skrypets_: yes for sure , but it's closed project )
16:03  sriley: as i said before i suspect you have position:relative on something giving ie a new zindex stack and thats why its breaking

16:03 * DrunkMonkeyStyle is suddenly reminded of geocities.
16:04  aurilliance: Huh. I was building something like jsfiddle a while ago. Never finished it.
16:04  sriley: i suspect if you put * {z-index:1;} other browsers will look the same as ie (thats essentially what ie will be doing)
16:04  sriley: aurilliance: theres lots of them
16:05  aurilliance: I was gonna call it JS&&box - as in JSandBox (Java Script Sand Box)
16:05  dumont: JSS&BOX?
16:06  aurilliance: dumont, JS&&box. two ampersands.
16:06  aurilliance: Why?
16:06  dumont: 2 don't make sense

16:07  m0nkfish: how can i convince my outer DIV to wrap around a floating inner DIV?
16:08  DrunkMonkeyStyle: m0nkfish: As I asked you before please present a test case using webdevout or a live URL.
16:08  m0nkfish: ok let me find out what this webdevout thing it
16:08  DrunkMonkeyStyle: m0nkfish: url is in the topic.

16:57  Forbidd3n: but the el-select is takign what is in main for the element

17:24  rob_zelnr: is it bad form to assign the same value to ID parameter and NAME parameter ?
17:25  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Yes.
17:25  rob_zelnr: I have this  <BODY OnLoad="document.DataEntryForm.firstname.focus(); >
17:25  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: This is #css btw.
17:25  rob_zelnr: oh, should that be asked in ?
17:25  rob_zelnr: HTML ? or Javascript ?
17:25  rob_zelnr: I figured with the DOM issue involved, CSS would be the best pick
17:26  rob_zelnr: since CSS is really all about DOM references in my mind.
17:26  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: #javascript I reckon.  CSS isn't javascript - javascript is often used for the DOM to pick out ID's in CSS but your question is best directed at #javascript.
17:26  rob_zelnr: clearer
17:26  speak: yes that is definitely a javascript issue :)
17:27  dravekx: yeah... pull ova that, whoop, too phat.
17:27  rob_zelnr: I DO look at CSS as to 'presentation'.
17:27  Milossh: hello: is there any way to prevent inheritance with inline styles?
17:27  rob_zelnr: any CSS experts care to chime in and attempt to 'nutshell' CSS ?
17:27  DrunkMonkeyStyle: dravekx: Drop lsd in your client's drink.
17:27  rob_zelnr: I like to think of CSS as XLS
17:27  dravekx: Milossh !important
17:28  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Better specificity.
17:28  Milossh: dravekx: nope, prevent a child elements from inheriting parent's style
17:28  rob_zelnr: sorry, XSL, eeks.
17:28  Milossh: while I'm styling parent inline
17:28  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: You're zany.
17:28  dravekx: Milossh, that's like incest.
17:28  Milossh: hehe
17:28  rob_zelnr: I never got the 'cascading' part.  Perhaps suggesting a hierarchy ?
17:29  DrunkMonkeyStyle: ]speficity @ rob_zelnr
17:29  DrunkMonkeyStyle: ]specificity @ rob_zelnr
17:29  DrunkMonkeyStyle: God I hate that bot.
17:29  Milossh: so, any way to achieve
17:29  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Better specificity.
17:29  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I don't get that?
17:29  dravekx: ]css speficity
17:29  speak: DrunkMonkeyStyle i've always wondered how people here remember the bot commands
17:29  rob_zelnr: although I'm skipping my original question - might as well ask (I just woke up, so I'm into just learning like a sponge, I'll wring it out later!)
17:30  dravekx: ha
17:30  jedimind: hrm serbia has .rs as their TLD now ?
17:30  DrunkMonkeyStyle: speak: I do too now.
17:30  jedimind: crazy
17:30  rob_zelnr: how is CSS different from XSL ?
17:30  dravekx: stupid bot. I keel you.
17:30  jedimind: when'd that happen
17:30  rob_zelnr: er, could you do everything with XSL that you could do with CSS ?
17:30  DrunkMonkeyStyle: MediaGuy: Can you answer rob_zelnr before I need to open another beer?
17:30  DrunkMonkeyStyle: MediaGuy: == jedimind
17:31 * DrunkMonkeyStyle is obviously filled with drunk at the moment.
17:31  rob_zelnr: seems XSL would be the proper way, just curious, that's all,  it is what it is, and the little bit I've learned using CSS is terrific to help abstract presentation from content, one of the original goals at CERN I read for the creators of HTML.
17:31  jedimind: what shis problem?
17:31  jedimind: i dont see the question
17:31  rob_zelnr: jedimind- lol
17:31  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I have like <div>bla1<p>bla2</p></div>, and I want to apply font size only to bla. How can I do it?
17:31  DrunkMonkeyStyle: jedimind: He's scaring me by asking if CSS is XSL.
17:31  rob_zelnr: jedimind- question right now is- in geneal, how does CSS differ from XSL ?
17:31  dravekx: he had chicken pot pie for breakfast.
17:31  Milossh: *bla1
17:31  rob_zelnr: Cascading vs Extensible ?
17:32  iaj: hmm, http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=62   can someone tell me how to get the 2 checkboxes floated next to Eigene Werkstatt?
17:32  jedimind: rob_zelnr, well it differs in the same way that an elephant and a car are different
17:32  rob_zelnr: both do weigh a lot !
17:32  rob_zelnr: jk - I'm all ears
17:32  rob_zelnr: er, all elephant ears - heh jk jk
17:32  jedimind: yup, just like in this case, both CSS and XSL use the keyboard alphabet
17:32  dravekx: rob_zelnr, The RULE OF THUMB IS: "Use CSS when you can, use XSL when you must."
17:32  jedimind: but they have completely different purposes
17:32  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: put bla1 into <p></p> and add a class to it.  Why is bla1 outside of an element?
17:33  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Or put bla1 inside a span tag.
17:33  rob_zelnr: jedimind - I see CSS as to presentation, and XSL for manipulation of XML for content, but ultimately- even CSS should be ? XML ? and therefore under domain of XSL ?
17:33  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I'm working with other elements, that's just simplified case
17:33  dravekx: ugh, semantics.
17:34  DrunkMonkeyStyle: symantecs
17:34  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I can't. it's XUL, I'm working on something
17:34  skylamer`: DrunkMonkeyStyle or he can make first child of the div with some class to have some settings :D)
17:34  rob_zelnr: I mean, CSS is all about rules for tags ?   Use of <h1>  in document if declared in CSS as a STYLE means that all H1 'tag' gets modified in any use, to however it was declared in the CSS STYLE definition.
17:35  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Add a style to the div parent that affects bla1 and make sure the child P of the div has a style for that set in specificity.
17:35  rob_zelnr: I'm just wondering if XSL works this way too... That you can 'alter' 'tags' -
17:35  dravekx: It's like a political debate over who has the bigger penis vs who IS the bigger penis.
17:35  rob_zelnr: I guess I'm seeing HTML tags are nothing more than XML tags -
17:35  rob_zelnr: something is screwed up in my head- that's for sure.
17:35  DrunkMonkeyStyle: HTML came first!
17:35  DrunkMonkeyStyle: :D
17:35  rob_zelnr: nice T-shirt model there Drunk
17:35  rob_zelnr: er, bumper sticker !
17:35  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Chicken and egg *bah dah boom*
17:35  rob_zelnr: Drunk- I DID figure out the chicken and the egg.
17:36  rob_zelnr: The answer is not what you'd think.
17:36  rob_zelnr: but I did figure that one out.
17:36  rob_zelnr: It's really a problem about state.
17:36  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I know all of those, I'm just unable to do anything of that, I just need an inline styling which won't affect child elements
17:36  rob_zelnr: the chicken and the egg are one - the same.
17:36  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: What I think is unknown.
17:36  rob_zelnr: just at different temporal states.
17:36  rob_zelnr: Anyway- not here to get into the chicken or the egg.
17:36  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Then do an inline style thing.  What exactly is the problem?
17:36  dravekx: the chicken came first.
17:36  rob_zelnr: damn it dravekx - I've worked through this one, I can't go back there !
17:37  dravekx: an egg cant lay a chicken. get it?
17:37  rob_zelnr: heh, anyway, I do recall when this 'cascading style sheets' came out in the late 90's well - that's when I noticed it.   I explored it.  I didn't see the forest from the trees
17:37 * DrunkMonkeyStyle is concerned about Milossh's strange lack of test case URL/live URL and extremely general question.
17:37  rob_zelnr: (I figured that one out too, if a tree falls in the woods ? My answer now is 'what tree')
17:37  rob_zelnr: BUT - as to CSS now ?
17:37  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: not possible
17:38  rob_zelnr: Is CSS really about altering tag's 'properties' ?
17:38  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: child elements do not inherit inline styles?
17:38  dravekx: rob_zelnr, wait... it gets better as time goes on. The evil fairies come out and want 10 year support.
17:38  speak: inline styles... why?
17:38  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Then I have no idea :)  I've never done that in my life.  Somebody else might be able to tell you that but inline styles are something I shun and never do.
17:38  rob_zelnr: dravekx - 10 year support ?  Well, that's certainly not a Microsoft Product.
17:39  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: thanks
17:39  dravekx: speak, if you dont plan on using css again for that specific tag, why not?
17:39  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: G'luck.
17:39  speak: plans change
17:39  speak: that's the whole idea
17:39  rob_zelnr: someone should make a comic of a developer looking at a new MS product or technology- showing the data of Jan 1, 2011 on the desk, and on the box ? or white papers ? Product expires on Jan 2/2011.
17:40  dravekx: rob_zelnr, explain people trying to get IE6 support then.
17:40  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: I have AN asnwer for you: Try it and see.
17:40  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Damn, where'd my beer go?
17:40  rob_zelnr: Anyway- I'll start with a BETTER question that will get me to CSS.    HTML came out, then XML became a buzzword,  then I realized SGML was out, and all these other 'markup lanugages' then XML came in to be the 'generic' reference to 'any markup' language, and it merely required a DTD (or Scheme back to MS).      Is it FAIR to say ?  HTML IS JUST XML with a DTD  ?    And from there I'll ask about
17:40  rob_zelnr: CSS ?
17:40  rob_zelnr: didn't mean that last question mark.
17:40 * speak hides the empty bottle from DrunkMonkeyStyle 
17:40  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Empty??
17:41  DrunkMonkeyStyle: :|
17:41 * speak burps
17:41  rob_zelnr: well, after the 13th beer, the empty ones start to become the problem ?
17:41  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: You have way too much time right now.
17:41  rob_zelnr: I'm not even going to explore that one.
17:41  rob_zelnr: Drunk - benefits of being unemployed !
17:41  rob_zelnr: AND unemployable !
17:41  rob_zelnr: thye keep firing me for chatting too much in these damn chat rooms.
17:41  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Pay that internet bill.
17:41  dravekx: empty bottles should replace full ones, then it's not messy.
17:42  rob_zelnr: Drunkmonkey - someone should come out with a hop skip jump model that lets you parasite off your neighbor's connection, and if they don't have one ? you go down the street until you find one, THEN, you place a few intermediary to bounce that signal all the way back home to daddy.
17:43  rob_zelnr: strange European countries believe broadband access to their citizens is a RIGHT - and it's free.
17:43  rob_zelnr: anyways though,  where does CSS fit into things ?
17:43  rob_zelnr: CSS is closer to 'shaping' tags ?
17:44  iaj: http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=62  how could I get the radio button next to the text? ?
17:44  rob_zelnr: I mean, I GET that you want to abstract presentation out of the tags themselves.
17:45  Tempus2: Hi, I am wondering. In Windows 7, how does the system font settings do to the fonts on webpages?
17:45  jedimind: sorry im actually triyng to get work done and not really paying attention here
17:45  rob_zelnr: iaj- I'm not the one to answer, but what about absolute positioning ?
17:45  rob_zelnr: jedimind - ah - I suppose I could return to my problem... I'll go ask in javascript.
17:46  sriley: system font wont change anything the browser font settings will potentially change web pages (ie potentially uses the system font)
17:46  rob_zelnr: but I do want to understand conceptually what CSS is -  the way I look at things now (and that is always subject to change) is - HTML is really 'yet one more' expression of XML, and I see HTML as really being about the DTD.   As to CSS ? I lok at it as XSL in concept,  dynamically altering xml tags.
17:46  rob_zelnr: just happens that browser take that information and use it for presentation.
17:46  rob_zelnr: but it's just media to me.
17:47  rob_zelnr: I just want to sort it all out.
17:47  Tempus2: It's the other way around rob
17:47  rob_zelnr: I do recommend that Caribou Morning blend coffee though -
17:47  rob_zelnr: I'm 1/2 wired already from 1 cup.
17:47  rob_zelnr: hmm - other way around ?
17:48  rob_zelnr: is it CSS sets up rules for tag parameters ?
17:48  rob_zelnr: basically ?
17:48  Tempus2: If you think HTML is a yet another expression of XML
17:48  Tempus2: HTML is yet another expression of SGML
17:48  rob_zelnr: I do recall SGML
17:49  rob_zelnr: but - Standard Government Markup Language then - is yet another form of XML, yes ?
17:49  Tempus2: No
17:49  Tempus2: Not at all
17:49  rob_zelnr: oh ?  oh my.
17:49  speak: rob_zelnr what is your point with all of this?
17:49  rob_zelnr: to think clearer.
17:49  rob_zelnr: speak- that's a big one - to miss that, if I have.
17:49  Tempus2: HTML = SGML, XHTML = XML
17:49  rob_zelnr: I was thinking XML is a way to say - ANY ML.
17:50  Tempus2: If you think of HTML as a sub-expression
17:50  rob_zelnr: tempus2- so, XML isn't a way of saying the X means, ANY markup language ?  I thought the idea was to say - here is a container conceptually for ALL markup lanugages-   X  ML.
17:50  DrunkMonkeyStyle: iaj: What does firebug say?
17:50  Tempus2: eXtensible Markup Language
17:51  rob_zelnr: and then it's just X (any) Markup Language will have a DTD.
17:51 --- monsterkiller is now known as MonsterKiller
17:51  Tempus2: XML doesn't need a DTD
17:51  Tempus2: Unless it's a specific language like XHTML
17:52  Tempus2: XML is XML, in your own form, or in the form of XHTML or a Winamp skin.
17:52  rob_zelnr: I currently look at XSL as a passive means to 'change' the markup - or  'shape it', and I look at XSLT as an active means to change the markup - or transform it.
17:52  rob_zelnr: but I am juvenile at best in these formulations.
17:52  rob_zelnr: I do understand that
17:52  theconartist: ....
17:53  rob_zelnr: which is why I was tapping what others thought here- as I'm sure there are some here that do get all of this, where I'm still in the shallow waters.
17:53  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Right, time for more beer.
17:53  Tempus2: None of these things "do" anything, they instruct the browser how to show things
17:53  rob_zelnr: Tempus - I just realized you point that XML doesn't NEED a DTD.
17:54  Tempus2: WHile javascript "do" things
17:54  rob_zelnr: are you saying, with XML and a DTD ? you can't completely represent HTML or SGML ?
17:55  Tempus2: They are two different markup languages
17:55  rob_zelnr: tempus2 - I do get the client/server scripting.
17:55  Tempus2: XML and SGML
17:55  Forbidd3n: anyone know how I can make a clean url with js as the user is typing in the page title
17:55  rob_zelnr: so, it's not correct to say SGML IS a form of XML ?
17:55  rob_zelnr: I think my 'semantics' are off here.
17:55  Forbidd3n: for instance - Energy Savings would turn into energy-savings
17:55  Tempus2: "typing in the page title"?
17:55  rob_zelnr: I am starting to get this clearer.
17:55  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Forbidd3n: I'm not sure that's appropriate for CSS - that's regarding a mod-rewrite.
17:55  rob_zelnr: My error I think has been thinking X stands for ANY.
17:56  Forbidd3n: sorry wrong chan
17:56  rob_zelnr: so I just need to trim it down to ML then.
17:56  rob_zelnr: But as to CSS
17:56  rob_zelnr: CSS is deeply tied to the DTD, right ?
17:56  rob_zelnr: and - hmm- while I don't use SGML ? Is CSS as valid for SGML as it is for HTML ?
17:56  Tempus2: Yes
17:57  Tempus2: For HTML
17:57  rob_zelnr: should I look at CSS as technically nothing to do with presentation, but really, tag parameter rules ?
17:57  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Forbidd3n: http://corz.org/serv/tricks/htaccess.php
17:57  rob_zelnr: hmm- I'm not quite there yet on just what CSS is I suppose.
17:57  rob_zelnr: CSS is about ?     A.  Altering Element parameters ?  B.  something else ?
17:58  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr:  CSS is about maintenance of Long Distance Ballistic Missiles.  Simple.
17:58  rob_zelnr: ah - maybe C.  Setting up a hierarchy for class structures that can be inherited by elements ?
17:58  rob_zelnr: Ddrunk - no, that's ICBMGML
17:58  Tempus2: the <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> should say a bit
17:59  rob_zelnr: hmm-
17:59  Tempus2: You appearntly do not know much about web-history and how webpages have been made through the years
18:00  rob_zelnr: Tempus- I recall when Mosaic came out, then Microsoft introduced Internet explorer, and the splash screen ? showed MOSAIC.  lol
18:00  Tempus2: There wasn't any CSS in the first HTML versions
18:00  rob_zelnr: I also used to use lynx before that.
18:00  rob_zelnr: that is correct.
18:00 --- Guest53943 is now known as karstensrage
18:00  rob_zelnr: As I said, I recall seeing CSS show up in the late 90's for me.
18:00  rob_zelnr: It was all the buzz.  But I didn't 'get' it - or I didn't see the forest from the trees on that.
18:00 --- karstensrage is now known as Guest68272
18:00  rob_zelnr: Now that I come back into HTML after 10 years off, I see the value - however, I'm just trying to 'get' what it really is I'm working with.
18:01  Tempus2: In practice you don't need CSS at all, it just makes webpages easier to design
18:01  rob_zelnr: I could see that.
18:01  rob_zelnr: Oh, I think I get it.
18:01  rob_zelnr: I've learned one thing here at least.
18:01  rob_zelnr: It's the STYLE parameter.
18:01  Tempus2: or <link>
18:01  rob_zelnr: And ONE issue designers (I'm not a web designer though) like is they can put all of the STYLE attributes in one big file.
18:02  Tempus2: I use <link>-tags
18:02  rob_zelnr: rather than sift through line by line for each element.
18:02  rob_zelnr: right right -
18:02  rob_zelnr: I have been advised to abstract all the CSS from the HTML document -
18:03  rob_zelnr: and I have read that this makes it easier to really 'transport' or make use of one 'style' and apply it to another document.
18:03  rob_zelnr: So, that's one goal, document presentation independence.
18:03  Tempus2: The difference on XML and HTML, and XHTML is that they're put together differently
18:03  rob_zelnr: Is it fair to say CSS is STRICTLY about presentation ?
18:03  rob_zelnr: ok, how about this, tell me if I'm making more sense,   CSS is to HTML as XSL is to XML ?
18:04  Tempus2: To put it this way: If you're a really good designer, your pages represent the same data with and without style in an informative way.
18:04  rob_zelnr: where HTML is about content delivery for browsers,   XML typically is about content delivery for databases or applications.
18:04  rob_zelnr: Tempus2 - that's about what I read is the best.
18:04  Tempus2: XML = Content
18:05  rob_zelnr: CSS = ?
18:05  DrunkMonkeyStyle: HOW content is delivered to browsers.
18:05  rob_zelnr: Supportive meta data for content ?
18:05  Tempus2: CSS represent what is not content
18:05  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Presentational application of the HTML elements as shown in delivery.
18:06  rob_zelnr: ok
18:06  rob_zelnr: this is all clearer.   To me atleast.
18:06  rob_zelnr: thankyou tempus2 for walking through that.
18:06  Tempus2: HTML and XHTML have very similar content, and the tag-names are the same. XML however is different, cept that it uses a markup language
18:07  rob_zelnr: I thought I read HTML became XHTML ? and HTML is no more ? So you're saying HTML still exists.
18:07  Tempus2: Very few pages actually uses XML though
18:07  Tempus2: HTML is as real as can be
18:07  Tempus2: <!doctype html> is current version
18:08  rob_zelnr: To me, I'd think every page should be generated via XML, and I'd think you could use XSL to handle preparing the XML to be transformed into HTML and XSLT to automate the entire most of what would normally be hand coded in CSS.
18:08  Tempus2: Well, it's up to you
18:08  rob_zelnr: that is, seems XML could be used to represent ANY ML- SGML, XHTML, HTML,  even CSS, and of course, the content itself- which I think should ultimately be derived form a database or data source.
18:09  Tempus2: It can't represent HTML
18:09  Tempus2: Nor SGML
18:09  rob_zelnr: But that would give a very automated explication process for any presentation - but I don't think that's realistic.
18:09  rob_zelnr: sure it could though.
18:09  Tempus2: It can represent XHTML
18:09  rob_zelnr: Just inherit the DTD from HTML
18:09  rob_zelnr: ?  no ?
18:09  Tempus2: No
18:10  rob_zelnr: I mean, there are no limitations to how many tags you can use in XML ?
18:10  Tempus2: google html vs xhtml
18:10  rob_zelnr: I will start there
18:10  rob_zelnr: I DO need to understand the difference between those two.
18:10  Tempus2: appearantly
18:10  Tempus2: You can probably find all you need to know on wikipedia
18:11  rob_zelnr: a few  lines at w3schools - In addition, you should start NOW to write your HTML code in lowercase letters, and NEVER skip closing tags (like </p>).
18:11  rob_zelnr: I do say- THIS is the cause of theproblem I came in with - heh
18:11  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: W3Schools is not an authority on anything.
18:11  rob_zelnr: I had used caps - which explains why IE is showing the error probably -
18:11  rob_zelnr: but I'm continuing to read.
18:11  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: http://w3fools.com
18:11  rob_zelnr: oh, ok, I'll try another link.
18:12  Tempus2: M
18:12  rob_zelnr: http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/htmlxhtml
18:12  rob_zelnr: this one looks germane
18:12  Tempus2: My latest web-page can generate both HTML and XHTML, since IE doesn't support XHTML, it gets HTML instead
18:12  rob_zelnr: I see  a lot of tempus2's points here I think.
18:13  Tempus2: It's a while since I made it do so though, if it would be now, I'd just generate HTML
18:15  masterm11: Hi
18:15  masterm11: I've got a problem with my Homepage
18:15  masterm11: http://euhus.1aspace.net/
18:15  masterm11: see unter the picture
18:15  masterm11: theres a News
18:15  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: which answer do you have for me?
18:16  masterm11: But its to long
18:16  masterm11: how to make it "static" ?
18:16  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: As I said before: Try to do an inline in your HTML and see if the child elements inherit it's properties.
18:17  rob_zelnr: Standard Generalized Markup Language - YIKEs - I've been calling it Government -
18:17  rob_zelnr: lol
18:17  Milossh: DrunkMonkeyStyle: I tried, they do.
18:17  Tempus2: "unter"
18:17  Tempus2: ?
18:17  rob_zelnr: humility of the intellect ! :)
18:18  masterm11: sorry
18:18  masterm11: under
18:18  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Milossh: Okay then it sounds like your question was answered.  Otherwise I have no idea what you have been asking. :)
18:18  masterm11: under the picture
18:19  masterm11: the long AAAAAAAAAAA's
18:19  Tempus2: Ah I see
18:19  masterm11: if i didn't make a break
18:19  masterm11: the size of that Table does bigger and bigger
18:20  Tempus2: #lipsum p{ width: 400px; } for instance
18:20  masterm11: oh dear, my english
18:20  Tempus2: Or I didn't measure it, but you can probably do the measuring yourself ;)
18:21  masterm11: ;)  yes i tryed a lot but nothing worked.
18:21  masterm11: <div style="width:600px;" position:fixed; overflow:scroll; white-space:pre; >
18:21  masterm11: thats how it lokes linke now
18:21  Tempus2: remove white-space: pre
18:21  rob_zelnr: well gee Tempus2 - you point out MS IE doesn't support XHTML -which allows for shorthand notation on empty tags such as <br/>    but when I use Visual Studio Web Developer Express from MS ? it puts in the short hand for tags such as <br/> - WTGDMF... Why does MS create XHTML if XHTML isn't support by MS.
18:22  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Ooo, you use $5 words like 'germane'.  Clever.
18:22  Tempus2: It supports shorthand tags
18:22  rob_zelnr: Drunk - I got 'germane' from a $6 manager
18:22  Tempus2: It just doesn't support the XHTML file-type
18:22  masterm11: is removed
18:22  rob_zelnr: so, it accepts XHTML tagging in an HTML document ?
18:22  masterm11: but nothing changed
18:23  rob_zelnr: DrunkMoney- try 'germane' for a few years,  it works nice.   I'm ready to move on, got any $6 words ?
18:23  rob_zelnr: I liked the $3 word 'Ancillary'
18:23  rob_zelnr: oh, and the $9 word 'Dis-intermediate'
18:24  rob_zelnr: 'letters setters and getters' would probably go for $3.50 on wordbay (hmm an ebay for words, I do wonder... it's often a useless idea tht turns into a 3 billion enterprise).
18:24  Tempus2: IE supports short-hand tags yes
18:24  masterm11: hmm i dind't find out :(
18:25  rob_zelnr: ok, so IE supports short-hand tags.
18:25  Tempus2: It also supports XML
18:25  rob_zelnr: I'm still reading on difference between the two - this helps.
18:25  rob_zelnr: HOPEFULLY at the end of the day- I'll have an understanding of what the term 'cascading' refers perhaps.
18:25  rob_zelnr: 'inherits' comes to mind.
18:25  Tempus2: And it also support XHTML doctype, keeping it from going into quirks mode, but if you send a file-type XHTML from a server, it doesn't support it
18:26  Tempus2: It wants to download it
18:26  Tempus2: The "Save file as.." dialog comes up
18:26  Tempus2: In which I feed it HTML instead
18:26  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Your money words are loverly.
18:26  Tempus2: so it doesn't show that dialog
18:27  rob_zelnr: reading that page there showing the differences, it points out A conforming XML document must be well formed... Which got me to thinking, if people were xml docs ?  I bet very few would be well formed.
18:27  Tempus2: A lot of them are, because there are validators which makes sure you do it right
18:28  Tempus2: Firefox is a browser that neglects to show XML which isn't well-formed
18:28  Tempus2: It will display the error instead of rendering the document
18:28  rob_zelnr: in answer to earlier quetsion - what is all of this about,  I guess I just want to help make sure my concepts of CSS/HTML/XML/SGML/XSL/XSLT are well formed.
18:28  rob_zelnr: oh, I never noticed firefox doesn't show XML that isn't well formed.
18:29  Tempus2: It will
18:29  rob_zelnr: I get into XML then stopped using it -   one industry I worked in ?  the whole sha-bang and bonus of XML was to be that everyone could share information using one DTD,  just about every corporation created their own DTD and it was back to square one.
18:29  Tempus2: It's called the YSOD and is feared by the money-making business
18:29  rob_zelnr: YSOD ?
18:30  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Something something of Death.
18:30  Tempus2: http://www.google.com/search?btnG=1&pws=0&q=YSOD
18:30  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Blimey I better be careful, I've had a lot of beers.
18:30  rob_zelnr: loverly eh.
18:30  FastJack: http://ekelias.soup.io/post/102801629/Bild hehe
18:31  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Yesh and there's more where that came from.
18:31  rob_zelnr: Drunk- have you written your congress people lately ?  Today might be a good day ! JK
18:31  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Anybody called 'FastJack' posting random links in a channel makes me nervous.
18:31  speak: rob_zelnr even better is making html & css for clients
18:31  rob_zelnr: yesh sounds alcohol related.   But Loverly - is as to 'cleverly' is as to hmmm.
18:31  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: I recently moved out of the US and I don't need to bother with caring about them anymore.
18:32  FastJack: DrunkMonkeyStyle: it's funny and somehow on-topic :)
18:32  DrunkMonkeyStyle: FastJack: Jasså?  E det bilder eller?
18:32  rob_zelnr: oh, I've gotten this YSOD
18:32  FastJack: eh?
18:32  rob_zelnr: I only used Classic ASP for a long time, then moving to ASP.NET I got YSOD - well I haven't gotten anything BUT YSOD so far.
18:32  rob_zelnr: I have to change the webconfig file
18:33  rob_zelnr: it's on my list of things to do
18:33  rob_zelnr: I'm just fearing by the time I move to ASP.NET they'll drop it and move onto something else.
18:33  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Nope, you've still got a lot of work waiting for you, there.
18:33  rob_zelnr: all of my Jquery autocomplete examples are in ASP.net - which isn't good for me - I have NOT gotten this JSON structure down yet.
18:34  rob_zelnr: Drunken - lol.    I see FastJack's URL is .io  - no clue on that country.
18:34  rob_zelnr: I have a rule Drunken - any girl name + a number is a guy that's 42 and overweight - take Linda23
18:35  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Ah, explains it.  Night of the Living Dead.  All of my favourite people come from there.  Remember 'The Five' with Reid.
18:36  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Damn I'm a fat guy but not quite 42.
18:36  rob_zelnr: FastJack though - says Italy.  I find Italians to be quirky sometimes,  and in general having nice audio production software - I'm not biased.  But I bet Amanda Knox is CIA.
18:36  DrunkMonkeyStyle: s/./?/
18:37  rob_zelnr: Drunk - just pick another planet - you can be 42 - or better - pick another base.   Anyway - back to reading on this xhtml difference.  I want to get my arms around CSS today- then I'll her to polka !
18:37  DrunkMonkeyStyle: I'll try clicking the link.
18:37  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Damn, you don't remember 'The Five'. :(
18:37  DrunkMonkeyStyle: I am one of the rare people persons who knows why they are called that.
18:38  DrunkMonkeyStyle: Right, I will now away for dinner and a bit of sobering up.
18:38  DrunkMonkeyStyle: rob_zelnr: Good luck with your adventures.
18:39  buddyq: hey so specifity question: I have main wrapper div for nav bar called #navigation and a style such as #navigation ul li a. So now i'm making the submenus and styling them. I have just .submenu .level1>li a which seems it would be more specific since .submenu is inside #navigation and only .level1 is inside .submenu but the rule is still being overruled by #navigation ul li a. Why is that not more specific?
18:54  Iceshifter: Does anyone know of a common reason for a PHP/HTML document to not accept inline or external CSS ?
18:55  Iceshifter: The external css usually is due to the link being incorrect, but this document won't accept inline styling either.
18:55  Iceshifter: Any idea what could cause this?

19:04  dunkel2[iPad]: Is it possible to add a background image only with other class and do not affect a colour set in another class to that object?
19:06  Tempus2: background images doesn't set a color mate
19:07  dunkel2[iPad]: I want to have <a class="class1 class2"> the class 1 sets a gradient colour and in the class2 i just want to set an image
19:07  ravenzz: backbround-image
19:07  ravenzz: ?
19:07  dunkel2[iPad]: So
19:07  dunkel2[iPad]: I did that but it removes my colours
19:08  dunkel2[iPad]: Maybe the gradient is the problem
19:08  dunkel2[iPad]: Because i set that just with background:
19:08  oojacoboo: anyone know if it's possible to make an element both fixed and relative at the same time?
19:08  oojacoboo: without replicating the html
19:08  oojacoboo: or simulating this somehow

19:13  dunkel2[iPad]: I tought i can just add another class with the image as far as all my buttons will be same colours

19:21  m0nkfish: just ask ;)
19:21  salientKnight: I am trying to get two content block to sit next to each other ...
19:21  salientKnight: but the right most block is always displayed on the right but down by the height of the left box
19:22  salientKnight: when I move it up using margin that works, but not is all browsers
19:22  salientKnight: there is a difference of 5px or so between renderings
19:22  salientKnight: any ideas?

19:23  salientKnight: hi
19:23  dunkel2: i would need to write all the background colour lines to each class
19:23  Q-FUNK: I seem to have problems keeping the 3 white cells at equal width.  any ide what I'm doing wrong?
19:24  salientKnight: Q did you use a width: style?
19:24  dunkel2: there is no way to inherit all the content of a previous defined class right?
19:24  Q-FUNK: yes, all 3 white sections (menu, content, footer) use 900px width
19:25  salientKnight: dunke if you put it in a CSS file that is included by all of your documents
19:25  salientKnight: every page will use it
19:25  dunkel2: yeah but let me pastie it
19:28  dunkel2: look i have this http://www.pastie.org/1474400
19:29  dunkel2: .btn-add that class is removing my background colour
19:31  Q-FUNK: found.  odd.  specifying text-size: 77%; for those two cells was the cause.
19:32  dunkel2: any idea of my problem :/

20:41  salientKnight: I have a float right and left on the same line, with 20px to spare in the margins (including the padding etc) yet my right float in showing up down by the left float height... any idea how to fix this without doing a negotive top margin?
20:42  oksushi: give it enough room
20:42  salientKnight: it should have enough room
20:42  salientKnight: but about 20px
20:42  oksushi: but it doesn't
20:42  salientKnight: by
20:42  oksushi: you can give the url to the page if you like
20:43  salientKnight: its not world accessible

20:44  tellerfisch: is it possible to select the a seconds class in a document?
20:44  oksushi: tellerfisch: that makes no sense
20:44  oksushi: try rephrasing the question
20:44  tellerfisch: oksushi, why?
20:44  oksushi: 'a seconds class'
20:44  tellerfisch: is it possible to select the second class in a document?
20:45  gnarf: what is the second class?
20:45  gnarf: the second element with that class?
20:45  oksushi: second class of what?
20:45  tellerfisch: ,foo
20:45  salientKnight: oksushi, does it matter that I have display:block? should I use something else?
20:45  tellerfisch: gnarf, yes
20:45  oksushi: salientKnight: no
20:45  gnarf: $('.class').eq(1)
20:45  salientKnight: didn't think so
20:45  tellerfisch: no jQuery :D
20:45  foo: tellerfisch: what?
20:45  gnarf: tellerfisch: then get out of #jquery

20:46  gnarf: oh
20:46  gnarf: wow
20:46  gnarf: i fail
20:46 * gnarf apologizes
20:46  gnarf: tellerfisch: i'm pretty sure there isn't any selector that would approximate the :eq from jquery
20:47  tellerfisch: hm
20:47  gnarf: if you could rely on them being :nth-child(2)
20:47  gnarf: maybe
20:47  tellerfisch: the two class are siblings
20:47  oksushi: tellerfisch: try .className:nth-of-type(2)
20:47  gnarf: nice
20:48  oksushi: tellerfisch: no idea if that would work. If you can provide the url to the page there may be a more appropriate selector

21:34  matt___: what im trying to do is, cover the bottom two rows of a table up with a div
21:35  matt___: so ive wrapped the entire table in a <div position:relative>, <div position:absolute, bottom:0; left:0;; width 90%>
21:35  matt___: (the table has 2 columns, first column = 90% width, second column 10%)
21:36  matt___: problem is it looks perfect in firefox and chrome. looks wonky in IE

22:16  foo: In Firebug, does the "Edit" button ever appear not clickable after you do X? I've experienced this bug for years and it's either very annoying, or there is some PEBKAC going on here.

22:31  dravekx: so this guy walks into a bar...
22:33  dravekx: and says he's a professional web designer. So I say, really. What do you use for designing? and he says web builder 7.

22:36  matt___: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/tables.html#emptycells
22:36  matt___: does anyone have a suggestion of how i can mimick empty-cells for ie5-ie7?
22:38  eighty4: ie5?
22:39  matt___: eighty4: well i dont care about ie5
22:39  matt___: ie6 though :)
22:40  zezikaro: why do you care about ie6
22:41  matt___: zezikaro: i thought it was required by work
22:41  matt___: but forget i mentioned it. how about 7?
22:42  zezikaro: why do you care about ie7
22:42  matt___: zezikaro: i'm trying to lax my requirements here :)
22:42  matt___: ie7 is needed by work though
22:43  zezikaro: you want to have empty cells?
22:43  zezikaro: leave them empty then that should be enough
22:44  zezikaro: or do you want the hide part
22:44  matt___: zezikaro: i want to hide them entirely
22:44  matt___: im trying to cover the cells with a div
22:44  oksushi: ew
22:45  matt___: positioned bottom left, the width % is getting screwed up though from browser to browser
22:45  matt___: oksushi: im open to suggestions on a better idea !
22:45  oksushi: sounds like you have an x y problem
22:46  zezikaro: depending on the circumstances you could use display:none
22:46  matt___: zezikaro: on each td element?
22:46  matt___: i think i tried that. let me try it again
22:47  zezikaro: well it depends on which ones you're trying to hide :P
22:53  chatzilla: hi
22:54  chatzilla: is it possible to achieve the following without tables?:  an inline navigation and a div that fills the rest of the full width that is not taken by the navigation
22:54  chatzilla: like the following:
22:54  chatzilla: | link1  link2  link3  link4  ---------div---------- |
22:55  chatzilla: | link1 link2 link3 ------------div------------- |
22:55  chatzilla: args, you know what i mean
22:55  oksushi: chatzilla: yes
22:56  chatzilla: how?
22:56  oksushi: the navigation would be marked up as a list. Float the list left.
22:56  oksushi: put 'overflow: hidden' on the div
22:57  dravekx: someone send me a link to their website portfolio, I need a few "picture" references as to what one looks like
22:58  chatzilla: oksushi: that's it?
22:58  chatzilla: aah, that works. thanks

23:05  Radiant: hey guys
23:05 --- karstensrage is now known as Guest4265
23:06  Radiant: i'm making a game ratings website and i have a dilemma if i should use a table or  a list
23:06  oksushi: kiqyou_vf: use background instead of list-style-image
23:06  Radiant: currently i'm making a game profile page, it should have info about the game like Publisher: blablabla; Title: blablabla
23:07  Radiant: so should i use tables for it? i'd say it's tabular data
23:07  kiqyou_vf: oksushi: ahh, ok.
23:07  oksushi: Radiant: then yes
23:07  oksushi: if it is a matrix of information
23:08  oksushi: where there is an intrinsic relationship between the rows and columns
23:08  Radiant: yeah
23:10  kiqyou_vf: oksushi: that was it. thanks for your help. this is easier to manipulate this way too.
23:10  Radiant: it would be something like game detauls in the sidebar on this site: http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/114/1144268p1.html
23:10  Radiant: details*
23:12  doriad__: if two divs are display: inline-block and position: relative, shouldn't they appear side by side? http://ewh.ieee.org/r1/schenectady/New/
23:12  oksushi: they do not need 'position: relative'
23:12  doriad__: the 'sidebar' and 'maincontent' have those properties, but the sidebar pushes the main content down
23:12  doriad__: I tried it without that first
23:12  doriad__: it didn't change anything
23:13  oksushi: width = width + padding + border
23:13  oksushi: you have not given the columns enough space to appear (they are too wide)
23:13  chrislabeard: So if you have a absolute position element like a header and you have a wrapper with floated elements inside it how can you make the wrapper expand to all the floated elements without using overflow:hidden.
23:14  oksushi: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/ <-- chrislabeard
23:14  chrislabeard: it works with overflow:hidden but it cuts off my absolute positioned div
23:14  oksushi: there is no way to get the absolutely positioned things to affect the parent
23:14  oksushi: you have to give the parent an explicit height/width
23:14  oksushi: that's the nature of being removed from the document flow
23:15  doriad__: hm I changed maincontent to have min-width: 200px, which should give it plenty of space
23:15  oksushi: it still has a width
23:16  doriad__: where is it getting the width from?
23:18  doriad__: the only property is id=maincontent
23:19  doriad__: and maincontent only appears in one section in the css
23:19  doriad__: and doesn't talk about width in any of the other properties
23:28  doriad__: oksushi - any hints?

23:49  doriad__: crackgy: this is extremely annoying and hard
23:49  oksushi: crackguy: a) you need a doctype
