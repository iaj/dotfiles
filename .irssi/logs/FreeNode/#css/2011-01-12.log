00:08  benallard: oksushi: I've got it outside of its parent with float and margin, but if I add autoflow, it puts scrollbars, ... any idea how to prevent that ?
00:08  oksushi: autoflow?
00:08  oksushi: you mean overflow?
00:09  oksushi: overflow: auto; will make scrollbars if there is overflow. Change to 'overflow: visible;'
00:13  benallard: yeah, overflow auto
00:16  dravekx: whats the keyboard shortcut for the keyboard shortcut?
00:16  temhawk: it's keyboard shortcut
00:16  benallard: doesn't looks like overflow visible extends the parent to the size of the child ...
00:18  oksushi: benallard: no, it won't. You need to contain the floats using http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
00:18  benallard: oksushi: never mind, I've got a solution with an empty div clear:right at the end of the other one ...
00:18  oksushi: benallard: NO!
00:18  oksushi: do not do that
00:18  oksushi: read the url :)
00:19  jgornick: what's the webkit property that say when i specify width (css), it applies the width to the content width and doesn't look at the content + padding?
00:20  phantomcircuit: So I have an input[type=text], the background of the input is a repeat-x image, however the left and right are custom images that should be flush with the input, but they're not
00:20  oksushi: jgornick: box-sizing
00:20  jgornick: oksushi, box-sizing: content-box right
00:20  oksushi: jgornick: pretty sure, from memory
00:20  jgornick: double checking....
00:20  oksushi: -webkit-box-sizing in webkit perhaps
00:21  oksushi: -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
00:21  sanduz2: do you guys have any examples or cheat sheets? i know how to work with css but when i stop for a long time its hard to remember stuff about it

00:21  sanduz2: thanks
00:24  benallard: oksushi: Thanks a lot ! that was exactly the information I was looking for !
00:24  oksushi: np
00:25  jgornick: oksushi, too bad i can't apply that apparently to td's :(
00:25  jgornick: chrome doesn't respect content-box
00:25  oksushi: what on earth are you doing with a table?
00:26  jgornick: oksushi, trying to create a fixed header table
00:26  oksushi: jgornick: http://www.imaputz.com/cssStuff/bigFourVersion.html
00:27  jgornick: oksushi, i don't want to specify every single table cells width and have to match it up perfectly :)  i'm looking for a psudo fluid option
00:27  jgornick: i'm very close too
00:27  jgornick: it's minimal css + minimal js
00:27  ronghail: ooh I need that
00:28  jgornick: so what i'm trying to do right now is take my first rows column widths and apply those to the column width of the header
00:28  sanduz2: whats a good way to just have one column centered on the screen with a fixed width but a hieght that always spans maximum?
00:28  jgornick: since i've got my markup to include two tables
00:28  sanduz2: i also add a different color to the body so it looks like theres 3 columns
00:28  jgornick: in webkit, it doesn't like it when you put a <div> as a child of a table
00:29  Tempus2: unless you change the type of the div to something else than default, it is not legal markup jgornick
00:30  jgornick: Tempus2, exactly..
00:30  jgornick: i'll show my markup in a second here
00:30  Tempus2: <div> is not allowed inside td as far as I know
00:30  oksushi: sanduz2: http://www.pud.ca/misc/testcase/fullheight.html
00:31  sanduz2: thank you oksushi
00:33  sanduz2: oksushi,  thats a technique ive never seen before. (auto !important; and height: 100%;) does that work on css 2 and all browsers?
00:34  jgornick: Tempus2, in order to scroll the tbody, you need to wrap it somehow in a block elements with a height specified and overflow to auto
00:34  oksushi: yes - that is a trick to get IE6 to work
00:34  Tempus2: !important doesn't really have that intention though
00:34  sanduz2: i see thank you
00:35  jgornick: you can't simply apply that to the tbody since it screws up the display: table-* for table elements and you can't wrap a tbody in a table with div because div is an illegal element as a child in table
00:35  jgornick: Tempus2, so, i'm heading down another apporach to see if this will work
00:35  oksushi: ie6 sees 'height: 100%' everything else sees 'height: auto'
00:36  ronghail: this is my second day with css and I already tried the div in the table thing.  heh
00:36  Tempus2: You shouldn't use the table format of CSS and expect it to display like you want in IE heh
00:36  Tempus2: IE doesn't know the table formats
00:37  Tempus2: ANyway, can you use <span> elements or do the elements need to be block?
00:37  switch: has anyone ever tried the 960 grid system for css
00:37  dravekx: yeah, it sucks donkey balls.
00:38  jgornick: Tempus2, it needs to be a block to allow overflow: scroll
00:38  Tempus2: hum, that's funny, I just read an article about that heh
00:41  dravekx: switch, if you want to impress redneck bob and his failure to upgrade, 960 is for you.
00:42  Tempus2: If you need donkey-balls sucked, it would be perfect I assume?
00:43  welander: what framework would u recommend instead of 960?
00:44  welander: or grid system
00:45  dravekx: i recommend not using one.
00:45  lukus: what do you want to achieve welander ?
00:48  switch: i never got how you could use a framework for css
00:48  switch: may as well install joomla
00:49  jgornick: Tempus2, https://gist.github.com/775405
00:50  switch: hahaha github i love that
00:50  Tempus2: jgornick, you should use th in <thead>
00:50  Tempus2: <th>header</th>
00:50  jgornick: ok, was unsure about that
00:51  jgornick: because since it's already in a thead, it's obvious that the cells are header cells
00:51  Tempus2: also <th> if the first column of your table is descriptive
00:51  jgornick: Tempus2, what do you mean?
00:52  Tempus2: <th></td> are the same, it just enables you to easily have a different style on your header
00:52  Tempus2: a table has 2 dimensions
00:52  jgornick: <thead><tr><td></td></tr></thead>  ... i think style 'thead td' as the selector... same diff right?
00:53  jgornick: s/think/then
00:53  Tempus2: Well I guess :)
00:53  Tempus2: th is intended for table headers though
00:53  Tempus2: makes the font bold by default in most browsers
00:53  Tempus2: But it might make a headache in webkit
00:53  Tempus2: Depending on your table-style
00:54  Tempus2: But look at the source of this table: http://bcreativewilde.com/events.php
00:54  Tempus2: It has headers in both dimensions

03:06  Tempus2: I'd use left-margin rather, doing negative padding doesn't make sense
03:06  Tempus2: margin-left*
03:06  njbair: hmm doesn't work
03:07  Tempus2: margin?
03:07  njbair: no, background image
03:07  richardwhiuk: you can have a background image on a li
03:07  njbair: I don't know where it's rendering the image, but 'top left no-repeat' shows nothing
03:07  Tempus2: background: url("my.img") no-repeat;
03:07  njbair: right, that shows nothing
03:08  njbair: but take away no-repeat and i have a tiled bullet background
03:08  richardwhiuk: paste?
03:08  kappaluppa1: do you still optimize sites for IE7? meaning, do you consider it important still?
03:08  Tempus2: yes, paste your code
03:08  richardwhiuk: kappaluppa1: yes
03:08  richardwhiuk: kappaluppa1: but optimise does not mean obtain equal rendering
03:08  Tempus2: Depends on what you mean optimize
03:08  Tempus2: As for cosmetics, I don't give a rats ass about IE7
03:09  kappaluppa1: well, make sure the site looks as close to design as possible in ie7
03:09  kappaluppa1: do you feel ie7 has gone the way of ie6?
03:09  richardwhiuk: test yes, ensure basic functionality, yes
03:09  richardwhiuk: the way of ie 6?
03:09  njbair: http://pastebin.com/wS2QE7ys
03:10  Tempus2: njbair: use background
03:10  Tempus2: not background-image
03:10  njbair: *duh*
03:10  kappaluppa1: as in ie6 being pretty much a thing of the past, not to be considered
03:10  Tempus2: background-image is only the url to the background
03:11  richardwhiuk: njbair: either background or background-image and background-repeat and background-position
03:11 --- bananasontoast is now known as b[a]nanasontoast
03:12  richardwhiuk: realisticaly, IE 6 is more important than Safari, and IE 7 is more important than Chrome.
03:12  njbair: thx, i should know better
03:13  Tempus2: richardwhiuk, that wouldn't be entirely true
03:14  Tempus2: Even if the numbers of users might be higher, the users of chrome and Safari are much more confident on web than a user that still runs IE6 and shouldn't have any expectations of a support intact
03:15  Kunda: Tempus, when u say, 'make the image an image' i get confused, is it not an image ?
03:15  Tempus2: I didn't look at the source, just make the image float:left then
03:15  richardwhiuk: Tempus2: however a user of Chrome or Safari is also more likely to be willing to accept pages which don't look the best on their browser, while IE 6 hasn't got a choice about browser as it's probably corporate
03:16  Tempus2: And you shouldn't let bad choices go infront of good ones
03:16  richardwhiuk: really should be talking rendering engines I suppose and lump Safari and Chrome in one basket though.
03:17  Tempus2: Well yes
03:17  Tempus2: don't think they run the same javascript though
03:18  Tempus2: At least I read an article that iPad, iPod and iPhone wouldn't get a Mozilla browser from Mozilla.org because they had to implement Apples own javascript engine

03:20  mdmkolbe: I have a table with a header and a body.  Everything except the body cells in one particular column needs to be left aligned, but that one column needs to be right aligned (and only the body cells, not the head cells).  Is there a way to specify this once at the start of the table rather than specifying this on every <td> in that column?
03:22  Tempus2: class="left_align" and class="right_aligned"
03:22  Tempus2: Is this table generated by a server-side script?
03:22  mdmkolbe: Tempus2: and then put the class on each <td> in the column?
03:24  mdmkolbe: Tempus2: Yes, it is generated by a server-side script, so it isn't like a human has to edit every <td>, but at the same time, it makes the script hackish to include the extra code to flag one exception
03:24  mdmkolbe: Tempus2: it would be better if after the header of the table is printed, then all cells get treated the same way
03:24  richardwhiuk: Tempus2: Well Mozilla runs Gecko and Safari and Chrome both run WebKit, but each one uses a different Javscript implementation
03:25  richardwhiuk: but apart from speed of JS, Safari and Chrome are pretty indistinguishable.
03:27  Tempus2: I don't know what's up with Safari, but everytime I fire it up it sounds like it's indexing my harddrives, untill I close it again

05:02  JoeNeedsHelp: i also had a quick question about the p element
05:03  JoeNeedsHelp: you only use that if it's clearly a paragraph?
05:03  JoeNeedsHelp: not for any sentence right?
05:03  oksushi: a sentence can be a paragraph
05:03  AMcBain: CSS isn't after gradeschool "paragraphs must be at least 5 sentences long" :P
05:03  JoeNeedsHelp: right, but if it's not meant to be expressed as one, would you still use it?
05:04  AMcBain: no. think about what you asked, and you could probably answer that yourself.
05:04  oksushi: JoeNeedsHelp: you just answered your own question
05:05  JoeNeedsHelp: well the reason i asked is because i was looking at many site's source and saw a lot of p tags everywhere in places that weren't clearly paragraphs
05:05  JoeNeedsHelp: so i was thinking maybe i have it wrong

06:42  kramazeek: Anyone know of a way to use 100% of  layout width while setting columns in percent?
06:43  oksushi: sure, use percents for width
06:43  kramazeek: lol..right, but using a total of 100% will cause columns to wrap in some browsers.
06:45  atmos4: hey, someone know of a prob in IE8, where IE8 handles a div like a float, although it isn't floated?
06:46  kramazeek: atmos, have you changed the display property?
06:48  atmos4: it'S display: block
06:49  atmos4: in sacfari and firefox it's fine, in IE8 my #content div drops below the #navihgation div which is floated left
06:49  atmos4: also the enclosing #page div doesn't get expanded, like all elements are out of flow
06:51  kramazeek: Does the content div have clear: both or clear: left applied?
06:51  kramazeek: you want the content below the nav though right?
06:51  atmos4: no, it only has width and margin-left
06:53  kramazeek: Could I take a look?
06:53  atmos4: oh I see sth.
06:53  atmos4: missing > on one div tag
06:54  kramazeek: hehe..always validate. :o)
06:54  atmos4: yea, safari is a validator
06:54  atmos4: though it didn't complain about that
06:54  atmos4: it finds unclosed tags and stuff like that
06:54  atmos4: strange it didn't catch that
06:55  atmos4: safari has a validator I meant to say, or rather the webkit web inspector

07:01  kramazeek: I know its a noob question, but lets spitball. Why does the column wrap in some browsers? Webkit calculates percentage widths different from gecko?
07:01  ocf: hey all. I'm stuck on this. I have a wrapper div with a series of dynamically generated floated divs inside. I'm using cross-browser min-height to allow my page to flow freely below (content grows as needed), but where I'm stuck is applying the bg (rgba/filters to create a slightly opaque bg). I've tried applying it on every div in my page, and only when I apply it to my #page container does it
07:01  ocf: actually work
07:01 --- Channel #css was synced in 111 seconds
07:01  primepie: oksushi: http://groups.io/ I am working on the layout, and right now I have this in absolute ... the content in the blue/green will scroll within.. but I am wondering if there is a better way to lay them out other than absolute positioning.. I want them stretched out al lthe time
07:02  kramazeek: So a fluid, 100% width percentage layout is not possible without browser sniffing to handle differences in how some browsers handle percentage?
07:02  atmos4: ocf: rgba is not quite there yet, use png with alpha transparency
07:03  ocf: atmos4 - I'm mostly oncerned with applying the bg to the entire content area at this point
07:04  ocf: since I have a min-height set, that seems to be whats getting my bg
07:04  atmos4: try applying a border to the divs, where the bg doesn't work
07:04  NiLon: http://kilo.naurunappula.com/nn/1/506/917/s_selaimet_676393.jpg

07:19  primepie: oksushi: nm, I didn't notice the columns where pics

How can i create two columns with lets say 20 divs, but without the weird extra spacing that happens when you have to columns of divs and are simply floating them left? Here is an example of how they looked jacked up right now: http://tinyurl.com/37nmvww
10:07  treebeen: extra space in the middle?
10:08  treebeen: right now the space between the divs comes from "margin: 5px;"

10:21  sriley: made a guess, 99% of the time people ask about a border not working is due to people not containing floats

10:41  fr0stero: not in need of having a problem solved
10:42  oksushi: xotix: why not make the <a> display: block and give that the background?
10:44  MACscr: oksushi: it looks like crap still (my portfolio), http://tinyurl.com/37nmvww, but it at least works now.
10:44  oksushi: awesome
10:44  fr0stero: anyone used Javascript CSS Browser Selector

10:48  oksushi: xotix: look at the source code
10:48  oksushi: there is no <div>
10:49  xotix: yeah i've seend that rigth now. but that doesnt rly matter, does it?
10:49  mekwall: hmm, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/mcWnL/33/ <-- why is it that .ui-tagging-wrapper is 1px higher then the textarea inside it?
10:50  xotix: but thanks a lot i'll try that
10:50  mekwall: .ui-tagging-wrap*
10:50  oksushi: xotix: yes, because you cannot 'make a div clickable' like you asked
10:50  MACscr: oksushi: weird, that masonry plugin doesnt work as soon as i add rounded corners to the divs
10:51  oksushi: mekwall: is that supposed to show something?
10:51  oksushi: mekwall: using border-radius?
10:51  oksushi: umm, MACscr ^^
10:51  mekwall: oksushi: check the styles?
10:51  oksushi: mekwall: make a testcase that displays the issue

11:01  WierdAAR: MACscr, ahh. Ok . Thanks!
11:01  MACscr: and the navigation seems a bit crammed
11:02  WierdAAR: MACscr, Yeah.. Your right. I'll try to figure something out :)
11:03  MACscr: id add a contrast color somewhere as well
11:03  MACscr: if if your really going to be using images in the content area, adjust the margins
11:04  WierdAAR: MACscr, You mean have equal margins?
11:04  MACscr: that and the fact that there isnt any at the bottom of the image
11:05  MACscr: but the spacing between the right side of the page and the content just seems odd
11:05  MACscr: woops, right side of the page and the image and the image and the content
11:05  MACscr: that make sense? lol
11:05  WierdAAR: MACscr, yeah it does lol. Thanks for all the comments
11:06  MauriceJ: Oh I had the old site up.
11:06  oksushi: WierdAAR: justified text looks bad. Your text needs consistent leading and more space. Some good reads would be http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm and maybe webtypography.net/
11:06  MACscr: WierdAAR: what i would do is take off the width on the paragraphs, then set a margin line so on images. So like #content img { margin: 15px; }
11:07  oksushi: Also replace your lorem ipsum with actual content — it's rare that a page will have two similarly-sized paragraphs like that. What happens when there is more text? When there is less?
11:07  MACscr: to make it even look a bit more stylish, do: #content img { margin: 15px;background:#f7f7f7;padding:10px; }
11:09  MauriceJ: mekwall: This channel can be incredibly helpful when people aren't rude.  No reason to speak to oksushi the way you did.  We're volunteering our time and energy.  Take that into account in the future.

11:38  frostero: something along those lines
11:38  frostero: im testing out a lot of tech at the moment on that particular subject
11:38  frostero: trying to find the best possible solution
11:38  oksushi: frostero: good css is the best option.
11:38  frostero: no kidding
11:38  Drule: Hey pals.
11:38  Drule: I asked before but does anyone know of a good retail web hosting service, allowing the management of multiple accounts/domains/sites?
11:38  oksushi: you would rarely need browser-specific css
11:38  frostero: not true
11:38  oksushi: Drule: not a css question
11:39  frostero: there is always something
11:39  Drule: oksushi: Does it matter that much?
11:39  oksushi: Drule: it matters A LOT
11:39  frostero: i just want to figure out a final solution
11:39  Drule: How so
11:39  frostero: tired of multiple style sheets, tired of of conditional comments etc
11:40  oksushi: Drule: go ask in an appropriate channel. IRC is all about context. Don't ask about plumbing in #dentistry.
11:40  Drule: I don't see anything weird about asking people who work with web about their web hosting preferences.
11:41  oksushi: frostero: there is no 'final solution'. What you may like to check out is http://www.modernizr.com/ (which is a nifty browser capabilities checker tool) and http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/
11:41  oksushi: Drule: then go ask them in a channel about that topic
11:41  oksushi: #web might be a good option
11:42  frostero: oksushi: have you seen http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/
11:42  oksushi: yes of course
11:43  oksushi: but if you need to select each 'browser' in your css, you are Doing It Wrong
11:43  frostero: not each neccessarily
11:43  Drule: Sure, in the meantime you might want to check out #incessant-irc-guideline-nazism.
11:43  oksushi: Drule: touché!
11:43  frostero: just a few
11:43  oksushi: you showed me
11:44  oksushi: frostero: such as?
11:44  frostero: last site i developed has very slight differences between 3 versions of IE
11:44  frostero: not a whole lot to fix
11:44  oksushi: frostero: you don't need js for that. See the second link I gave you
11:46  frostero: quite interesting, wonder how i managed to miss that...
11:47  frostero: ok, i have seen this just implented slightly different
11:47  frostero: implemented even
11:48  Lazylegs: I've been using * + html and * html hacks for IE6 and 7 lately (hardly ever the IE6)
11:49  frostero: are you validating your work?
11:49  Lazylegs: Those validate
11:50  frostero: i wonder if this debate will ever truly be resolved
11:50  frostero: anyone have a clue why its not core css?
11:51  Lazylegs: Browser specific selectors?
11:51  frostero: yea
11:51  Lazylegs: Mayby due to final goal that all browsers would work the same.. bit of utopia :)
11:51  frostero: naw
11:51  newbie-kids: Hello.I need div autor box to be in line with div posts here is the css http://wordpress.pastebin.com/rmAkjAF9 and here is the blog http://bit.ly/e5hy3w  .And here is a screenshot in case u dont understand what i want.Please help.Thx in advanced http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/9746/capturb.png
11:52  Lazylegs: And also don't believe that -webkit and -moz crap actually helps it at all
11:52  frostero: useragent isnt changing anytime soon
11:52  frostero: if they implemented it right
11:52  frostero: as part of core css
11:53  frostero: that would be beautiful
11:53  frostero: im really surprised it isnt now that were on css3
11:54  frostero: i imagine it would only be a few lines of code added to a browser
11:54  frostero: couldnt be that difficult
11:54  newbie-kids: frostero who are you talking?:))
11:55  frostero: thats not a question noobs...
11:55  frostero: if your asking who im talking to...
11:55  newbie-kids: yes :P
11:55  frostero: well then im talking to anyone, i am interested in getting input on the subject
11:56  frostero: im pondering even working on an open source browser and making my own implementation of it
11:56  frostero: maybe some other peeps might get in on it
11:56  newbie-kids: seems you talk much :))) Smyle man ...and help me with my problem and then burn your brain again with your problem :P please
11:57  Lazylegs: I see your point, never fun to do hacks for mozilla or webkit browsers, but hardly ever need to
11:57  frostero: how can you tell someone they talk to much and then ask them for help
11:57  frostero: opera is always givin me css issues, so does ie for that matter
11:57  WierdAAR: I ḱnow this is technically not a CSS question, but I figured you would know the answer. How do I make me site show language specific characters like "ø,æ,å" and not "Ã¸l" or "Ã¥" ?
11:58  frostero: with code
11:59  WierdAAR: frostero, what code?
11:59  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html
11:59  WierdAAR: Lazylegs, Thanks!
12:01  frostero: newbie-kids: are you running firefox/firebug?
12:01  frostero: or ie/developer tools?
12:02  sriley: WierdAAR: save the file as utf8
12:02  newbie-kids: frostero firebug
12:02  WierdAAR: sriley, I don't understand?
12:02  ah_123: just wondering, when making a website, do you check in the mozilla firefox and IE6 and IE7? Cause I can't get my site to look same in firefox and IE.
12:03  MACscr: sriley: do you know how to specify background-size in shorthand? I cant seem to get it to work
12:03  ah_123: and in IE8...
12:03  MACscr: 	-moz-background:#e0f4ff url('/images/bg_02.png') 100% 100% no-repeat;
12:03  MACscr: doesnt seem to stretch at all
12:04  sriley: utf8 includes all those characters so no need for the entities, you need to save it as utf8 though check your text editor, also make sure youre sending the file as utf8 either via meta charset or header
12:04  newbie-kids: frostero : u help me?:)
12:05  sriley: bth not reallt looked at background size as it wont work in most browsers
12:05  WierdAAR: sriley, Ok, I got it. Thanks!
12:07  MACscr: sriley: it works in all browsers besides IE, which can be fixed with css3pie, but i cant figure out how to specify it with in shortcode, which i need to do
12:08  sriley: im not a fan of things like css3pie, tend to cause performance and maintenance issues
12:08  MACscr: yeah, im learning that i guess. I might just have to give up on this design idea
12:10  Lazylegs: MACscr, learn to google but here you have it. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#background
12:10  MACscr: Lazylegs: lol, of course i have been there. Doesnt work for me
12:11  Sanshi: ah_123: yes always checking in IE , FF, Safari and chrome
12:11  Lazylegs: MACscr, when I need reference, I use search terms like: css2 background w3c or css3 background w3c
12:12  ah_123: Sanshi: is there anyway to make sure the site stays consistent, especially while using cms
12:12  MACscr: im not looking or a referrence. I have already checked them. Was just looking to see if someone else had used it in order to help me troubleshoot it. I havent found anyone the couple times that i have brought it up that have used it
12:12  _newbie_: Hi guys, I have a div with a set width. I fill it with a few words of text which comes from a database. The problem is the words can be all different lengths and because the div is a set width sometimes the text can break out of the box. Is it possible to shrink the text using css so that it is always within the boundries of the div. Kind of like a %
12:14  frostero: word wrap
12:14  frostero: werd
12:14  Sanshi: ah_123: its easy to get it 90% look the same. Using easy tags and checking if they work in IE6 or if there are any hacks. If IE6 will support, all others will also (mostly). The rest 10% is just trying and sometimes (especially when using IE6) working with some hacks or workarounds
12:15  Lazylegs: MACscr, thats is mostly due to the browser support of it. Like me, doing sites to work with > IE7 and do not like to use js for fixing issues
12:17  ah_123: Sanshi: cause I noticed for example if you do something like <h2>title</h2>, it looks fine in firefox, but not in IE compatibility mode. h2 tags has a 10px margin predefined. And in IE, it totally ignores that. Not sure if I am not doing something right.
12:20  Sanshi: ah_123: well if you want a tag to look the same you have to override it yourself. The browsers take their own standards and they are sometimes the same and sometimes a bit different. So just override it with your own definition.
12:53  mathi: hi
12:53  mathi: what is the way to make columns with different widths ? the table has no fixed width
12:57  dravekx: ... he said "table"
12:58 --- Cain` is now known as Cain
12:59  jedinix: oh hai
12:59  mathi: dravekx, yep, what's the problem ?
12:59  jedinix: is there a selector for class AND id in one?
12:59  jedinix: i've never actually needed this.. ever.. so i'm probably fucking doing it wrong.. i have been up since last friday
13:00  jedinix: but i'm looking to do basically #divId.class1 or #divId.class2
13:00  HappyPelican: unnecessary
13:01  HappyPelican: Every ID is unique, so you will never need #foo.bar
13:01  jedinix: the pita is i need the class to only apply to the element with id x
13:01  HappyPelican: Have you tried #foo.bar?
13:01  jedinix: well, it is if i want to apply a class to a whole set of elements, and each is different
13:01  jedinix: yeah.. that doesn't work
13:03  jedinix: erm, disregard
13:03  jedinix: it was an error in my jQuery code.
13:04  jedinix: #foo.bar does work.
13:04  jedinix: lol
13:04  jedinix: i just wanted a modifier that i could apply to a certain page type
13:04  jedinix: keep styling the same for a set of elements site-wide, and add a modifier class on certain pages
13:29  chatzilla: hi
13:29  chatzilla: i am doing a little webdesign from time to time. is it still necessary to support internet explorer 6? how many people are still using it?
13:30  Nicke\: chatzilla: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
13:32  chatzilla: thx
13:36  denysonique: chatzilla: google is dropping support for it in march
13:37  denysonique: Do you know that you can actually save changes made in Firebug?
13:37  tom__: Hello, could anyone explain how some sites are adopting new fonts with HTML rendering and support for ie6 such as: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ ?
13:42  ganeshjacharya: wanted to know accessibility problems with CSS based drop down menu
13:42  ganeshjacharya: when using mobile phones
13:44  Lazylegs: tom__, What you mean?
13:44  tom__: How are they doing this?
13:44  tom__: I realise sifr can be used
13:44  Lazylegs: by using @font-face
13:44  tom__: but it's a bit clunky
13:44  goleif: tom__ The support for custom fonts is just generally bad. Avoid it another year or two, is my suggestion...
13:45  Lazylegs: goleif, how come?
13:45  tom__: how does font-facee work? I've heard that google offer 8 fonts and there's also type-kit. Why can't we use our own servers to do whatever it needs to?
13:45  Lazylegs: tom__, fontsquirrel has everything you need from generator to fonts
13:45  goleif: Lazylegs: Well, when I've tried it out, it hasn't looked the same in two browsers, and I don't want to insert extra CSS for different browsers. It just shouldn't be necessary.
13:46  goleif: Lazylegs: And most of the time, it -doesn't- look good, because it looks all pixelated. Perhaps depending on the settings in Window, but still.
13:46  tom__: So what do you use as your solution? sifr? cufon?
13:47  goleif: (pixelated might be the wrong word. Corny, crass...)
13:47  Lazylegs: goleif, so what would be your recommendation?
13:47  ShawnRisk: I have 2 problems on my site, the contact info in the header goes too far down and 2 menu items on the tabs below the header go onto second page.  How do I fix this?  I am using FF.  http://indytaxservice.com/
13:47  Lazylegs: obviously anti-alias is an issue
13:48  goleif: Lazylegs: To use standard fonts...
13:48  tom__: goleif:  boring
13:48  goleif: tom__: Agreed.
13:48  goleif: But I prefer boring instead of shitty.
13:49  ganeshjacharya: http://www.pluginlab.com/accessibility.asp
13:49  ganeshjacharya: are these claims relevant?
13:51  goleif: ShawnRisk: I don't know about the menu, but the contact info thingy should just be a size-thingy, isn't it?
13:53  Lazylegs: ganeshjacharya, drop downs on hover as an example are seen against accessibility
13:53  ShawnRisk: goleif: width?
13:54  ganeshjacharya: Lazylegs: do you have any research that i can refer
13:54  ganeshjacharya: i was searching for one
13:54  ganeshjacharya: not getting it
13:54  ganeshjacharya: we have main menu and sub menu options to present
13:55  ganeshjacharya: wanted to look out for best examples
13:55  Lazylegs: just searching for it, thought that I had it in bookmarks
13:55  ganeshjacharya: ok
13:56  goleif: ShawnRisk: I haven't looked at your source code (I'm doing some work on my own :)  but if it doesn't fit the height...change the height
13:56  goleif: ShawnRisk: Or padding, or margin, or font size...
13:56  ShawnRisk: goleif: yes but every screen uses different sizes.  Should I have the same font and font size used?  As in Chrome if I just add a div margin-top:10px; in the space between title and email that solves things
13:57  goleif: ShawnRisk: I understand. But:
13:57  goleif: ShawnRisk: For text that belongs to the layout, it's not a crime to use static font sizes.
13:58  goleif: ShawnRisk: You always have to draw the line somewhere.
13:58  goleif: ShawnRisk: The "real" content, on the other hand, that doesn't depend on the height, should be in dynamic font sizes.
13:59  ShawnRisk: goleif: examples of code I should use?
14:00  goleif: ShawnRisk: Not necessary - Just use font-size: 12px;  for the layout, and font-size: 1em;  for the content
14:01  goleif: (For example.)
14:01  ShawnRisk: no font-family?
14:01  goleif: ShawnRisk: Well, of course. :D  You can use:   font: bold 10px arial;   for example.
14:02  goleif: ShawnRisk: It only depends on how you want it to look...
14:02  Lazylegs: ganeshjacharya, crap cant find it.. anyways, people who do not use mouse as an example hardly can hover over the items
14:02 --- bobo_b|afk is now known as bobo_b
14:02  ShawnRisk: goleif: I just want all the writing in the header
14:03  ShawnRisk: goleif: I get this now thanks
14:03  goleif: ShawnRisk: Well, try   font: 10px arial;  Then it surely should fit the header.
14:04  goleif: ShawnRisk: No problem. Nice looking site, btw. But you should use a sans-serif font in the menu tabs :)
14:04  ShawnRisk: ok thanks
14:05  Lazylegs: and about accessibility, relative font sizes should be used
14:16  robbit10: Hi everyone. I'm designing this website: http://www.hansgitaarles.nl/deshimadelft/ <-- But it looks bad in IE, and good in almost every other browser. Can somebody help me make this cross-compatible, please?

14:21  nvictor: didn't work
14:22  nvictor: should the parent container have a fixed height as well?
14:22  nvictor: width worked perfectly but the parent has a width set
14:27  robbit10: nvictor, Myx0x3: Do either of you have the answer to my question? (You seem to be the only ones active in here)
14:27  nvictor: robbit10: didn't see your question

14:28  Jackass4D: tell you its not easy...
14:28  robbit10: Things looking off in IE are: The menu, the content area sometimes stretches out but the background picture doesn't, and the box shadow doesn't show up
14:29  Jackass4D: heh, box shadow will never show up if css shadow
14:31  nvictor: robbit10: ie version?
14:31  Jackass4D: $10-15
14:31  nvictor: robbit10: well it's not well rendered in chrome either
14:31  robbit10: nvictor: it isn't? It renders fine here :S
14:31  robbit10: and i'm using Chromium (open-source version of Chrome)
14:32  nvictor: robbit10: well the menu overflows here
14:32  robbit10: nvictor: ah, yes. I've been wondering how to fix that. It overflows at lower resolutions. Would overflow: auto work?
14:32  iaj: lo hmm, can someone help me.. I can't find why the image on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=60&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=4&cHash=e34edead99f9e9464a4dcb4194234f9b is aligned higher than the p tag next to it?
14:33  nvictor: robbit10: i am not sure but setting a width would work
14:33  nvictor: robbit10: but i don't know for IE, i have given up on IE long time ago
14:34  Jackass4D: yes! nvictor
14:34  Jackass4D: you did the right thing
14:34  nvictor: not sure if it was
14:35  Jackass4D: yes it is
14:35  nvictor: but one thing is certain, things are moving fast into mobile and html5 direction
14:35  Jackass4D: i'm now only IE 8+
14:35  robbit10: I'd be happy if nobody would use IE anymore
14:35  robbit10: but sadly, the target audience for this website mostly uses IE

14:40  nikki`: dont you just love !important; ?
14:40  timing: all the files look correct in font viewers
14:41  timing: however my headers ( I use the font for h1, h2 etc ) don't look like the font
14:44  timing: Also, when I open the resources tab in chrome and I click on the font, it displays the alphabet in that font. But it just looks like times in the chrome debugger. Not like the sans-serif font I try to use
14:46  robbit10: Is there a CSS property to set the minimal height of something?
14:46  joeyaa: min-height
14:46  timing: min-height

15:35  jedimind: robbit10, you solve it by having less menu items? or you modify your layout so that the menu is not at the top, but in a column on the left/right of the page instead
15:39  robbit10: jedimind: Thanks. I decided to make the font size smaller, and it kinda solved it. But only for those whom have high resolutions.
15:40  nikki`: robbit whats the problem
15:40  Anomie2: I'm positioning a image with CSS. when I do this - it appears to over-write my hyperlink? Can anyone tell me why? http://civvystreetmagazine.co.uk
15:40  Anomie2: html code: <div id="flash"><a href="http://www.pubstolet.com/forces"><img src="http://civvystreetmagazine.co.uk/civvybanner1.gif"></a>  </center></div>
15:40  Anomie2: css: #flash 	 {float:right; margin-top:-25px;}
15:40  Anomie2: link appears as http://civvystreetmagazine.co.uk instead of pubstolet.com/forces on the page
15:40  nikki`: use z-index
15:41  nikki`: put the hyperlink on a higher z-index
15:41  nikki`: so for example img { z-index:1; }
15:41  nikki`: a { z-index:2; }
15:42  nikki`: also why are you using </center>?
15:42  nikki`: you have no start tag to that
15:43  Anomie2: just a bit of junk code left in - removed
15:43  robbit10: nikki`: The menu at http://www.hansgitaarles.nl/deshimadelft only looks good at higher resolutions. When at a lower resolution, the menu wraps to a newline when it runs out of space.
15:43  Anomie2: I have no idea what z-index is
15:43  nikki`: Anomie2: google it
15:43  nikki`: robbit10: this page has no set width
15:44  nikki`: nor does the ul so yes it will do
15:44  Anomie2: I did
15:44  robbit10: nikki`: it does
15:44  robbit10: nikki`: the CSS is external
15:44  nikki`: i know but when you minimise it into a small window
15:44  nikki`: it wraps
15:44  nikki`: why not give the page container a width?
15:44  nikki`: and margin:0 auto;
15:44  nikki`: Anomie2: http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pos_z-index.asp
15:44  robbit10: nikki`: the page container is #menuandcontent, and it does have a width
15:45  robbit10: nikki`: http://www.hansgitaarles.nl/deshimadelft/backend/styles/deshima.css
15:45  nikki`: width:90%;
15:45  nikki`: not good enough.
15:45  nikki`: width:960px;
15:45  nikki`: would make more sense to me
15:46  Derppy: Could someone assist me a little with this: http://jsfiddle.net/GSC8b/ ? I'd want the container and the other columns to expand with the longest column (Drag multiple items to one column to see the problem).
15:46  Anomie2: So the z-index would be putting the link behind the image?
15:46  Anomie2: Why is the css cancelling out my link in the first place?
15:46  Derppy: Since this dashboard-project is for a really few people with latest chrome/ff/safari, CSS3 trickery is fine.
15:47  robbit10: nikki`: i set it to 1280, but that only works for people with 1280x1024, otherwise the entire page would scroll.
15:47  robbit10: nikki`: at least, I think that would happen
15:48  nikki`: no...
15:49  nikki`: standard web width is 960px
15:49  nikki`: meaning you will then cater for the lowest resoultions, ( 860 x..
15:49  ZombieLoffe: uhh. What?
15:49  nikki`: http://webdesign.about.com/od/webdesign/a/aa080904.htm
15:49  nikki`: im talking to robbit10
15:49  ZombieLoffe: There's no such thing as "standard web width"... a lot of people choose 960px because it's easily divisible and works for people running 1024x768
15:50  nikki`: it is standard,,... look at any website
15:50  nikki`: and it will be around 960px wide
15:50  nikki`: lets now take ebay.com as an example
15:50  ZombieLoffe: It's nost standardised, therefore it's not standard.
15:50  robbit10: nikki`: thanks
15:50  ZombieLoffe: It's COMMON, not "standard".
15:50  nikki`: it is :)
15:50  nikki`: i have been working within web companies for 7 years...
15:50  ZombieLoffe: Then you should know what a standard means.
15:50  nikki`: we use 960/980 etc as a standard
15:51  nikki`: no your just being pedantic.
15:51  HappyPelican1: you mean "you're"
15:51  ZombieLoffe: I'm being specific :P
15:51  MauriceJ: nikki`: ZombieLoffe is being correct.
15:51  nikki`: ebay is 990px
15:51  HappyPelican1: so?
15:52  nikki`: ebuyer.com is 980px
15:52  nikki`: well it tells you something,... 99% of websites generally are about this width
15:52  HappyPelican1: no, that is not what ebay's width tells you
15:52  nikki`: so robbit10 should set a width
15:52  nikki`: yes it is i just firebugged it
15:52  MauriceJ: nikki`: You're pointing out something that is moot, saying that something is 'true by consensus'.  You're not actually proving anything.
15:52  HappyPelican1: no
15:52  HappyPelican1: ebay's width does not tell you that 99% of websites generally are about that width
15:53  nikki`: im not trying to proove anything, merely to help someone who has a width of 90%
15:53  HappyPelican1: what's wrong with 90%?
15:53  nikki`: he is complainign about his menu changing when you make the window smaller...
15:53  nikki`: nothing is WRONG with it, however if he set a width
15:53  nikki`: he wouldnt have that problem
15:53  nikki`: :P
15:53  nikki`: most websites have a container, with a width
15:53  nikki`: he doesnt.
15:54  nikki`: point is... do it!
15:54  HappyPelican1: do it, because other websites do it?
15:54  robbit10: nikki`: i've set it to 960
15:54  nikki`: yes
15:54  ZombieLoffe: "most websites" is dubious. [citation needed].
15:54  HappyPelican1: and you claim to have been a web developer for 7 years
15:54  nikki`: px?
15:54  HappyPelican1: sheesh
15:54  nikki`: does it fix your problem
15:54  robbit10: nikki`: yes
15:54  robbit10: nikki`: no.. not completely
15:54  robbit10: nikki`: The menu still wraps lines, but at least it looks the same on every resolution
15:54  HappyPelican1: robbit10: do you want a fixed width of 980px (or whatever) for your website?
15:54  nikki`: robbit10: try 990px
15:55  robbit10: HappyPelican1: I want my menu to be scrollable and not wrap lines. It's a horizontal CSS menu.
15:55  Derppy: To make my last question a bit more simple: Is it possible to have floated lists, that expand their container and stay as tall as the longest list / the container? http://jsfiddle.net/GSC8b/
15:55  HappyPelican1: heh
15:55  robbit10: HappyPelican1: http://www.hansgitaarles.nl/deshimadelft
15:55  random_buddha: hey I have created this code: http://www.pasteit4me.com/2109002 however the content does not center
15:56  nikki`: random: use the rule margin:0 auto;
15:56  nikki`: on the container you want to center
15:57  nikki`: oh and your wrapper has no . before it on your css
15:57  nikki`: its a class
15:57  nikki`: wrapper { widt....
15:57  nikki`: should be .wrapper { widt...
15:58  Derppy: I'd prefer a cross-browser solution, but CSS3 could do if it would simplify it by great amount.
15:59  nikki`: use jquery
15:59  robbit10: i'll be back later. Gotta do something. Thanks for the help :)
15:59  random_buddha: thanks nikki` :)
16:00  nikki`: random_buddha: fixed?
16:01  andriijas: is there anyway to achieve this with css?  "    f<br>o<br>o<br>b<br>a<br>r "
16:02  nikki`: lol yes
16:02  Derppy: nikki`: So it's not possible with CSS? The whole thing requires heavy javascript anyway, but I'd like to keep it clean and this kind of feels like something CSS should take care of.
16:02  nikki`: spans floated left
16:02  nikki`: <span>f</span><span>o</span>....
16:02  nikki`: span { float:left;  }
16:02  andriijas: kk
16:03  sriley: it needs to be like that or rotated ok? you can rotate text in all browsers
16:03  andriijas: nikki`: but is that really more clean to have a span per letter than br?
16:03  nikki`: debatable...
16:03 --- Curt` is now known as curt`off
16:03  nikki`: id prefer just the <br />
16:03  sriley: having a span per letter is really rather ugly
16:03  andriijas: i dont want to rotate the text, i think. i could try though.
16:03  nikki`: but i guess it doesnt matter too much?
16:03  nikki`: neither is wrong
16:05  andriijas: nikki`: isnt it easier to read to to down text than rotated?
16:05  nikki`: i dont think vertical text in css is cross browser
16:06  nikki`: so just use the <br /> or span.. either is fine really
16:06  nikki`: just a bit manual
16:06  andriijas: there is rotate css3 stuff in webkit hehe
16:06  andriijas: yeah
16:06  nikki`: yes but not crossbrowser
16:06  nikki`: :P
16:06  sriley: there is rotate in all browsers
16:06  nikki`: ah
16:06  nikki`: do that then
16:06  Derppy: Wouldn't it work if you just put the text like "f o o b a r" and put a very little width to the container. So it would force it on multiple lines
16:06  sriley: even ie5.5 (though limited to 90, 180, 270)
16:07  nikki`: yes Derppy which is the same as using spans
16:07  sriley: Derppy: yes, though worse for accessibility
16:07  sriley: would be spelt instead of read in a screen reader
16:08  nikki`: sriley: blind people dont matter :P
16:08  nikki`: joking lol
16:08  andriijas: :P
16:08  Derppy: True, but would be cleaner html. But isn't there some property that forces a cut even in the middle of words? So you could do the same with "Foobar"
16:09  nikki`: Derppy: save yourself a headache and time, use <br />
16:09  nikki`: its 'legal'
16:09  andriijas: :)
16:09  nikki`: lol#
16:09  andriijas: multipass: leeloo dallas multipass
16:10  multipass: autowash
16:10  MauriceJ: Using <br> is lame.
16:10  stickDeath: loool
16:11  stickDeath: love leeloo
16:11  MauriceJ: It's also using HTML as presentation and that's more lame.
16:11  andriijas: MauriceJ: agreed but its fast and convinient in this case.
16:11  andriijas: MauriceJ: how would you do it then? spans?
16:11  nikki`: yeah i dont see how else your going to do it, and really thats what <br /> is for line down?
16:11  HappyPelican1: And is lazy, inaccessible and not semantic. And no nikki`, it is not what <br /> is for
16:12  nikki`: <br /> is a line break
16:12  nikki`: simple
16:12  MauriceJ: andriijas: There are three ways I can think of just now but I'm going to continue watching the misinformation that nikki` is doling out in here instead of suggesting anything at the moment.
16:12  andriijas: Saying <br> is lame is lame, we all know br is lame just state how you would do it instead.
16:13  speak: what if you later decide you want to change your sites _presenation_... you have to delete all those br's. lame
16:13  nikki`: HappyPelican1: what else do you use <br /> for? other than a line break.... dont tell me you dont know html aswell.
16:13  stickDeath: maybe he uses like margin-bottom: 20px
16:13  stickDeath: :P
16:14  andriijas: you guys are just rambling all the default semantic stuff which everyone allready is aware of. why is it so difficult to just state how you would solve the problems? freaking troll behavior.
16:14  nikki`: yeah well I did...
16:14  MauriceJ: andriijas: The only troll behaviour I see in here is the misinformation being doled out.
16:14  nikki`: <HappyPelican1> And is lazy, inaccessible and not semantic. And no nikki`, it is not what <br /> is for (comments like that are retarded)
16:14  stickDeath: what do you use instead <br />
16:14  nikki`: <br /> is clearly a line break... but becuase i said, its not
16:14  andriijas: speak: did you even read the use case here or did you just jump in the ring of fire because you saw someone mention <br>?
16:15  MauriceJ: andriijas: HappyPelican1 is one of the most helpful people in here so stop with the silly 'troll' accusations.
16:15  nikki`: HappyPelican1 is retarded.
16:15  andriijas: MauriceJ: well he was not helping in this matter. just jumped in to the ring of fire.
16:15  andriijas: this all started as a nice discussion until someone saw <br> and had to light the torch.
16:16  andriijas: :P
16:16  stickDeath: lol
16:17  goleif: How do I create a margin on <hr> ? :S
16:17  goleif: seems impossible
16:19  Lazylegs: goleif, hr { margin: what every you want }
16:20  goleif: Lazylegs: Doesn't seem to work if you also use clear:both;
16:20  Lazylegs: goleif: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0w&raw
16:20  Lazylegs: lets see
16:21  HappyPelican1: nikki`, andriijas: How about something like http://www.webdevout.net/test?0v&raw
16:21  nikki`: not cross browser
16:21  HappyPelican1: Which browser doesn't it work in?
16:22  sriley: goleif: read up on containing floats
16:22  andriijas: HappyPelican1: yeah that works. but my question is, is it more difficult for users to read rotated text than top to bottom text?
16:22  andriijas: HappyPelican1: i mean what is most important, that ppl who can read can read it easy or that blind ppl get it spelled or read?
16:22  nikki`: compare it from FF to IE
16:22  nikki`: i dont think it will work in IE6
16:23  HappyPelican1: nikki`: try it http://www.webdevout.net/test?0y&raw
16:23  nikki`: you have browser specific rules?
16:24  HappyPelican1: nikki`: it works in IE 5.5 :)
16:24  nikki`: on firefox is displays in the top right, IE is displays in the bottom left... also you have browser specific rules
16:24  HappyPelican1: And it looks the same in FF (my original link just had the wrong rotation flag for IE)
16:24  nikki`: but ok, that kinda works i guess.. you get some cake.
16:24  HappyPelican1: Yeah, I fixed that in http://www.webdevout.net/test?0y&raw
16:25  HappyPelican1: From you? Gee, thank you
16:25  nikki`:  :)
16:25  sriley: tbh why have a hr anyway, use a border
16:25  andriijas: i dont give shit about ie5.5,  light your torches and grab your pitchforks but i dont give shit :P
16:25  nikki`: yeah
16:25  HappyPelican1: andriijas: as for your question on most readable, top down text is far less readable than rotated text, in my opinion
16:25  nikki`: why not doo width:100%; margin-right:1%;
16:25  andriijas: HappyPelican1: okay cool
16:25  nikki`: joking btw.
16:26  nikki`: before you greif me.
16:26  andriijas: HappyPelican1: for some reasons your nickname makes me think of panncakes.
16:26  andriijas: i want panncakes.
16:26  HappyPelican1: andriijas: feel free not to give a shit about <IE7 :)
16:26 --- HappyPelican1 is now known as HappyPelican
16:27  nikki`: so right we have just spent like 30mins abusing each over the use of the <br /> tag, sweet!
16:28  andriijas: fyi im rolling the rotate road.
16:28  tw2113: how many times did the word "semantic" come up?
16:28  MauriceJ: tw2113: Not enough.
16:28  HappyPelican: tw2113: one from me
16:28  tw2113: just checking
16:28  HappyPelican: :)
16:28  Lazylegs: How often "Separate content from presentation"?
16:28  HappyPelican: "lame" about 17 times
16:28  MauriceJ: I did point out something about presentation, though.
16:28  HappyPelican: Yep
16:28  HappyPelican: (lol @ the review of the discussion)
16:29  speak: Lazylegs guilty as charged
16:29  andriijas: nobody mentioned anal bleaching though.
16:29  tw2113: i won't deny using it from time to time
16:29  HappyPelican: I believe nikki` did
16:29  tw2113: just not very often, <p> gets used a bit more
16:29  MauriceJ: A badly done anal bleaching, in fact.
16:29  nikki`: i did what
16:33  andriijas: HappyPelican: the rotate didnt position  it where i wanted though
16:33  HappyPelican: :(
16:33  nikki`: play with the digits?
16:33  nikki`: untill it does, jeesh you want him to do that for you too :P
16:33  andriijas: nikki`: no
16:33  andriijas: its just that i dont use fixed width
16:34  andriijas: and i use position: fixed; right: 0;

16:36  andriijas: HappyPelican: any idea?
16:38  HappyPelican: andriijas: have a live link?
16:38  digitalfiz: hey guys i am having an issue does anyone know what would make a image in 1 td of a table effect the text in the other td's on that row? like they are below it but its nothing but empty space above them
16:39  digitalfiz: http://buyrims.net/products/ is the site im working on its a wordpress site and its a bit messy but i cant figure out why the image in 1 td is effecting the other tds ive even hardcoded valign="top" to see if it was that
16:39  CarlaM: Hi im trying to make my website look the same in IE8 as it does in Chrome or mozilla but i havent been successful.http://islandbytes.net/public/home
16:40  andriijas: HappyPelican: http://jsbin.com/eyimu4
16:41  CarlaM: digitalfiz: i unno whihch td your talking about
16:42  digitalfiz: the product listing
16:42  digitalfiz: see how the product image is at the top of the td but the product name and everything else is pushed way down
16:44  CarlaM: do you have a rowspan?
16:45  CarlaM: nvm
16:46  HappyPelican1: andriijas: and how do you want it to look?
16:46  CarlaM: the test inside the <td>, what happens when u make it smaller
16:46  andriijas: HappyPelican1: located right to the scroll bar
16:46  iaj: hmmmm any guide on how to create css styled buttons...?
16:47  digitalfiz: CarlaM, if i remove the image and but text in there its fine
16:47  digitalfiz: watch gimmie 1min
16:47  CarlaM: ur text is too big
16:47  andriijas: iaj: http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-gradient-buttons/
16:47  CarlaM: not the siz but the width
16:47  CarlaM: n plus u have padding on the left n right
16:48  digitalfiz: check it now i put a bunch of line breaks and tests
16:48 --- sriley_ is now known as sriley
16:48  CarlaM: i know
16:48  CarlaM: your test area...where u have description of you products etc
16:48  digitalfiz: i can remove all the text and put only "test" and it still ends up below the image
16:48  CarlaM: its a lil too big n there is padding on the left n right side of the <p>
16:49  digitalfiz: ok nothing but test in the td with the description and title
16:49  digitalfiz: i thought that too but now there is no way its to much text
16:50  HappyPelican1: andriijas: it's because of the width on #tab div {}
16:51  andriijas: HappyPelican1: yeah
16:51  andriijas: HappyPelican1: any work arround?
16:53  CarlaM: can i see what happens wen u add valign?
16:53  CarlaM: to the plain test
16:53  digitalfiz: CarlaM, if i take the image out and leave the images link with text its something with the img tag itself
16:54  digitalfiz: even if it do <a>TEST<br />TEST<br /></a> it aligns top but as soon as that img tag is put in it kicks it down
16:54  digitalfiz: i think some css in the wp theme is messing with the image
16:54  HappyPelican1: andriijas: you might look at playing with margins, (eg: margin-top: -50%) or removing the inner div
16:55  CarlaM: i think so too...
16:55  CarlaM: add !important
16:55  CarlaM: to the css line ud like it to do
16:55  iaj: andriijas: hmm thanks.. well.. - do you have a guide fo rsetting those up if I got a predefined button image... (eg use the edges and stuff of it)
16:55  CarlaM: ex... vertical-align:top !important;
16:56  nikki`: margin-top: -50%?
16:56  nikki`: that is the uggliest rule youve ever come out with
16:56  andriijas: iaj: nope
16:56  HappyPelican1: nikki`: do you understand why there is a gap?
16:56 * nikki` hands HappyPelican1 a cookie
16:56  nikki`: i hate %
16:56  digitalfiz: CarlaM, that did it :D
16:56  HappyPelican1: okay, you're officially a troll
16:57  HappyPelican1: and please don't PM me again
16:57  digitalfiz: CarlaM, tyvm
16:57  nikki`: lol
16:57  nikki`: no.
16:57  andriijas: seems like i need negative margin-right tough
16:57  HappyPelican1: andriijas: try it and see what happens :)
16:57  andriijas: calm down guys
16:57  CarlaM: no problem
16:57  andriijas: HappyPelican1: i am
16:57  nikki`: we are calm, i have cookies.
16:57  andriijas: HappyPelican1:     margin-right: -2.75%;
16:57  andriijas: feels very hackish though
16:58  CarlaM: now my question.... ie 8 screwing up my website http://islandbytes.net/public/home issues with drop shadow and border radius. Help please!
17:02  CarlaM: now my question.... ie 8 screwing up my website http://islandbytes.net/public/home issues with drop shadow and border radius. Help please!
17:03  ComradeHaz`: Hi all. The span tag, as discussed on http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp .... Is it just a principal rather than the word 'span' being in some way special. I mean, I just replaced the word span with foo and it still seems to work. Is this accepted practice?
17:03  Shadur: That sounds like a terrible idea even if it happens to work.
17:03  nikki`: lol
17:04  ComradeHaz`: Well, in that example I might use 'eyes' instead of span.
17:04  nikki`: ComradeHaz`: no that is not acceptable
17:04  moshee: CarlaM, how can you expect those to work in IE8?
17:04  ComradeHaz`: So " <p>My mother has <eyes class="blue">light blue</eyes> eyes.</p>"
17:05  nikki`: ComradeHaz: thats fine
17:05  nikki`: then blue {color:blue; } yay!
17:05  ComradeHaz`: Yeah.
17:05  ComradeHaz`: Did you think I meant something else?
17:05  nikki`: yes
17:06  ComradeHaz`: Ah, OK, cool. So that span is a principal, not a special tag?
17:06  nikki`: no its a class
17:06  nikki`: your simply relating what the class does in your code
17:06  nikki`: go get a coffee :P
17:06  ComradeHaz`: I have one!
17:06  nikki`: ah your all set then
17:07  ComradeHaz`: Haha, this is learning to code web pages day 2
17:07  ComradeHaz`: Day 1 went badly :D
17:07  ComradeHaz`: Day 2 is going the same way :D
17:07  nikki`: well your doing well for day 2 to be onto classes and spans etc...
17:08  ComradeHaz`: Got the CSS for dummies book
17:08  ComradeHaz`: following that as a framework
17:08  nikki`: i see
17:08  ComradeHaz`: He doesn't mention span, just the use of the principal as a class
17:09  ComradeHaz`: I think the book's a bit sh1t tbh
17:09  nikki`: well dont jump too far here, your simply styling a span however your putting in the class what it does... dont look into that too much concentrate on the use of divs and spans, and the difference between classes and ID`s etc
17:10  ComradeHaz`: o.O
17:10 * ComradeHaz` watches that whistle over his head, shrugs and carries on pretending everything's fine
17:14  random_buddha: hey, I am trying to center an element with this code: http://www.pasteit4me.com/2071004  however the element does not center
17:20  NickASloan: does position: absolute on an element make that element's siblings not contained by the parent?
17:20  moshee: it's positioned absolutely on the page unless its parent is positioned relatively
17:20  NickASloan: nevermind. I'm a fool.
17:21  NickASloan: moshee: it's parent is positioned relatively
17:21  NickASloan: but it should still contain children with position: static, right?
17:21  moshee: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/css-positioning-101/
17:21  moshee: read that if you want
17:21  moshee: it helped me understand too
17:22  random_buddha: I have resolved my problem using display:table; for the parent div and display:table-cell; for the child, thank you #css
17:23  NickASloan: I figured out my problem in this case, which was unrelated to positioning, but I'll give that article a read-through.

17:24  ComradeHaz`: Anyone else find it slightly ironc w3 are down?! :D
17:25  tw2113: not as ironic as someone showing pictures to random people on the street shouting "DO YOU LIKE THIS? HUH!?!?!" whenever facebook goes down
17:26  tw2113: or everyone suddenly resorting to making tweet sounds when twitter goes down for its annual pms
17:26  ComradeHaz`: I'm not sure you grasp the correct definition of ironic.
17:26  ComradeHaz`: You seem to understand the principal in the same way Alanis Morrisette does.
17:26  tw2113: i know, isn't it ironic?
17:26  MauriceJ: Alanis Morrissette, anyone?
17:27  ComradeHaz`: Canadian winey singer.
17:27  tw2113: i swear she wrote that song that way on purpose solely for the irony of none of the ironic things in the song actually being ironic
17:27  ComradeHaz`: I'd like to think so too, but somehow, I doubt it.
17:28  tw2113: it's too fitting to disregard
17:28  NickASloan: it doing display: block on a span a stupid idea?
17:28  NickASloan: *is
17:30  MauriceJ: NickASloan: Context is always important with a question such as that.
17:30  NickASloan: MauriceJ: so it seems to me that doing display: block on a span makes it the same thing as a div
17:30  NickASloan: since both have no semantic meaning
17:31  MauriceJ: NickASloan: That is incorrect.  I can't believe you just said that.
17:31 * MauriceJ is wondering if Fail Friday came early.
17:31  NickASloan: MauriceJ: enlighten me then...
17:32  MauriceJ: :/ No.  Maybe somebody else in here would care to do all that for you.
17:32  NickASloan: according to wikipedia (sure... it IS wikipedia, but still) "span and div, which have no innate semantic meaning"
17:33  MauriceJ: Why the hell would you try to add the properties of a div to a span rather than simply using a div?!
17:33  NickASloan: MauriceJ: I am getting to that.
17:33 * MauriceJ sings: It's like rain on your wedding day....
17:34  NickASloan: so I might want to split a single paragraph into separate pieces that I can manipulate as blocks, rather than inline
17:34 * Dartfall sings: I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain?
17:34  NickASloan: for whatever reason
17:34  MauriceJ: Dartfall: touche :)
17:34  NickASloan: it seems to be, a span with display: block is more suitable than a div in this case
17:35  NickASloan: *to me
17:35  MauriceJ: NickASloan: Why not just manipulate the P tag then?
17:35  NickASloan: MauriceJ: I want to treat pieces of one paragraph as separate blocks
17:36  speak: "for whatever reason", care to explain what it is exactly that you are doing?
17:36  MauriceJ: NickASloan: Then you do that, you will have no argument from me.  At least you're not using tables to layout your page.
17:37  NickASloan: speak: it's tough to explain since it's for work, and I'd have to mock up a fake design for you to show you what I'm doing without breaking my NDA
17:37  speak: ah, okay.
17:38  NickASloan: speak: but imagine you have a single sentence which is visually displayed on different lines, with different backgrounds.
17:38  speak: yeah i understand your problem now
17:39  NickASloan: so like <p><span>Prices starting as low as </span><span>$29.99</span></p>
17:39  NickASloan: where each span is like it's own block
17:39  speak: intuition says "span", but reasoning says "div"
17:40  speak: so... i'm lost!
17:40  MauriceJ: NickASloan: It just intuitively feels like overcoding to me rather than adding seperate classes to the P tags and using them on each bit you have down there.  But it's not holistically wrong, what you're suggesting in this context.
17:40  ZombieLoffe: I would use span with display: block;
17:40  NickASloan: speak: I'm thinking of a screen reader.
17:40  NickASloan: I want this to be read as one sentence
17:40  NickASloan: I'm worried that divs might break that
17:40  speak: ZombieLoffe yes that's probably what i would do, as well
17:40  MauriceJ: NickASloan: ZombieLoffe knows his shit, do what he says.
17:40  ZombieLoffe: :D
17:40  MauriceJ: ZombieLoffe: ++

17:46  MauriceJ: ie--

17:54  goleif: "murdare han"? Hur pratar du egentligen?
17:54  random_buddha: the law of karma is that the man with the least amount of karma wins. This has been the Buddha. om
17:57  NickASloan: hmm... small gotcha: if you set line-height in ems, the em is based on the font-size of the first parent that is a block level element
17:57  NickASloan: not the first parent that has display: block;
17:57  MauriceJ: goleif: Jag vet inte men jag kan svengelska skitbra.
17:58  goleif: Maurice: Where are you from, then? :p
17:58  MauriceJ: goleif: From a galaxy far far away in the US.
17:59  goleif: Maurice: Possibly Minnesota? Otherwise I can't see any reason to know any Swedish over there xD
18:00  goleif: MauriceJ * even
18:01  MauriceJ: goleif: Ah I see my mistake, should have used henne or whatever it is for 'him'.
18:01  MauriceJ: goleif: Nej, jag e ifrån San Francisco och jag gillar svenskare eller någonting some det.
18:01  urker: hello, this is my 2 column layout. How can I give both columns minimum height? (no fake background img please) http://www.webdevout.net/test?022  to wrok with all browsers (if  there is a problem with ie6  then ie7)
18:02  MauriceJ: urker: I'm not quite sure there is a way to do the two-column layout without that little cheat.
18:03  urker: that involves img?
18:04  MauriceJ: urker: Yes.
18:04  urker: I can't create any image at all :( my design suck badly

18:06  nvictor: hey all
18:06  nvictor: i have a question
18:06  nvictor: so i have a parent element with display:inline-block
18:06  nvictor: and two children float:left and float:right
18:06  nvictor: it works great without a clear
18:06  nvictor: is it supposed to be that way?
18:06  MauriceJ: nvictor: You will be better to give us a test case using the URL in the topic.
18:07  MauriceJ: :D
18:07 * MauriceJ wonders what the problem is.
18:07  speak: if it works and validates, all good!
18:07  nvictor: there is no problem
18:07  MauriceJ: goleif: Jag ska murdare homom. :D
18:08  MauriceJ: nvictor: Did you do overflow:hidden; on the parent element?
18:08  goleif: MauriceJ: Mörda! xD
18:08  nvictor: no
18:08  MauriceJ: goleif: Tackar!
18:08  MauriceJ: :D Ui!
18:08  MauriceJ: nvictor: Well... I don't think you should be worried just yet then.
18:09 * MauriceJ sure has forgotten a lot of swedish.
18:09  nvictor: MauriceJ: ok thanks a lot dude
18:09  MauriceJ: nvictor: You may find problems later but then containing floating elements is easy but setting overflow:hidden; on the parent element.
18:10  manhunter: i want to get text color black in division ,what would be the css for this?
18:10  MauriceJ: s/but/by/
18:10  nvictor: ok
18:10  MauriceJ: manhunter: by setting the background colour for the ID/class/div ?
18:11  MauriceJ: Oh text colour, jesus I'm tired.
18:11  manhunter: MauriceJ, no the text color
18:11  manhunter: not the background color
18:12  manhunter: what's the property?
18:12  manhunter: color: black  , is it ?
18:12  MauriceJ: Yep.
18:19  ComradeHaz`: Hey guys, if I want to specify an image as a background, what's teh best way to do so?
18:19  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: background:url(./path/to/img.jpg);
18:20  ComradeHaz`: in css?
18:21  tw2113: yes
18:21  tw2113: in css
18:22  ComradeHaz`: Hmm, that's what I'm trying... must have something a bit wrong :)
18:22  ComradeHaz`: Ah. :D Typo.
18:23  random_buddha: what is the standard screen res these days? is it 1024 768 ?
18:24  random_buddha: also, should percentages be used instead of pixels where possible?
18:24  ComradeHaz`: random_buddha: apparently percentages.
18:24 * ComradeHaz` on day 2 of learning to write webvsites read that yesterday
18:24  sriley: tbh probably higher than that now but most dont have their browser maximised
18:25  sriley: fixed, fluid, elastic is up to you, they have advantages/disadvantgaes
18:25  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I rarely maximise any windows these days
18:26  random_buddha: fluid has disadvantages when using display:inline-block; ie: i cannot set percentage of li
18:28  random_buddha: it has to be in pixels
18:37  ComradeHaz`: If I make an html file that I want to use as a part of another page, how do I reference it?
18:38  random_buddha: how do you mean ComradeHaz` ?
18:38  random_buddha: you can make an iframe and reference it within the iframe
18:38  ComradeHaz`: Hmm, hard to say. I will upload what I've been playing with in a bit. I have a bunch of questions.
18:39  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Yeah, it will be good to see what you're doing.
18:39  MauriceJ: We can look at your code and give you better advice.
18:39  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, only doing very simple structure atm
18:39  ComradeHaz`: but keen to stick to W3 WXHTML strict or whatever it's called
18:40  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: I recommend HTML4 strict as you're probably not doing anything that needs XHTML at the moment.
18:41  ComradeHaz`: Not yet, but I believe I will be.
18:41  random_buddha: god I hate having to code twice just to support IE
18:41  MauriceJ: Possibly in future so it will be a good idea to larn the foundations well.
18:41  MauriceJ: random_buddha: Om-men.
18:41  ComradeHaz`: Probably, if all goes to plan this will be a servlet driven JDBC site.
18:42  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: God a huge rubber tree plant I see.
18:42  random_buddha: does ie8 support iframe tag?
18:42  MauriceJ: s/God/Got/
18:42  MauriceJ: random_buddha: I don't know, I haven't used iframes since 2000.
18:42  ComradeHaz`: MauriceJ: Learning curve is almost verticle :D
18:42  random_buddha: k
18:43  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: I hear your pain.  In fact the neighbours were wondering....
18:43  ComradeHaz`: Hahaha
18:43  ComradeHaz`: My mother keeps bringing me tea and has stopped moaning at me to do chores. Clearlyt she can sense that'd be dangerous :D
18:43  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Wow, that is indeed a severe situation.
18:44  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: PG Tips?
18:50  ComradeHaz`: What would you call what the following specifies:
18:50  ComradeHaz`: #navLeft {    background:url("images/leftBar.png") no-repeat;    float: left; padding-left: 158px; }
18:51  MauriceJ: An ID with background and float properties?
18:51 * MauriceJ hopes that wasn't a pop quiz quessie.
18:51  tw2113: and a huge left padding
18:52  ComradeHaz`: So when one uses those multiple times, what do you call that process?
18:52  ComradeHaz`: as in to break up the page into areas
18:53  ComradeHaz`: tw2113: yeah, I think I am doing that wrong. I want stuff on top of that bar but obvioulsy padding pushes everything off it. With no padding though, it crops the image.
18:53  ComradeHaz`: Can I define the width another way?
18:53  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Need to see a test case of your code.  Can you use URL in topic?
18:54  ComradeHaz`: I can better that.
18:54  ComradeHaz`: Give me a few min :)
18:54  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Also don't use ID more than once per page, classes are what you want if you need to use more than one instance.
18:54  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Okay thank you.
18:54 * MauriceJ thinks about having another PG Tips.
18:54 * tw2113 wonders what resources ComradeHaz` is using for learning
18:55  ComradeHaz`: bit of this bit of that lot of google.
18:56 --- Curt` is now known as curt`off
18:56 * tw2113 throws out the name htmldog
18:56 --- rstacruz- is now known as rstacruz
18:56  ComradeHaz`: hmm, MauriceJ, I kind of know what you mean re ID, but not sure of alternative
18:57  tw2113: classes
18:57  MauriceJ: ]schools @ ComradeHaz`
18:57  _ZofBot4: ComradeHaz`, Explore the intricacies of HTML and CSS here: http://wsc.opera.com/ , www.htmlhelp.com/ , http://css-discuss.incutio.com/ , www.brainjar.com/ , www.htmldog.com/ , http://css.maxdesign.com.au/
18:57  ComradeHaz`: OK. Lemme tell you the story first of all. I designed a site and had a friend write it for me. She lashed it together in javascript and stuff I think, this is it here: http://harriersview.com/newSite/HarriersView/Cottage.html
18:57  MauriceJ: ]w3schools @ ComradeHaz`
18:57  _ZofBot4: ComradeHaz`, W3Schools == Errors, omissions, deceit.  Stop reading/pointing to them! Syntax Errors in the example --> http://xrl.us/bfxwd | Complete bullshit -> http://xrl.us/bfxwf | Can't get it even more wrong if tried --> http://xrl.us/bfxwh
18:58  takeout: heyo..  how can i cancel out a background.  like if I have:  a{background:white;} and i want a.nobg to be transparent?
18:58  MauriceJ: takeout: background:none;
18:58  ComradeHaz`: I am now trying to totally rewrite without any nasty script as I describe above. Later there will be stuff added to that, but this is my start point.
18:58  takeout: MauriceJ: you the man!  thx
18:59  MauriceJ: takeout: You're welcome, mate.
18:59  tw2113: ]doctype
18:59  _ZofBot4: Take a gander at the fine document type definitions available here: http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html (HTML 4.01 Strict is recommended)
18:59  tw2113: that site needs one
19:00  MauriceJ: Woah, that is indeed true.  Site is in 'quirksmode'.
19:00  stygyan: hey guys.
19:00  tw2113: with code barf
19:00  stygyan: you're not going to believe what i just found
19:00  tw2113: someone using IE5.5?
19:00  stygyan: a website that looks perfect on IE, but not on the other major browsers.
19:01  tw2113: does it validate?
19:01  speak: BHAHAHAHAHA
19:01  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: Plus that site is made using table for layout which is bad.  http://badhtml.comeze.com/
19:01  speak: good one tw2113
19:01  stygyan: that's what i'm looking right now into
19:01  ComradeHaz`: MauriceJ: indeed.
19:01  tw2113: if it looks great in IE* and not in other browsers, chances are that it won't, and that it was designed explicitly for IE
19:02  tw2113: and is thus evil and a bane to the interweb
19:03  ComradeHaz`: OK, this is the page I'm messing with at the moment
19:03  ComradeHaz`: http://lithitux.org/~haz/home.html
19:07  stygyan: tw2113, my god.
19:07  stygyan: this is not a bane.
19:07  stygyan: this is madness.
19:08  stygyan: i just parsed it
19:08  stygyan: there where three <head> tags.
19:08  stygyan: four body tags.
19:09  tw2113: linkage so we can see?
19:09  tw2113: and if you want another atrocity...go look at subway's site
19:09  stygyan: atrocitys are fun to see once in a while
19:09  stygyan: but they're not if you've got to repair them
19:10  stygyan: the problem was that IE managed to see the css rules. the other browsers couldn't.
19:12  jones-: Hello. Can anyone help me with something? I can't figure out why the box with the "Share link" right under the big image is not aligned with the texts left and right of it.
19:12  jones-: http://www.astrobin.com/show/1/
19:13  jones-: Firebug shows me the <li> in which the "Messier 39" text is to be very thin.
19:13  jones-: I would like to have everything vertically aligned in that <ul>.
19:22  stygyan: ok, it almost validate.
19:22  stygyan: the only things wrong with it are the width/height attributes.
19:23  stygyan: it keeps on not reaching the css files, tho
19:49  jen_: Can someone recommend a  complete CSS lightbox that is compatible with the major browsers?  thanks.
19:50  systemfault: lightbox?
19:51  systemfault: The question is weird :/
19:51  jen_: lightbox, greybox, thickbox -- all overlays
19:52  jen_: c'mon, don't tell me you don't know what the heck a lightbox is?
19:52  Soopaman: hola all
19:52  systemfault: jen_: That's the problem... Use lightbox?
19:52  Soopaman: when accessing attribute values within the properties of a selector, can i continue to look up/down the dom?
19:53  jen_: using a lightbox is problematic? Please elaborate on your thoughts.
19:53  systemfault: It's like asking: "Can someone recommend a browser like firefox that works on the major OS?" thanks
19:53  systemfault: Use firefox?
19:54  Soopaman: ala foo.bar { element("span[title]"): attr(title); } ?
19:55 * foo smacks Soopaman 
19:55  MauriceJ: jen_: Generally #css is not a place that recommends anything and only helps with CSS problems that people are having with their code.
19:56  jen_: thanks.
19:59  Seppoz: hello, im having a wrapper div using "width:inherit; display:table;" and 2 child using " float:left; display:table-column;" now i have 2 qestions, how do i get the left of the 2 child divs the same height as the bigger right one , and how do i get the right of the child divs so that its width is the remairing of the wrapper-left (so that it fills)
19:59  Soopaman: foo: ?
20:01  MauriceJ: Soopaman: You highlighted him.
20:01  MauriceJ: Seppoz: I think I have somethign to help you but hold on.
20:02  Seppoz: MauriceJ: thanks tyty
20:02  MauriceJ: Seppoz: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/
20:02  Soopaman: oh
20:03  Seppoz: MauriceJ: well the proplem is that i cant say how height the divs are going to be
20:03  Seppoz: neither can i say how width the left one is going to be
20:05  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Hrm...
20:05  Seppoz: http://img87.imageshack.us/i/clipboard02ve.jpg/
20:05  Seppoz: its like that
20:05  Seppoz: see the line right net to the cover
20:05  Seppoz: thats the height of the image div
20:06  Seppoz: and he white box indicates the width of the right child div
20:06  Seppoz: i want the right side to fill
20:06  Seppoz: and the image to be same height as the right stats
20:07  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Hrm... I would need some working code to look at.
20:08  Seppoz: sure sec
20:08  Seppoz: http://pastebin.com/6meL27QL
20:09 --- Aku is now known as Akufen
20:10  MauriceJ: Seppoz: It helps if you put it into the URL in the topic because that actually makes it working code, jsut remember that for future.
20:10  Seppoz: actually its offline
20:11  MauriceJ: webdev?
20:11  Seppoz: so there is no url
20:11  Seppoz: oh, what did you mean
20:11  Seppoz: i think i got you wrong
20:11  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Check the topic of this channel :)
20:11  Seppoz: ahh ok im sorry
20:12  Seppoz: will remeber next time
20:14  MauriceJ: Seppoz: All good, thank you. =)
20:16  Seppoz: its just im not good with css, and i really dont see the mistake here
20:16  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Yeah I can't tell from the pastebin, can you put that into webdev for me?
20:18  Seppoz: sure, sec
20:18  MauriceJ: Thank you, mate, sorry about that.

20:20  ravenzz: hello
20:20  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Thanks mate, I hope I can help you after all of that. =)
20:21  Seppoz: thanks
20:21  Seppoz: actually in that webdev ste stretch works in IE, in opera it dont, when using the real content it works neither in ie nor opera
20:21  Seppoz: the height thing works in none
20:22  ravenzz: i have a problem with the divx player and his transparency
20:22  ravenzz: <param name="wmode" value="transparent"> and wmode="transparent" within the embed tag
20:23  ravenzz: doesn't work
20:23  ravenzz: i have to overlay a div onto the player
20:23  Seppoz: cant you just use position absolute?
20:24  ravenzz: i'm already doing that
20:24  Seppoz: oh, and the player still overlays the div?
20:24  ravenzz: but the divx web player still overlays that div
20:24  ravenzz: yep
20:25  Seppoz: im not sure if this is possible at all since the player is basically implemented differently
20:25  Seppoz: i think that the render will always make it top
20:25  Seppoz: im not 100% sure tho
20:26  ravenzz: uhm
20:27  ravenzz: i will google a little bit
20:27  MauriceJ: Seppoz: One of the problems you are having is caused by the use of <br> in your code.
20:27  MauriceJ: Seppoz: When I clean up your code this is what happens: http://www.webdevout.net/test?027
20:28  ravenzz: oh
20:28  ravenzz: it should be an ff issue http://labs.divx.com/node/15127
20:28  ravenzz: :°
20:28  kevindank2: Hello, im using mediawiki and i know to hide something on the main page i'd use something similar to body.page-Main_Page h1.firstHeading { display:none; }
20:28  Seppoz: MauriceJ: just enter a multiline description and add some lines, and you will have the same proplem :(
20:29  MauriceJ: Seppoz: The use of <br> is actually poor form and has come to be understood as using HTML as presentational code rather than semantic.  So what you really want to do is use the CSS to control what is happening.
20:29  kevindank2: i want to hide an id thats on that page instead, is it possible to have a class and then hide an id?
20:29  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Hrm....
20:29  kevindank2: the id is #Contributionscores which is in body.page-Main_Page
20:29  Seppoz: http://www.webdevout.net/test?028
20:29  Seppoz: just see
20:29  Seppoz: :(
20:29  jones-: Hi. I'm debugging my css with Firebug, and I have a ul with 3 lis inside, and the ul seems to have 0 height. Does anybody know why?
20:30  ravenzz: kevindank2 yes
20:31  MauriceJ: Seppoz: When you want the left div to become the same height as the right div is the purpose to have the image vertically centred or will there be a background or?
20:31  kevindank2: ravenzz: im attempting to do it but its not working body.page-Main_Page #ContributionCredits
20:31  Seppoz: MauriceJ: well no, the intention is to have a seperator line down to the bottom
20:31  ravenzz: 1st of all you can simply use #ContributionCredits
20:31  ravenzz: then try with display:none !important;
20:32  kevindank2: i dont want to hide it totally, i want to hide it from one page only
20:32  ravenzz: oh
20:32  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Ah then would it be all right to use border-left:1px solid #color; ?
20:32  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Sorry I mean use that on the right div instead.
20:32  ravenzz: can't your edit the php?
20:32  ravenzz: that's should be the best pratique
20:33  Seppoz: MauriceJ: ahh yes good idea!
20:33  kevindank2: i guess i could,  could i use something like body.page-Main_Page div#p-cactions { display:none; }
20:33  Seppoz: but i still have the proplem with the width of the right div
20:33  Seppoz: and i was also think of centering the image
20:33  Seppoz: i really dont understand why that happens thb
20:34  MauriceJ: Seppoz: http://www.webdevout.net/test?029
20:34  ravenzz: kevindank2 just try, also add an !important next to display:none
20:34  ravenzz: display:none !important;
20:34  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Okay let me continue on that problem. =) *thinks a bit*
20:35  ravenzz: JDigital i guess you are l33t :f
20:35  ravenzz: JDigital is the any known issues on divx web player and his transparency on ff?
20:35  ravenzz: *there
20:37  MauriceJ: Seppoz: I can tell you that part of the problem with the right div not filling the rest of the parent is because it's made to float.
20:39  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Technically you don't even need to put the image into a separate div, I just thought you might want to know that, as well.
20:39  Seppoz: oh
20:41  ravenzz: what's the matter sep?
20:42  Seppoz: having some issues with autosizeing
20:42  JDigital: ravenzz: is it one of those flash players
20:43  JDigital: maybe wmode=transparnet
20:43  JDigital: transparent
20:43  ravenzz: eh it doen't work
20:43  ravenzz: +s
20:44  ravenzz: Seppoz which issues?
20:44  Seppoz: sec
20:45  Seppoz:  im having a wrapper div using "width:inherit; display:table;" and 2 child using " float:left; display:table-column;" now i have 2 qestions, how do i get the left of the 2 child divs the same height as the bigger right one , and how do i get the right of the child divs so that its width is the remairing of the wrapper-left (so that it fills)
20:45  Seppoz: MauriceJ: whats the way of having 2 non-float div next to each other?
20:45  MauriceJ: Seppoz: display:inline;
20:46  MauriceJ: Seppoz: display inline will also shrink the divs so that's not a solution for you.
20:46  MauriceJ: I am absolutely fried tonight. :/  I think I'l have to stop here.
20:46  MauriceJ: I'm afraid of screwing somebody up.
20:46  MauriceJ: JDigital: can you help Seppoz  out, mate?
20:47  MauriceJ: Seppoz: Definitely use that border-left thing for your other issue, though.
20:47  JDigital: ]fullheight @ Seppoz

20:58  ShawnRisk: goleif: hi
20:59  goleif: ShawnRisk Evenin'
20:59  Seppoz: anyways guys, thanks for your help
20:59  ShawnRisk: goleif: do you have IE6 or other versions?
21:00  goleif: ShawnRisk: Nope, sorry. I do Chrome and Firefox.
21:02  ShawnRisk: goleif: I fixed up the other two issues.  There is just one more someone said: In internet explorer, indentation is messed up.  I have no IE to test
21:05  goleif: ShawnRisk: Someone else will have to help you look :) But it probably just needs a simple fix. Padding/margin problem.
21:05  ShawnRisk: But where, the screenshot is too small for me to see?
21:07  ravenzz: http://browserling.com/
21:23  meway: Hello this might be the wrong channel but idk where else to look. Does anyone have information about adding video to a website. I have a server with the video on it and a webpage. <- I want the video on the webpage. Any ideas or good links?
21:24  meway: also the server and its webpage are offline not connected to the internet.
21:24  wojciech_fornal: hi
21:24  meway: the video is already on the machine
21:24  wojciech_fornal: I have'a problem with links
21:24  wojciech_fornal: <a href=
21:24  wojciech_fornal: text links
21:24  wojciech_fornal: when I click them, elements that are on the right move slightly
21:26  wojciech_fornal: link1  link2  link3
21:26  wojciech_fornal: when i click link1
21:26  wojciech_fornal: it looks like
21:26  wojciech_fornal: link1      link2  link3
21:27  Soopaman: is it possible to have a properly within an selector reference a specific property of another selector?
21:28  Soopaman: property*
21:28 --- will_hough is now known as will_Ubuntu
21:28 --- BertieKong is now known as will_hough
21:33  wojciech_fornal: ok, found the problem
21:33  wojciech_fornal: force padding: 0px; on each of the link state
21:33  wojciech_fornal: thank you all for listening ;P
21:38  plow: can someone tell me if it is illegal to borrow someone else's CSS in any circumstances?
21:38  Soopaman: i believe it is if you copy it entirely and not give due credit
21:39  plow: I like www.hipmunk.com 's
21:39  plow: Soopaman: so if I took the odd button styling?
21:39  Soopaman: and try to pass it off as your own original creation
21:40  plow: Soopaman: I'll retheme it then I think
21:40  Soopaman: but those are my interpretations
21:40  Soopaman: if you're gonna sample, give credit
21:40  Soopaman: much like musicians
21:41  plow: Soopaman: think I will do that, thanks Soopa
21:42  amh345: hi guys, i've got a script that expands a div.  it pushes the other divs down when it expands.  is there a way using css to just make it overflow onto the other divs when it expands or is this a js thing?
21:43  jen_: This is so weird.  I have a class named "functions" and inspection of the page with Firebug shows the class as "functioffs".   Any thoughts...
21:44  jen_: site: http://mergepdfmac.com/details.html , click on screenshots.
21:44  jen_: enlarge one of the thumbs.
21:45  qvarkkie: can someone please help me understand this (regarding inline-block) /// http://niklasthorin.se/tmp/
21:45  qvarkkie: if you are using firebug, you'll se that the yellow items expand outside the div, but still not
21:45  qvarkkie: i want the headline to be exactly as wide as the other lis
21:50  jen_: for some reason, renaming "functions" to "func" did the trick.
21:51  ShawnRisk: can someone check indytaxservice.com on ie6 or others ie browsers and tell me why the indent is messed up?
21:52  joaoramos: any grid gurus ou there?
21:52  joaoramos: * out
21:53  kithpom: How can I get html style shadowed table borders using CSS?

21:55  kithpom: amh345: hiya
21:55  amh345: :)
21:55  draginx: http://i.imgur.com/wRlEY.png Any idea why my images would be seperate like that? They are suppose to be *right* next to each other with no spacing nin between (the black squares)
21:56  ShawnRisk: goleif: still around?  I am unsure about the bullets and image here, the bullets overlap the image.  http://indytaxservice.com/services/
21:57  wathek: Hi all
21:58  qvarkkie: now it works good, but not in ie7 :(
21:59  wathek: would any one help me to fix a css issue in my site ? http://solutions30.gedeom.com using safari the menu is screwed up when you visit one link
22:00  joelklabo: how do you center a div vertically?
22:00  qvarkkie: joelklabo: got an example site?
22:01  Sample: is assigning an ID on the body tag okay? i assume so, just making sure
22:01  goleif: ShawnRisk: I'll take a look
22:02  ShawnRisk: thanks
22:03  joelklabo: no, I am working on it. I just saw that it is supposed to be centered vertically and horizontally, with resizing
22:04  joelklabo: I get the horizontal part but vertical is not so clear to me...
22:04  Cork[home]: joelklabo: google css dead center
22:04  goleif: ShawnRisk: Alright, I understand the problem. Have you tried  li {margin-left: 20px;}  ?
22:04  foo: gah, probably overthinking this, but jpg for photo type images, pngs for everything else? yay or nay?
22:05  joelklabo: Cork[home]: thanks
22:05  ShawnRisk: goleif: thanks I get it
22:06  goleif: ShawnRisk no problem
22:06  Cork[home]: joelklabo: side note, you can't center things verticaly except in table cells, but it can be hacked around
22:07  joelklabo: interesting
22:08  goleif: Cork Then how about display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; ?  That centers vertically and doesn't simulate any table cell.
22:09  Cork[home]: goleif: that center on the line, not in the ex. parent div
22:09  Cork[home]: (line as in text line)
22:09  goleif: Hm. You're right. But it's still possible, if the element to be centered has a static height.
22:10  Cork[home]: goleif: by padding, ya
22:10  Cork[home]: but thats still hacks
22:10  goleif: Yeah, I guess. But CSS hacks doesn't really bring any negative effects
22:10  Cork[home]: whats missing for making these things work non hacky is vertical-align for block objects
22:11  Cork[home]: goleif: vertical centering has almost always problems
22:11  Cork[home]: especially, if you can't restrain the parents dimetions
22:12  ShawnRisk: goleif: not working
22:13 --- bencahill_ is now known as bencahill
22:14 * foo reads http://css-tricks.com/when-to-use-jpg-and-when-to-use-gif/
22:14  ShawnRisk: goleif: the bullets are not moving.  I tried the #content li { margin-left: 15px; }
22:14  goleif: ShawnRisk: Can't you just  use float:right; on the image instead? It looks a little weird to break the list like that anyway.
22:16  ShawnRisk: yep I know
22:16  ShawnRisk: I can do that instead
22:17  coreyw: Not sure if this is possible with CSS(3). But I'm trying to make a page with a HEADER that is variant in height. And then have the body below it stretch to fit the rest of the window. Right now I'm just using "min-height:100%", but that header is added to the 100% so its causing scrolling
22:18 * foo researches if images on submit buttons are bad 
22:20  ShawnRisk: goleif: thanks for helping me so much
22:24  goleif: ShawnRisk: No problem, that's what we're here for
22:26  ShawnRisk: goleif: just one more question, should the size of the a link be larger or be on the tab or something else?
22:28  goleif: ShawnRisk: Do you mean the menu tabs?
22:28  goleif: ShawnRisk: Smaller size, and bold. I think. :)
22:28  ShawnRisk: goleif: yep the ones that start with get started
22:28  ShawnRisk: I am talking a link on there
22:29  ShawnRisk: a href link
22:29  goleif: ShawnRisk: Yep. A little bit smaller, and bold (fat)
22:31  ShawnRisk: goleif: oh okay no height or width change?
22:33  goleif: ShawnRisk: Right now, in Chrome, the links are 2 pixels too high up
22:34  ShawnRisk: goleif: thnaks
22:34  ShawnRisk: thanks
22:34  goleif: np!
22:47  Bartzy: What's the best CSS minifier/compressor? YUI ?
22:50  Sample: is assigning an ID on the body tag okay? i assume so, just making sure
22:50  oksushi: Sample: yes
22:50  Sample: k
22:52  Bartzy: What's the best CSS minifier/compressor? YUI ?
22:53  blackice2999: Bartzy: i think yui compressor makes a good job
23:15  Aliv3: do you think it would be a good idea to have a horizontal drop down site map, with different sections, and in one of them it would have like history,bookmarks, and save it in a cookie or something?
23:21  oksushi: no
23:24  dregan: there is an issue that i keep scratching my head over, how do i change my backgournd color of the (featured Box) on to black instead of grey?  the site is   djbl3nd.com
23:25  dregan: i tried looking in loopslider.js (jquery) for anything about color but it does not have any color options
23:33  oksushi: dregan: change the background on #featPostsSmall from #252525
23:33  oksushi: to #000
23:34  dregan: oksushi, thank you i did not notice the style.css file *sillyme*
23:34  dregan: thanks :)
23:35  dregan: oksushi, how about inserting a background image into the box
23:35  dregan: just like the one currently on the webpage
23:35  oksushi: just adjust the same background
23:35  dregan: instead of all black
23:35  dregan: hmm but i want to use an image
23:35  dregan: not color
23:35  oksushi: then use an image
23:35  oksushi: ]css background @ dregan
23:35  _ZofBot4: dregan, css background: http://w3.org/TR/CSS21/colors.html#propdef-background

23:45  oksushi: @
23:45  _ZofBot4: (fuel-man...?id=3) HTML: Valid ( http://xrl.us/biemus ) CSS: Valid ( http://xrl.us/biemuw ) DOCTYPE: HTML 4.0 Transitional (MIME: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 )
23:45  oksushi: iaj: change to a strict doctype and revalidate
23:46  oksushi: also, fix your css errors
23:46  oksushi: (you are lacking some units of measurement)
23:49  kithpom: how do I specify two elements to use the same class styles?
23:51  tw2113: so, one class declaration in your css, used in 2 different places?
23:51  tw2113: in the markup
23:51  tw2113: am i correct?
23:51  kithpom: tw2113: I want to apply styling for a class on th and td tags.
23:52  amh345: my parent divs width is it maintaining it's defined pixel.  but the heigh keeps expanding despite it being defined as well.  is there a reason for this?
23:52  oksushi: kithpom: table th, table td {…}
23:52  tw2113: so <th class="foo"> <td class="foo">
23:52  kithpom: tw2113: right
23:52  tw2113: and what oksushi said
23:52  oksushi: amh345: hard to say without seeing the page
23:52  tw2113: kinda
23:52  tw2113: .foo { border: solid red 1px;}
23:53  amh345: oksushi: i posted something on jsfiddle- but it works there. for some reason.
23:53  tw2113: would apply to both th and td, if they both have that class applied
23:53  amh345: despite it being a paste of my code exactly.
23:53  oksushi: amh345: then fix your own code. Validating is a good start
23:53  amh345: it is my code on jsfiddle.  that's the part that's confusing.
23:53  kithpom: tw2113: hm, I have two specifications for the class styling. I wanted one for table and one for td th.
23:54  tw2113: so table .foo1 {} table .foo2 {}
23:54 --- Unknown[OFF] is now known as Unknown[NF]
23:54  tw2113: or if you want the same properties applied to both
23:54  tw2113: table .foo1, td .foo2 { single declaration }
23:55  tw2113: i typo'd above
23:55  kithpom: tw2113: I have one class name. two styles. one I want to apply to table and one to both td and th.
23:55  amh345: oksushi, here is my pastie http://jsfiddle.net/EhCkj/  here it functions.
23:55  kithpom: tw2113: so I should do td .foo, th .foo {...} ?
23:55  dregan: how can i exclude a certain advertisment from showing up on the homepage, and only showing on the single posts page?
23:55  oksushi: amh345: …
23:56  oksushi: dregan: remove them from your html
23:56  tw2113: table .foo { style 1 }
23:56  tw2113: td .foo, th .foo { style 2 }
23:56  tw2113: should do it
23:56  tw2113: since we're specifying different items that the class is applied to
23:57  tw2113: if you were to do just .foo { ... } it'd get applied to all of them
23:58  amh345: got it!
23:59  kithpom: tw2113: doesn't seem to be working. I think I will just use two classes. Thanks for your help.
