10:30  iaj: hello :)
10:30  iaj: is there any good template for a html file based on a 4row content?
10:35  rnenjoy: Anyone know if there is some workaround to get "zoom" working in other browsers than IE?
10:37  riven: rnenjoy: transform: scale(X)
10:38  rnenjoy: thanks dude
10:39  riven: rnenjoy: will need vendor prefix for some (or all) supporting browsers
10:49  jarek: riven: zoom property is supported by most browsers
10:51  riven: jarek: [citation needed] ... pretty usre it's just IE and recent webkit
10:51  riven: sure*
10:52  jarek: riven: that's around 80% of the market :P
10:53  jarek: and for firefox there is   -moz-transform: scale(0.85);  -moz-transform-origin: 0 0;
10:53  riven: jarek: Yes, I said that, no?
10:54  riven: Go be a smartass somewhere else, thanks.
10:54  jarek: riven: yeah, I just wanted to note that it's not IE-only propery any longer
10:55  jarek: s/propery/property
10:56  riven: Doesn't change the fact that it's non-standard - and all non-IE browsers support the standards way to do this. So let's see... you're gonna need 'transform' anyway if you want it cross-browser... 'transform' is standard... non-IE browsers that support 'zoom' also support 'transform' .. hmm... touch choice
10:56  riven: tough*
11:04  codestr0m: HappyPelican: oh when hwen I add the -moz-border-radius: I get css3 validation failures :(
11:04  riven: no way!
11:04  riven: so what, codestr0m?
11:05  pixolin: Hello. Again I have one of those beautiful design flaws in lte IE 7: at http://www.drechsler-kohlmann.de/wp/ I get a 1px gap on the right side of a container/wrapper, which just looks ugly. Any known work arounds for that?
11:05  codestr0m: riven: that's exactly the attitude holding the web back for maybe 15 years now.. /* me goes to work and doesn't feed the troll */
11:06  riven: codestr0m: wow you're dumb.
11:06  riven: Validation is not a goal - just a tool, moron
11:07  riven: Ah, I missed an opportunity to say "just a tool, tool". Shame on me.
11:08  riven: codestr0m: if it makes you feel any better, vendor prefixes are perfectly standard: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords
11:08  pixolin: Oh heavenly peace. It's nice to see you foolin' around ... :-) Any suggestions for my styling problem, though?
11:09  riven: pixolin: where, exactly?
11:10  pixolin: in Internet Explorer less then IE7 I have a gap at the right side of my #container
11:10  pixolin: at least I see it in IE6 and IETester
11:10  jarek: codestr0m: I remember there was an option in w3c validator that allows you to enable vendor extensions
11:11  jarek: I mean the new Unicorn validator: http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/
11:12  riven: pixolin: ie6 is dead... please confirm that the issue actually exists in ie7 and I'll have a look
11:12  codestr0m: jarek: ack on vendor extensions and thanks for the tip
11:13  jarek: codestr0m: uhm... it looks like the option is not there any longer
11:13  pixolin: riven: I don't have a running version of IE7, but in IETester it shows me the same flaw (1px gap right border between green background and shadow)
11:14  codestr0m: jarek: could you see why -moz-border-radius: isn't working here http://www.pathscale.com/node/239
11:15  riven: pixolin: ah, that sounds like the classic rounding error... make the gap between left and right shadow 1px smaller
11:15  jarek: codestr0m: Drupal, nice :)
11:15  riven: pixolin: (and yes, that will have a negative effect on other browsers - but you won't be able to actually see the difference ;)
11:15  codestr0m: jarek: is that sarcasm? (I sure hope so)  (I'm using FF-3.5 and in a small test case it works just fine)
11:16  riven: s/drupal/drufail/
11:16  jarek: codestr0m: no, I just love Drupal
11:16  pixolin: riven: I thought, that error occurs, if the container has an odd width?
11:16  riven: pixolin: not necessarily... also when the viewport width is odd
11:16  codestr0m: jarek: if you see this template we paid for you'd not be so in love.. :-( and now I'm doing all sorts of fighting to finish it myself
11:16  jarek: codestr0m: on which element -moz-border-radius is used?
11:17  pixolin: riven: OK, I see. That's what comes from using a 960 grid ...
11:17  codestr0m: in the source for that page you should see <div class="rndme"  > 			  This example of a div with rounded corners uses markup. 		</div>
11:17  codestr0m: the .rndme class works in my small test, but not real page
11:17  jarek: codestr0m: I'm specializing in Drupal theming, so if you want I get get it done for you
11:17  riven: pixolin: as much as I hate 960gs, this has nothing to do with it :p
11:18  jarek: s/I get/I can get
11:18  pixolin: at least I'll give it a try.
11:18  riven: Specializing in Fail, now that's something
11:18  jarek: riven: Drupal is awesome, you just must learn it a bit more
11:18 * riven snickers
11:18  codestr0m: jarek: you're welcome to pm me about this
11:18  jarek: riven: way more powerful than any other CMS
11:19  riven: jarek: LOL
11:19  riven: jarek: LOL
11:19  riven: jarek: LOL
11:19  riven: wow
11:19  riven: you did NOT just say that
11:19  jarek: riven: do you mean me?
11:19  riven: Seriously, I'm almost dying laughing here
11:20  jarek: riven: Seriously, you seem to have a bad day today
11:20  riven: Yes, silly people like you seem to have that effect on me
11:20  riven: No worries
11:20  riven: At least you made me laugh
11:20 * codestr0m <3 /ignore
11:22  pixolin: btw ... you night have seen, that I use a fixed horizontal navigation, followed by the header with a margin oh the height of that navigation. While IE 8 and 9 display correct, IE 7 ignores the top-margin for the header. I dealt with that using html>body header {margin-top: 32px;} but don't feel comfortable with that as long as I don't have a clue what causes the error.
11:24  Superman_: ..
11:28  pixolin: is there a known issue with position fixed and following margin-top?
11:35  iaj: i got a question.. im about to make a white site on a greyish background that shall drop a shadow.. is there any easy way to achieve that?  the size of the site shouldn't be fixed.
11:40  norbi: hello guys, how can i remove the border of an input in chrome when it is on focus?
11:46  pixolin: iaj: a fixed width wrapper plus shadows is rather easy as you just create the shadows in photoshop and set the jpeg as centered background. But if you want to have a flexible width of your wrapper, my first thougth would be to float a box with background shadow, wrapper with flexible width, shadow
11:47  jarek: norbi: I'm not really sure, but have you tried input:focus { outline: none; }?
11:47  jarek: norbi: if that won't work I'm afraid you can't remove it
11:47  jarek: norbi: ohh... and try using the !important flag
11:47  pixolin: iaj: problem then would be to stretch the shadows to the same height as the wrapper.
11:55  norbi: jarek: it works!
11:55  norbi: thanks!

12:18  matt__: Hi All
12:18  matt__: ith a fluid width website, im creating a tree based list
12:19  matt__: which i want to be 100% width, however as it indents the 100% flows over the edge f the containing div
12:19  matt__: how do you stop that?
12:20  davzie: Show us your markup matt__
12:21  davzie: Can someone give me a pointer as to the best way to achieve something in CSS? Take this page for example: http://squibbgroup.swandesign.com/group/key_personnel
12:22  davzie: Now each li for those personnel have a padding-bottom of 10px. This is perfect as it is consistant with the padding of the container making it nice and clean looking
12:22  davzie: However at the bottom of the list (which is dynamically generated by the way) there is also still a padding of 10px, which means with that plus the padding already on the container there is this odd double padding at the bottom of the page, I can't think for the life of me a way around it
12:24  riven: davzie: make it padding-top (or margin-top) instead, then pull the entire list up by the same amount with a negative top margin.
12:25  davzie: riven, absolute hero =)
12:25  davzie: Cheers buddy
12:25  riven: np
12:25  matt__: davzie: http://pastebin.com/WjFpNmDV
12:25  matt__: davzie: the whole thing is within a UL (forgot to paste it)
12:27  davzie: matt__, instead of setting the li to 100%, put a container around everything and set that to 100%
12:27  davzie: That way you can control it better
12:27  Aragon: matt__, dont give your list width: 100%; try display: block; instead and put a container with width:100%; around the list
12:28  matt__: ok, ill try that now
12:28  matt__: thanks
12:28  matt__: so around the starting UKL's?
12:28  matt__: UL's?
12:28  Aragon: yes
12:31  matt__: and display block on the LI?
12:31  riven: LIs are block-level by default
12:32  matt__: ive put a div around it, 100% width
12:32  matt__: and removed the 100% width from the li
12:32  matt__: but isnt making across the screen now
12:32  riven: matt__: ... why are you floating the list items?
12:33  matt__: ahh dont need the float now...
12:33  matt__: thanks!
12:33  riven: don't float anything, don't set any explicit widths.
12:33  matt__: hmm
12:33  matt__: loosks wonderful
12:33  matt__: but has brokent eh jstree :(
12:35  matt__: sorted, perfect
12:35  matt__: thanks guys, ill remember that one
12:50  teamcoltra: http://digitalpatriots.org I want to move my DONATE button up over the navigation bar
12:52  teamcoltra: I was thinking of doing some ABSOLUTE or something I don't know... thats why I am here asking you guys? How can I move an element up from its current position and on top of every other element
12:53  davzie: teamcoltra, you're probably better off changing the colours / graphic and changing the HTML structure
12:53  oksushi: teamcoltra: #sidebar {margin-top: -150px;}
12:54  oksushi: but, you have some dodgy shit going on - you are using <center> for example
12:55  teamcoltra: I was just kinda hacking things together until I got here to get help from you guys
12:55  oksushi: yeah, well
12:55  oksushi: using <center> is not easier than centering an element properly
12:56  teamcoltra: >.> umm is it text-align: center?
12:57  jarek: teamcoltra: use "text-align: center" to center inline elements and "margin: 0 auto" to center block elements
12:58  teamcoltra: and an image is an inline element?
12:58  jarek: teamcoltra: afair it's block element by default
12:59  jarek: but I might be wrong - I always work with images wrapped with some additional divs
13:01  teamcoltra: Okay I tried both of those within the image itself: with style="margin: 0 auto" and style="text-align: center"
13:01  HappyPelican: oh dear
13:01  teamcoltra: but I am assuming thats not proper because ... that didn't work :P
13:01 --- dnordstrom|away is now known as dnordstrom

13:02  _ZofBot4: teamcoltra, CSS Horizontal Centering: http://haslayout.net/css-tuts/Horizontal-Centering  http://dorward.me.uk/www/centre/
13:03  HappyPelican: "margin: 0 auto;" can only be applied to block level elements. You apply it to the element you want to center related to the parent. "text-align: center;" would be applied  to the parent to center child inline elements ...
13:05  jarek: HappyPelican: to be more specif, "margin: 0 auto" can only be applied to block level elements or inline elements with "display: block" :P
13:05  HappyPelican: haha
13:05  jarek: s/specif/specific
13:05  HappyPelican: you're yanking my chain right?
13:07  lonimurar: I have a <p> in a fixed width <div>, how can I align the <p> to the right without giving it a width?
13:07  HappyPelican: if an inline element has display:block; it's no longer considered an inline element in any way - it's a block level element ... but I get what you're trying to say
13:07  oksushi: lonimurar: text-align: right
13:08  oksushi: or, float it to the right
13:08  lonimurar: float! of course
13:08  lonimurar: ty
13:08  oksushi: yw
13:09  jarek: but floats tricky
13:09  psicotico: hi
13:10  psicotico: #menu li { declaration here; } whats the name of this ? its nesting or grouping ?
13:10  lonimurar: oh and I also need it to have position: absolute; I guess float won't work then?
13:10  jarek: psicotico: it's a CSS rule?
13:10  psicotico: well the # sign isn't the #id selector ? so how could it accep the li tag
13:10  oksushi: lonimurar: then justgive it rght: 0;
13:10  oksushi: ]css select @ psicotico
13:10  _ZofBot4: psicotico, CSS Selectors: 1) read: http://xrl.us/bemweo [CSS2.1] http://xrl.us/bemwem [CSS3], http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/ , http://www.csarven.ca/css-specificity-and-selectors 2) Try it out: http://penguin.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py
13:11  jarek: psicotico: it's a descendant selector
13:11  jarek: psicotico: it selects all li elements that are descendant to #menu
13:12  lonimurar: oksushi: then it aligns it to the right of the whole wrapper div, if I add position:relative; to the parent <div> it disppears :s
13:12  chrisfrog: hello

13:43  mekwall: do you guys recommend any other css reset but Meyer's?
13:43  lukus: mekwall, i think the yui one's okay
13:43  HappyPelican: Yes, none, or custom if needed
13:45  mekwall: none? heh
13:46  HappyPelican: Yep, none
13:47  mekwall: I would have to normalize it one way or another, or it wouldn't look the same in every browser
13:47  mekwall: so no resetting isn't viable
13:47  HappyPelican: I often use none and reset elements within their declaration. Particularly if I have < 150 declarations
13:48  mekwall: margin and padding in every declaration? :P
13:49  HappyPelican: if I'm declaring them anyway, there's no need to reset them
13:50  HappyPelican: For the few elements that are margin:0;padding:0; I might 'reset' them at the top of my file if needed. But if you are setting margins/paddings later on, why bother resetting them at the top?
13:50  HappyPelican: http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/no_css_reset/
13:54  lukus: I reckon resets are useful (if not essential)
13:54  lukus: I can see what that guy's saying .. but he says "I'm okay if one browser displays an H1 a few pixels larger or smaller than other browsers. " .. I'm not really
13:55  riven: lukus: that's not the point, silly
13:55  lukus: I reckon it's a good idea to use a resets script .. and then possibly add a base script
13:55  riven: You're going to be setting them anyway - no need to "reset" first.
13:55  HappyPelican: I almost always set margins/paddings on my h1s at some time or another, I definitely don't bother resetting them at the top or in a css reset
13:56  riven: lukus: nothing you've ever reckoned makes any sense, so that doesn't mean much
13:56  lukus: resets script = level the ground before building
13:56  riven: but hey, stay ignorant ;)
13:56  HappyPelican: lukus, to continue your analogy. You're leveling the ground, then before putting in the carpet, you level the ground again
13:57  lukus: I see what you're saying HappyPelican - but if you're making use of the 'cascading' part of CSS .. you'll be depending more on the defaults
13:58  lukus: (that the reset has levelled)
13:58  riven: wow, you are so clueless, it's not even funny
13:58  riven: an infant could make more sense of how css works
13:59  lukus: I'd rather only declare properties that are relevant to the design
13:59  riven: ... which is exactly the opposite of what a reset does, gg.
13:59  HappyPelican: Yeah, and I set some of those defaults, and I guess you'd call that my "reset", but it's only ever a couple of declarations. The big Eric Meyer ones assume that all those elements use all the default margins/paddings ... unless you had a site with just about every element, "border: 0; outline:0;padding:0;maring:0; ... etc" (which would look pretty boring), I don't see the point of those big resets
13:59  riven: incredible self-ownage there
13:59  riven: please don't ever talk again
13:59  lukus: ^ riven, in the code that I declare
14:00  lukus: I think HappyPelican is talking about integrating resets into the CSS he writes
14:00  HappyPelican: but anyway, the "css reset" debate is still .... I don't know ... weekly in here?
14:00  riven: no, he's talking about a *base* style sheet
14:01  lukus: riven, sometimes you come across as a passive-aggressive troll
14:01  riven: or better yet, s/style sheet/set of styles/
14:01  riven: lukus: sometimes you come across as a total retard
14:01  riven: s/sometimes/always/
14:01  lukus: <3
14:02  riven: Not your fault you were born that way of course, so no worries. It happens. Blame nature.
14:02  lukus: HappyPelican, yeah .. it's probably a matter of taste - I like declaring my IE6/7 code separately too .. riven was berating me for the other day too
14:03  lukus: s/the/that
14:03  HappyPelican: Everyone has an opinion on resets. I just wanted to explain why I don't use them, never need them, and don't recommend them. Maybe it comes down to coding style and I view them as a lazy way to code. "Reset everything so I don't have to worry about it later" is lazy imo, but hey, it probably saves the newbies a few browser inconsistencies.
14:03  riven: lukus: no, I admitted using condcoms is a valid alternative to in-css hacks - condcoms are just inferior
14:03  riven: CSs resets, on the other hand, are useless by definition
14:03  HappyPelican: I have a seperate IE6/7 style sheet if I need to fix more than half a dozen declarations ... again, just me
14:04  lukus: once I started using a resets script, my problems with IE6 were _greatly_ reduced
14:04  riven: lukus: and I also admitted that using a condcom to assign a class to html/body is a good approach, did I not?
14:04  HappyPelican: heh, lukus: i credit all I learned about IE6 inconsistencies by not magically solving them and hunting them down.
14:05  riven: lukus: no no, the reset style sheet appeared to fix those issues, because you simply don't know how to avoid those issues in the first place.
14:05  riven: Double fail.
14:05  HappyPelican: Conclusion: it's a matter of taste, as you said
14:05  lukus: yep.. I figure life's too short to be overly masochistic

15:37  padwan: ca doit marcher :)
15:37  jeffsmykil: is there a psuedo class for that
15:41  jeffsmykil: If i have a table and I want to style only the second TD
15:41  MACscr: then add a class to just the second td =P
15:42  jeffsmykil: hard if the code is being done programmatically
15:42  MACscr: not really
15:42  jeffsmykil: its an ASP data grid
15:42  jeffsmykil: i dont have that much control over individual grids
15:42  MACscr: can easily be done within a loop
15:42  jeffsmykil: i dont see the table code until after its generated
15:43  MACscr: well you might be able to something with js, but not with css
15:43  jeffsmykil: well I mean tr.alt td:nth-child(2)
15:43  jeffsmykil: gives me the second one
15:43  jeffsmykil: just in each tr
15:43  jeffsmykil: i only want the first tr
15:44  jeffsmykil: nothing for that?
15:47  jeffsmykil: in theory it would be like this
15:47  jeffsmykil: tr.alt:nth-child(2) td:nth-child(2)
15:48  macmartine: With sibiling div's within a parent, how would i make it so the 2nd child div is below the 1st child if there's room, but if the parent is too small or shrinks then it moves next to the first child?

16:37  jedimind: riven, not much; taking it easy for the holiday season

17:39  Aragon: ShawnRisk, when you change background: url(includes/images/arrow.png) no-repeat 5px 10px; the last two values you can adjust the image
17:39  Aragon: ShawnRisk, use firebug

17:53  muszek: hi... I have a table with a first column that looks something like <td><span></span>lorem ipsum</td> and another column that has a lot of text.  The <span> is an inline-block of a certain width (with a background image) and I'd like this first column to NOT be broken into two lines (but the long content of the other column makes it split into two lines).  How can I prevent it WITHOUT setting a fixed width of the first column?
17:54  chouchou: Aragon: pls are you ok with the violet colour i added? tell me what u thing so I can validate the rest

22:14  joseph: There's got to be a way to text-align: left in one cell and then text-align: center in the adjacent cell.
22:14  Itrace: In terms of SEO is there a reason not to do image replacement? I.E. setting the background image of a div to show my logo and applying a CSS rule of text-indent:-999em on the text so that only the image is shown.

22:38  ShawnRisk: seems no one is on
22:39  Tatsh: i fixed my problem with IE 8
22:39  Tatsh: if you hvae margin-top:-pixel value, expecting a div for example to be on top of another element, you have to use position:relative (IE7 does not require this)
22:42  TheoMurpse: If I have a SPAN inside a DIV, how do I make the SPAN 100% the height of the containing DIV? I tried setting the SPAN's height:100% but it doesn't change things at all.
22:43  jgornick: Is there a way I can specify an angled gradient in webkit?
22:43  TheoMurpse: height:inherit?
22:43  imsky: TheoMurpse: span must be display:block
22:44  TheoMurpse: imsky: Ah, OK, I was wondering if there was some prerequisite to use height:100%. Thank you.
22:44  imsky: np
22:45  TheoMurpse: OK, well then can I make the SPAN w/display:block only as wide as necessary to hold the text contained within? Now it takes up 100% width of the container element, which I don't want.
22:45  TheoMurpse: max-width or something exist?
22:46  TheoMurpse: Also, doing display:block and then float:left and height:100% makes it not 100% o the container element.
22:53  NoiseEee: so "last-child" and "nth-child" etc are determined when the DOM is rendered, and styles never change visually even if the DOM adds another child (ie: via JS)
22:53  NoiseEee: is that correct?
22:56  imsky: TheoMurpse: yes there are lots of problems with what you're doing
22:57  aaaa22222: does anyone know a better versioon of that of joomla
22:57  illio: I'm having a bit of css trouble.. If you look at https://www.aconiac.com/ the menu and content area look connected in Firefox, Chrome etc. However in IE7 the positioning fails so that the menu and the content is shifted downward and disconnected.. I can't seem to figure out why..
22:59  danmichel: aaaa22222 wordpress or drupal
23:00  oksushi: aaaa22222: what kind of Web site are you creating?
23:00  aaaa22222: why
23:00  oksushi: because that would give an indication as to which CMS you should use
23:01  NoiseEee: so "last-child" and "nth-child" etc are determined when the DOM is rendered, and styles never change visually even if the DOM adds another child (ie: via JS), correct?
23:02  oksushi: NoiseEee: no
23:03  NoiseEee: i'm finding that if a <li> for example is blue because the css for last-child specified it, and I add another <li> via the DOM, that the new last child is not blue, and the 2nd last child remains blue
23:03  TheoMurpse: imsky All I want is to have a DIV with a SPAN and DIV inside. The SPAN should be flush left and 100% the height of the containing DIV and only be some width, say, 20% the container. The other DIV should take up the other 80% or so of the space in the container div. How do I accomplish this?
23:04  imsky: TheoMurpse: why even use a SPAN?
23:04  TheoMurpse: <div><span style="display:block;height:100%">foo</span><div>bar</div>
23:04  oksushi: NoiseEee: url?
23:04  TheoMurpse: It could be a DIV, but I didn't think it made a diference once I made the span be display:block, so to avoid complicating matters, I just kept the act that it is a span consistent while seeking help. In that case,
23:04  TheoMurpse: <div><div style="display:block;height:100%">foo</span><div>bar</div>
23:04  TheoMurpse: How to improve upon that to make it work?
23:05  imsky: TheoMurpse: you don't need display:block on the div...anyway, float it left, give it a width, give the other div a margin-left of that same width
23:06  TheoMurpse: imsky: Is it possible to not give the DIV a width and have it only be as wide as necessary to encompass the text within?
23:06  TheoMurpse: (the left DIV I mean)
23:06  imsky: yes, you can just float it...

23:07  NoiseEee: oksushi: damn you are right, must be something else, thanks
23:08  TheoMurpse: OK. imsky Thanks. I need to learn teh difference between SPAN and DIV other than the obvious fact that one is block level and one is inline. Apparently there are CSS implications.
23:08  imsky: TheoMurpse: yep
23:11  TheoMurpse: I alwasy thought that a SPAN was exactly the same as a DIV display:inline and vice versa w/SPAN display:block. Thanks for the lesson!
23:15  TheoMurpse: imsky: I did what you said. I have <div><div style="float:left;height:100%;">foo</div><div>multi line text</div></div> but the floated DIV is still not 100%. It is only tall enough to contain "foo" and thn the multi-line DIV wraps around it.
23:15  imsky: oh yeah
23:15  imsky: floated divs don't expand to 100%
23:16  TheoMurpse: So how can I achieve both 100% height and a width that is only wide enough to contain the text within? Some sort o max-width:1px;overflow:display; or something? I forget how to use overlow...
23:16  imsky: google css columns
23:16  imsky: that's what you want ;)
23:16  imsky: oh yeah
23:16  imsky: not just that
23:16  imsky: google css columns full height
23:16  TheoMurpse: Yeah, that would have been the smart thing or me to search for. Yeesh, didn't even think of that.

23:50  Bartzy: Hi
23:50  Bartzy: I have a floated element
23:50  Bartzy: When I use float on it , the text inside doesn't expand the parent's element.. it seems like it's out of the flow
23:51  Bartzy: The text in the floated element is just flowing out of the boundaries of the element's parent.
23:51  Bartzy: How can I fix that ?
23:54  gnarf: Bartzy: clearfix the containing object maybe?
23:54  oksushi: Bartzy: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
23:54  Bartzy: gnarf: Clearfix ?
23:54  gnarf: http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.html
23:54  qq99: is there a good way to detect whether a browser supports position:fixed (as in the case of phones?)
23:55  qq99: maybe that's only some phones
23:55  gnarf: qq99: android doesn't support fixed
23:56  qq99: gnarf, yeah, I noticed that a couple days ago on mine
