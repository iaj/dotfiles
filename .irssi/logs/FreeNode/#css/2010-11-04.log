09:30  iaj: can I somehow reference to #id_foobar1 and #id_foobar2  with one #id_foobar* thingie?
09:32  oksushi: iaj: [id^="id_foobar"] {} http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-substrings
09:33  oksushi: CuDi: combined widths are greater than the available space? 
09:33  oksushi: there are many potential reasons
09:38  iaj: oksushi: thanks man :)
09:39  oksushi: no probs
09:49  CuDi: doesnt make sense though
09:49  CuDi: its text.. the text should just wraponto a new line
09:49  CuDi: its not like theres no spaces in the text
09:51  subhash:  pls help me out ---  here is the output ---  chrome out put -- http://pastehtml.com/view/1brshv0.html    -----  firefox output --- http://pastehtml.com/view/1brsi3w.html  -------  Internetexplorer output   ----- http://www.webdevout.net/test?05    ---the problem in internet explorer is the text in {legend span} is displaying in two lines

09:56  CuDi: sushi i gotta show you a screenshot
09:57  oksushi: subhash: which IE?
09:58  CuDi: http://iforce.co.nz/i/dpjccx0y.png
09:58  CuDi: plain text.
09:58  CuDi: no width set on any divs except the parent page container
09:58  xzcvczx: http://www.webdevout.net/test?06 <— as is sort of shown there with the red border, is there a way to "crop" or not show the bits that are outside of the border line? (only shown on left there)
09:59  xzcvczx: CuDi:  hows ihug treating you :P
09:59  CuDi: not bad man
09:59  CuDi: lol
10:00  xzcvczx: CuDi:  you akl?
10:00  oksushi: subhash: give legend span {} a width
10:00  subhash: okshushi:IE8
10:01  anli_: What is the counterpart of div in which you can set the width of the box?
10:01  oksushi: CuDi: sure the image is floated? is there a 'clear' on the text?
10:01  oksushi: provide the URL to the page CuDi
10:01  oksushi: xzcvczx: overflow: hidden;
10:02  oksushi: anli_: huh?
10:02  xzcvczx: oksushi:  ah, figured it would be something like that, thanks
10:02  CuDi: xzcvc yea auckland, oksushi: the image is floated, it is nested inside an <a> which is not
10:02  CuDi: i can't link the page cause it wont work for you but ill paste the entire html + css
10:03  oksushi: CuDi: without a url this is stabbing in the dark with a sausage. Provide the URL
10:03  CuDi: yea il paste the code
10:03  oksushi: or the URL to a testcase that displays the issue
10:03  oksushi: not a source code dump
10:03  anli_: oksushi: Is huh? a question? There is a question mark so maybe
10:03  oksushi: anli_: your question made no sense
10:03  oksushi: 'counterpart' to a div?
10:04  anli_: I want a div like element which I can set the width of, will you respond in the same way on that? :)
10:05  oksushi: use a div
10:05  oksushi: as you can give it a width.
10:05  anli_: I tried
10:05  CuDi: tada: test case: http://www.webdevout.net/test?029
10:05  anli_: Oh, wait
10:06  subhash: oksushi:  It rectified once i used &nbsp; for space .... if span is without spaces its working ... anyways now its fine thank you
10:06  anli_: My fault oksushi, did not press ctrl+s sufficiently distinct
10:06  CuDi: i'll be interested to hear what the cause is cause its baffled me
10:08  oksushi: CuDi: ok. Remove float from .item .main, .item .description
10:09  oksushi: and your doctype, and use of <b>, is an instant fail
10:09  CuDi: okay hangon
10:09  CuDi: lol real
10:09  oksushi: 4real, dawg
10:10  CuDi: lol i did that now what
10:10  oksushi: and srsly, use headings, paragraphs, and lists. You have just used div and span, which do not imbibe your html with any greater 'meaning'
10:10  CuDi: yea i know ill clear that up this is like a 10 minute job im just trying to do a proof of concept
10:11  CuDi: i removed the float left, but the #main still isnt floating to left
10:11  oksushi: CuDi: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02a&raw
10:11  oksushi: CuDi: it's just as easy to write proper html
10:12  oksushi: you like looking at half-naked guys, huh?
10:12  CuDi: lol no
10:12  CuDi: so in your webdevout link the only thing changed is ".item .img, .item .description { float:left; }" is removed?
10:12  oksushi: and from .item .main (like I said)
10:12  CuDi: oh
10:12  subhash: oksushi : how to common font size in all browsers?
10:13  oksushi: `g noodle incident sane typography @ subhash
10:13  rivvles: subhash: Google says "sane css typography - the noodle incident" • http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/typography/ • more results at http://goo.gl/gcUf3
10:13  CuDi: okay uploading again
10:14  CuDi: great works
10:14  CuDi: the final question with regard to that was, how can i get the "pic" img extend the entire height of the parent "item" div so all the content appears to the right of the "pic"
10:15  oksushi: give the content 'overflow: hidden'
10:15  CuDi: yea man just did that haha
10:15  CuDi: well .main
10:15  CuDi: awesome dude

11:53  gundas: is it possible to create a 2 column layout (sidebar fixed / content elastic) along with 100% height?
11:59  oksushi: like this? http://oksushi.com/test/2col/

12:08  emka: hello
12:09  emka: how i can remove white square, from the right in the foot http://www.electric-mind.ru
12:10  emka: throw the css ?
12:11  oksushi: emka: what white square?
12:11  emka: flash
12:12  oksushi: subhash: remove the white space between list items
12:12  oksushi: emka: remove the 'width' and 'height' attributes
12:13  emka: how can i set {width:0; height:0;} for this element?
12:13  gundas: oksushi: that's perfect but is there a way not having the main content scrollable within it's area and similar for the sidebar 
12:13  Shwaiil: hi ppl
12:13  Shwaiil: Q: Is it valid to place a <h1 <h2 .. type of tags inside <ul> ?
12:13  oksushi: gundas: not scrollable?
12:13  Shwaiil: Thanks =)
12:14  oksushi: Shwaiil: inside an <li> is fine, inside <ul> is not fine
12:14  Shwaiil: oksushi, thanks ;)
12:14  oksushi: ul can only have li as children
12:14  emka: oksushi, this element is included by skype javascript
12:14  emka: what i should to write ?
12:14  oksushi: edit it
12:15  emka: oksushi, maybe in css, i may set width:0, hegth:0 for object?
12:16  gundas: oksushi: Im trying to make it so i can put content in the main area (yellow) but it would be scrollable within that area - so it won't make the viewport scrollable just the div
12:17  emka: oksushi, may i set it in my css-file?
12:19  m_e: is there a way to define the :hover attribute as inline style? like <span style="color:white; (hover)color:black;" ...
12:20  riven: m_e: no

12:52  subhash: emka : i am unable to understand your prob ... i have seen the code there is a an object now what do you want to do ?
12:54  emka: i want to do a class like /* skype object {height:0;width:0;}
12:54  emka: and use it in the page 
12:54  emka: but if i set a blobal heigh=width=0 player will not work
12:55  subhash: emka,that has to be done by server coding .. i think .. what has css got to do here?
12:56  emka: in css i make object{height:0;width:0;} and there is no white square
12:56  emka: and player too)
12:56  emka: so i want to do only this white square invisible
12:56  Kingsy: riven - that doesnt seem to work (using overflow:hidden) on the container of the floats.. it just gets rid of the float... because its spilled outside of the container
12:57  subhash: make it hide
12:57  emka: how
12:57  subhash: emka:use hide  value
12:59  emka: look
12:59  emka: #page object {height: 0;width: 0;} works
12:59  emka: but my player is invisible
12:59  emka: and other flash, too

13:12  baubbelayponge: hello
13:12  johnathanb: HeLlO
13:13  baubbelayponge: could someone tell me why this code breaks in ie6 & ie7? http://jsfiddle.net/fZFYK/    apparently, the baseline isn't the same for these browsers.... thanks!
13:15  polilla: hello
13:16  polilla: i'm looking for a way to make a tbody element have a minimum height (even if it doesn't have any rows inside)
13:16  polilla: any clues?
13:37  ZombieLoffe: polilla, tbody needs rows to be valid :F
13:38  polilla: ZombieLoffe: what if i have a dynamic table (as in, a table i update through JS)
13:38  polilla: it may be empty, for instance
13:39  ZombieLoffe: then it'll collapse. AFAIK there's no way to have an empty table take up space.
13:40  baubbelayponge: k, guys, reduced the test case even more : http://jsfiddle.net/fZFYK/2/ . The question is, why does putting a margin on an inline-block have a different result in ie6/7? thanks
13:40  polilla: okay
13:40  polilla: thanks ZombieLoffe
13:41  polilla: baubbelayponge: i don't think ie6 supports inline-block
13:41  baubbelayponge: it does, on inline elements
13:42  sriley: its kinda buggy but it treats inline elements that have layout the same as inline-block, try *display:inline;*zoom:1;
13:45  baubbelayponge: well, yep, same result. applies the margin when it shouldn't :/
13:48  sriley: well a vertical-align:top will fix it
13:48  sriley: or bottom
13:49  sriley: or really anything other than baseline
14:50  Lindrian: oi
14:51  Lindrian: I have a funny bug here
14:51  Lindrian: in ie7, I get a massive scrollbar at the bottom
14:51  Lindrian: even though there shoudnt be one
14:51  Lindrian: its not massive, but it scrolls beyond the site width by like 500px, when it shoudnt
14:51  Lindrian: if the window is smaller than the site the scroll bar is correct
14:51  Lindrian: otherwise its wrong
14:51  Lindrian: works fine in ff though
14:52  Lindrian: I have tried html { width: 100%; and overflow-x: hidden; } and similar, which works, but removes the scroll bar entirely -- even if its needed
14:52  Lindrian: do you have any solution?
14:52  acr0nym: it could be anything, do you have an example page?
14:53  acr0nym: also.. are you using reset css/stylesheet
14:54  Lindrian: I am not resetting default things css, no.
14:54  Lindrian: I have one but I don't want to publish it to everyone
14:54  Lindrian: perhaps pm?
14:55  Lindrian: (even with resetting everything the scrollbar presists)
14:59  acr0nym: was away, pm is alright
15:11  mekwall: Lindrian, did you solve it?
15:13  mekwall: Lindrian, could be this: http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/12/28/bug-ie7-absolutely-positioned-italics/
15:19  xckpd7: question for anyone: can anyone explain why I can't relatively position something over a select element? This simple piece of code works for every browser but IE6: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02j&raw
15:23  mekwall: xckpd7, http://www.brainjar.com/css/positioning/default5.asp
15:24  mekwall: xckpd7, pretty sure 5.5 and 6 handle it the same way
15:25  xckpd7: mekwall: your help is appreciated :)
15:26  mekwall: xckpd7, not really helping since there's no solution to the problem :)
15:26  mekwall: xckpd7, but there's a reason why Google abandoned support for IE6 some time ago
15:26  mekwall: everyone else should do the same :P
15:27  xckpd7: We cater solely to Corporate types... we develop cool new features for new browsers, but we still need to support ie6 in some capacity... the fix for this will literally be to not overlap labels for IE6
15:30  iaj: lo there
15:30  mekwall: xckpd7, it's not a fix :) it's just avoiding bumping into the problem hehe
15:30  iaj: when I use visibilty: hidden;   how can I avoid the space its using anyway?
15:31  mekwall: iaj, by not using it... use display: none
15:31  iaj: but I can still access the values then?
15:31  iaj: (they are being used for a form)
15:32  iaj: mekwall: thanks
15:33  Azrael_-: hi
15:35  Azrael_-: i set "width: 98%" to <input type="text"> using css. in ie8/ff everything is fine. in ie7 the box is reduced to about 10px width for no reason. any idea why?
15:35  mekwall: iaj, np. just a tip: to avoid us getting irritated, please refrain from asking follow-up questions before trying the previous solution ;)
15:35  xckpd7: mekwall: well we're both right: a bug was filed for that occurence, and basec on our philosophy for how development for browsers should go, anything that isn't representative of the core of the application that takes any good amount of time to fix gets nixed for IE6
15:36  xckpd7: mekwall: what I'm more interested in, is exactly what happens when you have something like a jQuery modal on the page and the select is on the page... 
15:36  xckpd7: is that the exception?
15:37  xckpd7: well anyway that
15:37  xckpd7: 's a question for another room

16:29  riven: wut
16:30  johnathanb: Ask in #css-lance them guys are funny
16:31  iateadonut: a float:left div is moving below a float:right div when the contents cause the div to stretch to take up the whole screen.
16:31  jerryluc: if i have a internal href="test", I don't want it to be visible if it's not push(activated). example.com/#test
16:31  iateadonut: how do i get a float:left div to not take up any particular width:%, but to use 100% of the room that is left after the float:right div is displayed?
16:32  riven: jerryluc: but how can you push something if it isn't visible?
16:32  riven: iateadonut: don't float it

16:44  kW_: Hello! Does anybody know a tool to convert a CSS-enabled HTML page into a non-CSS HTML page (e.g. to be consumable by old HTML parser which do not support CSS)?
16:44  iateadonut: thanks.
16:45  kW_: That is: text sections which are coloured differently should use a "<FONT COLOR="#...">" tag, etc.
16:45  FireSlash: kW_, out of sick curiousity, what browser are you trying to support
16:45  JDigital: I'm guessing e-mail. Even Commodore Amiga has a proper browser now.
16:45  iaj: how can I have an input type="text" field not be editable?
16:45  FireSlash: Even email clients support CSS though
16:46  FireSlash: iaj, google "html input readonly"
16:47  BW^-: i want a div, in which i have two divs: the first, a right-aligned dropdown, and the second, a text input that takes up 100% of the div's space, that the dropdown didn't take up.
16:47  BW^-: how do i do this?
16:47  xzcvczx: JDigital:  even "commodore amigas" browser beats ie :P
16:49  kW_: FireSlash: actually, I want to import syntax-highlighted code into an OpenOffice document
16:50  jerryluc: riven: http://fedoraproject.org/en/features/ uses internal href's in their menu, but with no :target in their css files. Do you understand how they do it?
16:50  JDigital: xzcvczx: It does, Origyn for Amiga uses WebKit
16:50  kW_: but openoffice does not support CSS
16:50  sriley: jerryluc: via js
16:51  JDigital: kW_: Maybe export it as PDF or RTF, or maybe there's a browser that lets you copypaste into Wordpad and retain colour formatting
16:51  FireSlash: kW_, you can copy the highlighted text from browsers like firefox (tested) into openoffice and it will remember the coloring
16:52  FireSlash: fonts as well
16:52  FireSlash: Just texted with FF4 and OO 3.1
16:52  FireSlash: tested even
16:54  kW_: FireSlash: weird, I've just tried this using mozilla seamonkey (firefox-based browser) and OO 3.1 on linux and failed (the links, however, are imported correctly)
16:55  FireSlash: kW_, I notice some sites don't work well for this (pastebin.com for example). Seems firefox doesn't copy the formatting well, or OO doesn't import it well.
16:55  kW_: FireSlash: I think the latter
16:55  FireSlash: I had no issues with http://tohtml.com/ though
16:55  kW_: FireSlash: I think it depends on which code highlighter is used
16:55  FireSlash: Just make sure you copy from the preview
16:56  FireSlash: For longer sections you might need a different site. I think its the line numbering that confuse OO
16:56  kW_: FireSlash: http://tohtml.com/ works, weird.

17:16  geoid: also find this element:
17:16  geoid: <div class="myClass yourClass">
17:17  oodavid: anyone know if you can save your console messages between pages (chrome, firefox, whatever)
17:19  oodavid: geod: all you need is $ ("div.myClass")
17:19  oodavid: also, you have an extra opening parenthesis
17:21  iateadonut: text-align doesn't work with overflow hidden?
17:21  oodavid: iateadonut: ask that in #css
17:21  Accelerator: oodavid, This is #css ..?
17:21  oodavid: bahahhaaaa
17:22  oodavid: I thought was in jQuery
17:22  oodavid: gawdammit
17:22  Accelerator: lol, fail :P
17:22  riven: oodavid: firebug's console has a 'persist' button in the toolbar..
17:22  oodavid: megafail
17:22  oodavid: riven: legendary
17:22  riven: kinda hard to miss ;o
17:22  Accelerator: Can I reiterate is anyone here has an answer to my question though? (Posted above)
17:23  riven: Wow, impressive use of the English language there.
17:23  oodavid: Accelerator: a combined background: rule will override any singular ones
17:24  geoid: oodavid damn that was funny
17:24  Accelerator: oodavid, Where is it combined? I figured something in the HTML file was overriding it, but I don't see were. Meh
17:25  geoid: pls don't dis
17:25  geoid: my parenthesis
17:25  geoid: :P
17:26  oodavid: Accelerator: your html is garbled
17:26  Accelerator: oodavid, how so? :3
17:26  oodavid: closing </form> <paypal> isn't a tag
17:27  riven: lal.
17:27  Accelerator: I removed the PayPal form tag, I don't know why I did though.
17:27  Accelerator: It's normally an actuall form though, lol.
17:27  oodavid: Accelerator: http://jsfiddle.net/oodavid/Xgttb/ < works for me
17:28  oodavid: I'm gonna leave before I die of wrong channel shame
17:36  Accelerator: oodavid, It's @font-face that's overriding it.
17:36  Accelerator: Any idea why?
17:40  Accelerator: So basically, @font-face is nullifying body { background-color:#001111; } when it is properly linked to src: url("./Abscissa.ttf");
17:41  tw2113: Accelerator, the "./Abscissa.ttf" is referring to the same directory
17:41  tw2113: if you're trying to move up a directory, it's ..
17:41  Accelerator: tw2113, I know. When oodavid was using jfiddle, it obviously wouldn't link to the .ttf file, so it appeared fine there.
17:42  tw2113: ah
17:42  tw2113: just mentioning and hoping to help :D
17:42  Accelerator: Heheh. thanks :p
17:42  Accelerator: and he poofs.
17:43  BW^-: any idea how max TEXT INPUT take 100% of space remaining after a span with a text and a dropdown in it has taken its space to the right?
17:45  BW^-: bbl
17:50  Juandev: hi
17:50  Juandev: li is a block or inline element?
17:51  Juandev: I would guess its block
17:52  Tweakin: block by default, yes
