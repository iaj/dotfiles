00:02  kithpom: tw2113: I'm trying to recreate html style border shadowing
00:02  iaj: mhh, http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46 theres just 2 divs with floating: lefts.. can someone tell me where that large space on the left is coming from
00:02  tw2113: tables aren't worth too much effort for shadows imho
00:07  Vaerros: anyone observed br elements having default widths, at least in gecko?
00:21  DaBeast^: hi guys
00:22  DaBeast^: any help with my problem?
00:22  DaBeast^: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02b
00:22  DaBeast^: was developping this site, was in px first, but decited to convert to % because its gonna have a gallery
00:23  amh345: i have a quick question.  <div id="click_me> click<div id="container">stuff</div></div>    im trying to get click me to overlay on the container div.  i've set #click_me style to z-index:9999 and pos:rel but it still sits above #container of it.
00:23  DaBeast^: but when resizing the window, the content dev jumps below the menu div
00:23  joelklabo: If I wanted to put a button and a text field horizontally next to each other I should float: left/right? I've reduced the widths and the button keeps getting pushed down
00:24  oksushi: DaBeast^: you have not allocated enough space for the combined widths of the items, so it 'falls under' the floated element
00:24  oksushi: joelklabo: sure
00:24  DaBeast^: oksushi: so.. how would i fix this?
00:24  oksushi: amh345: because it is the parent
00:25  amh345: oksushi: i tried it as a child and it would work either.
00:25  DaBeast^: amh345: well, have you set the float?
00:25  amh345: DaBeast^: float on #click_me?
00:25  oksushi: DaBeast^: allocate more space or reduce the width ot make sure that the combined widths never exceed 100%
00:25  joelklabo: aksushi: i reduced the widths, still same thing....
00:25  bfred: can anyone please remind me why we use image replacement rather than, say, use and img with an alt attribute? :| my mind just went blank
00:26  oksushi: amh345: http://oksushi.com/test/hover-image-captions.html has something similar
00:26  bfred: *using an img
00:26  oksushi: bfred: so 'view source' on the page displays text
00:26  amh345: oksushi, thank. ill check that source.  it shouldnt make a difference if there's a swf in side the parent div, should it?
00:27  oksushi: amh345: depends on the wmode you set
00:27  oksushi: how are you placin the swf object?
00:27  bfred: oksushi: my face now: http://d.pr/im8Y
00:28  DaBeast^: but oksushi, normally 80% + 15% will never be 100% ?
00:30  oksushi: DaBeast^: you have set width AND padding AND border
00:30  bfred: DaBeast^: it may in webkit-based browsers
00:30  bfred: </sarcasm>
00:30  oksushi: ]css box model @ DaBeast^
00:30  _ZofBot4: DaBeast^, CSS Box Model: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/box.html | http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/box-model.html | http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm
00:31  oksushi: you will often run into trouble when you combined percentages and fixed widths
00:35  DaBeast^: oksushi: yes, but the jumping is not in IE only, also in firefox and chrome
00:35  oksushi: …
00:35  DaBeast^: also i used a css resetter
00:35  oksushi: did I mention IE?
00:36  oksushi: and you still do not understand the box model
00:36  DaBeast^: http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm did :p
00:36  oksushi: actual width = width PLUS padding PLUS border
00:36  oksushi: so you have 80% + horizontal padding + 2px of border
00:36  oksushi: which is greater than 80%. See?
00:37  DaBeast^: aha, yes
00:39  DaBeast^: at 75% it jumps then squashed realy tight, so i guess its fine enough
00:39  DaBeast^: when*
00:39  oksushi: DaBeast^: remove the padding and border and put it on an internal element
00:40  DaBeast^: you mean like a paragraph class?
00:40  oksushi: DaBeast^: or another div inside the two 'columns'
00:41  DaBeast^: k, let me try that
00:41  DaBeast^: thanks man
00:43  iaj: hmmm, can someone mb help me... the box on the right.. on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46 any clue why it is looking so weird on ie?
00:44  oksushi: iaj: did you fix your code yet?

00:45  DaBeast^: oksushi: changing the padding to % aswell seems to work pretty good too
00:47  iaj: oksushi: the code is generated by typo so I can't easily change the DOCTYPE.. which errors were you refering to?

00:57  linuxviewer: I have a <P> that is not definied class but is within 3 div's.  I tried to specify the third (most relevant) div as such "divname3 p { attributes ;}" but it doesnt work.  If I do it like this "divname1 divname2 divname3 p { attributes ;}" it works.  I don't want to always go that deep.  Any suggestions?
00:57  linuxviewer: That deep in the CSS, it seems like a lot of repeating code
00:59  linuxviewer: It is actually ".divname3"   should it be #divname3 ?
01:02  oksushi: is it a class or an ID?

02:32  linuxviewer: my issue is related to nested selectors
02:32  moshee: put !important next to the color property for your DIV_NAME P?
02:33  obert-: div name?:)
02:33  linuxviewer: moshee = i dont understand what you mean.  My issue is that the divname is "column_right" and I have some selections within that DIV
02:33  linuxviewer: and then the P within the DIV will not change color
02:33  linuxviewer: it is always staying what the DIV css says
02:33  oksushi: linuxviewer: please use correct terminology
02:33  linuxviewer: rather than the colum_right p
02:33  oksushi: there is no 'divname'

02:55  oksushi: aurilliance: you’re at UQ?
03:00  kappaluppa: I've been reading a lot about ie and more than 31 stylesheets, and link vs import and the max lines per stylesheet linked being 4059. Is this line limit a case for constructing styles on all one line rather than have each part of a class, say, on a separate line?
03:00  kappaluppa: is the line limit actual numbers of lines in code?
03:01  kappaluppa: i can make .titleclass {font-size:14px; color:#990000; float:left; width:400px;} be on one line or 6, as is typical
03:02  aurilliance: oksushi, yeah I am - yourself?
03:02  oksushi: aurilliance: I was :)
03:02  obert-: kappaluppa that's just optimization
03:03  aurilliance: oksushi, what studying?
03:03  kappaluppa: obert, right. that's what I'm researching
03:03  aurilliance: btw my blog should say 3rd year now ;)
03:03  oksushi: aurilliance: bachelor of science (computer science)
03:03  oksushi: ah
03:03  aurilliance: Nice
03:03  oksushi: well, i finished a long time ago now :P
03:03  kappaluppa: we have a site with about 45 stylesheets. and trying to optimize it
03:03  oksushi: kappaluppa: then you’re Doing It Wrong
03:03  obert-: kappaluppa 6 lines of code arent readable if minified
03:03  kappaluppa: how so
03:04  oksushi: most likely using Drupal or something :P
03:04  kappaluppa: yep, drupal
03:04 * oksushi guesses
03:04  moshee: lol
03:04  oksushi: kaching!
03:04  aurilliance: :P
03:04 * oksushi gives oksushi a cookie
03:05  kappaluppa: obert, what do you mean 6 lines of code aren't readable if minified - this is what I'm trying to educate myself about
03:05  ZombieLoffe: 45 stylesheets o.o
03:05  aurilliance: kappaluppa, go ahead an minify - just make sure you keep non-minified copies
03:06  aurilliance: ZombieLoffe, Joomla templates are often the same
03:06  kappaluppa: we are using an optimizer currenlty
03:06  ZombieLoffe: Dreadful
03:06  oksushi: Dreadful Drufail
03:06  kappaluppa: we actually *only* have 24 stylesheets in our theme, the modules we are using add the rest
03:06  oksushi: is what he was called at CMS school
03:07  kappaluppa: we are using an optimizer, but for ongoing development don't like the turn it on/turn it off process we have to go through all the time
03:08  kappaluppa: so we're considering combining several to reduce the number of stylesheets
03:08  kappaluppa: but then don't want to run into the max lines limit that IE has
03:09  oksushi: how about choosing a better cms?
03:10  kappaluppa: so this is where my question regarding how number of lines are calculated in regards to the limit
03:10  oksushi: if not, change the way your theme uses css files. Put it all into one file.
03:10  oksushi: and if you hav that much css, you are seriously doing something wrong
03:10  kappaluppa: often you see styles broken down with each item on one line
03:11  kappaluppa: but sometimes you can combine onto one line. this client has actually requested things line by line.
03:11  kappaluppa: so I'm wondering if in my example it counts as six lines or one because it is one class
03:12  kappaluppa: well, oksushi, i don't have the option of changing how they have everything set up, so I have to try to make the best I can of it...
03:12  kappaluppa: this is what I'm trying to do
03:12  oksushi: line numbers are not related to the structure, but to the number of lines
03:12  dravekx: any photoshop experts here?
03:12  oksushi: dravekx: ask elsewhere
03:12  oksushi: like ##photoshop
03:12  dravekx: ...
03:13  oksushi: or ##design
03:13  dravekx: have you tried to join that channel?
03:13  kappaluppa: so in my example: (7:01:42 PM) kappaluppa: i can make .titleclass {font-size:14px; color:#990000; float:left; width:400px;} be on one line or 6, as is typical
03:13  kappaluppa: that would be considered 6 lines if everythign on one line
03:13  oksushi: kappaluppa: if the text is on one line, it is one line
03:13  dravekx: cool. thx ok
03:13  kappaluppa: thanks!
03:13  kappaluppa: thats all i wanted to know
03:14  kappaluppa: this is a case for not breaking things up so much, giving us more lines to use for combined files
03:17  dravekx: sob. I hate it when nobody answers.

03:36  zhenia: How to set site height to be always 1024px?
03:36  oksushi: why make something so inflexible?
03:38  zhenia: Lack of knowledge to make it in proper way.
03:38  oksushi: ok. Why not learn how to design properly? opera.com/wsc has some great 'beginner' tutorials
03:39  zhenia: What's the big problem with fixed height?
03:39  oksushi: what happens if someone has a browser window more than 1024px? Less? What about handheld devices?
03:39  oksushi: etc etc
03:40 --- Curt` is now known as curt`off
03:41  zhenia: Hmm more than 1024px. That's the only issue
03:47  zhenia: Would min-height be OK?

03:50  NiLon: without tables, this is what I would wanna have http://www.webdevout.net/test?02c but I'm having this http://www.webdevout.net/test?02d, so any neat trick to get those boxes on empty cap?
03:52  oksushi: NiLon: clear: left; on the sixth box
03:52  oksushi: NiLon: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02e&raw
03:54  NiLon: oksushi problem is that I don't know what block is "sixth" because it requires browser to render that view
03:55  NiLon: I wanna those blocks to go smallest possible space depending width of container (= width of browser window)
03:55  oksushi: then you can set a fixed height, or you can wrap each 'row' in a container
03:55  oksushi: or use some tool like http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry/
03:59  NiLon: I would not wanna use fixed height because sometimes content is a bit too large but most of time it isn't
04:00  NiLon: that masonry looks good
04:00  NiLon: I think I will go with it

Setting it's height to 100% almost works except that doesn't take away the fixed child-div's height away from the parent div's height. What should I do?
12:21  stickDeath: kzar: i think this may help you http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/examples/csslayout1.html

12:33  kzar: stickDeath: I need to say "height: 100% -30px" if that makes sense

14:00  [eXception]: hi guys
14:00  [eXception]: i have a container like this: <div style="height:200px;overflow:hidden"><p>abc...</p></div>
14:01  [eXception]: now: when the text in <p> grows too large it gets cropped... thats what I want
14:01  [eXception]: but if the fnt is too large too, it gets cropped in the middle of the letters... an thats looks bad... how can I solve this problem?
14:02  [eXception]: It should get cropped right after the line-end (like in a textarea)
14:03  ZombieLoffe: [eXception], make the height a divisble of the line-height
14:03  ZombieLoffe: eg. if line-height is 16px, make the height 32px
14:03  ZombieLoffe: you could also do it with relative units, eg. font-size: 3em; line-height: 3em; height: 3em;
14:03  ZombieLoffe: Er, line-height: 1em;* in the previous example.
14:06  Absolute0: My div that surrounds two blocks that float left and right seems to shrink to a single pixel while the floating elements remain the same. How can I make a surrounding div surround floating divs?
14:06  ZombieLoffe: Absolute0: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
14:07  Absolute0: thanks
14:08  [eXception]: thx <ZombieLoffe>
14:08  [eXception]: is there a Html-way to get text wrapped instead of cropped?
14:09  ZombieLoffe: [eXception]: Eh.. don't set a height?
14:09  [eXception]: y:)
14:09  [eXception]: yeah, but I want it to get wrapped and make the rest hidden
14:10  [eXception]: in a textarea it works like that
14:10  ZombieLoffe: not sure how you mean
14:11  [eXception]: f.e. you can set a textarea height and the text will wrap at  a line end
14:14  samtuke: My tables are exceeding page width and ignoring width and max width rules, I can't figure out why or how to fix it. Ideas?: http://fsfe.sny.no/campaigns/pdfreaders/buglist.en.html
14:20  ZombieLoffe: samtuke, afaik, you can't. I don't know of any way, at least.
14:20  ZombieLoffe: tables do whatever they want.
14:21  James13433: I need to float 2, 3 or 4 li's within a ul depending on the content, but I need the containin ul to be the same no larger or smaller than the 3 li's together, how could I do that?
14:21  ZombieLoffe: [eXception]: Like I said, make the height of the element evenly divisble by line-height...
14:21  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: so I should turn them all into divs?
14:23  ZombieLoffe: [eXception]: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0k
14:23  ZombieLoffe: samtuke: No, you should make more space so the table data fits :3
14:23  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: if you've seen the page, you'll realise that this is hard due to the quantity of data and fixed page width
14:23  samtuke: can anyone confirm that tables often don't obey css widths in modern browsers
14:24  ZombieLoffe: samtuke, what do you _want_ to happen?
14:24  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: the tables to be the same width as the #content area, and adjust col widths automatically to fit
14:24  ZombieLoffe: samtuke, and if there's not enough room in a column?
14:25  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: then auto adjust the table cols to 1 char wide if necessary
14:25  ZombieLoffe: that would make the data completely unreadable
14:26  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: yes it would, but it would obey the rules of the page, and it would be a point to work from. Currently much of the data is unreadable anyway because it extends past the visible area (I set overflow to invisible intentionally)
14:26  ZombieLoffe: samtuke, the only solution I can think of would be to add a <div> to each <td>, set a max-width on the div, and set word-wrap: break-word;
14:28  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: why use tables at all in that case, why not replace them entirely with divs?
14:28  ZombieLoffe: samtuke, because that would make it even more unreadable, heh
14:29  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: why, I could just style the divs to behave like tables, except fix the bug that they don't obey styling rules in the process, couldn't I?
14:29  ZombieLoffe: tabular data needs to make sense even with styles disabled
14:29  ZombieLoffe: besides, getting it to behave as a table using only divs would be a nightmare -- especially if you want it to work cross-browser.
14:29  samtuke: ZombieLoffe: hmm, good point
14:30  samtuke: x2
14:32  ZombieLoffe: samtuke: Actually, it might even be easier than that... try setting table-layout: fixed; and a width in pixels on the <table>
14:34  ZombieLoffe: samtuke: Oh, and word-wrap: break-word; unless you want the text to overflow instead of break
14:34  ZombieLoffe: Er, if you want the text to break rather than overflow*

14:41  domcat: hi guys, I have 2 column layout -> sidebar/content, no wrapper width set, only margin. In content I have an image that should resize dynamically depending on the browser width, so I set its width as 100% and added max/min widths/heights, however when I make the window too small it jumps under the sidebar. I want it to stay on its place in its min size, any ideas how to achieve it?
14:42  guest_: Question to everyone
14:43  ZombieLoffe: domcat: you want a horizontal scrollbar to appear when the window is too small?
14:43  guest_: is there a good channel, to find out why sometimes my site doesnt load? its a .com address, and i was told that, the problem was due to that
14:43  domcat: ZombieLoffe: ideally it should imitate this flash behaviour http://beyoustill.com/#/new%20work/just%20be/1
14:43  domcat: except there is min width/height on the image
14:44  ZombieLoffe: Well yeah, that's the point -- you want a horizontal scrollbar to appear when the min width is exceeded (or.. deceeded, whatever)
14:44  ZombieLoffe: yes?
14:45  domcat: yes, it could work this way
14:46  ZombieLoffe: domcat: iirc the only way to achieve that is to wrap both containers in a div and give that div width: [left column width] + [minimum width of image];
14:47  Clorith: overflow: scroll ?
14:47  domcat: when I add width to the wrapper then it not resizes at all, but now I tried to apply min-width to the wrapper and it seems to work
14:48  ZombieLoffe: actually my suggestion made no sense, ignore that
14:48  ZombieLoffe: heh
14:48  ZombieLoffe: Yeah, you're right, min-width on the wrapper is more appropriate
14:51  domcat: now the challenge will be those browsers which doesnt support min/max-es :p
14:52  ZombieLoffe: there are JS fixes implementing it for IE
14:52  domcat: ZombieLoffe: also what do you think, it is possible to center that layout? now as I dont have a width there I cant use margin: 0 auto
14:52  domcat: on the wrapper
14:53  ZombieLoffe: text-align: center; would center the image...
14:54  MACscr: ok, so when dealing with dynanic data and wanting to have more margin above h2's for example and the paragraph above it, is there anything i can do about when an h2 happens and there is no paragraph above it? Aka, sometimes its at the beginning of the page (the page title, h1, is in separate place on the page design). Hope im making sense
14:55  domcat: in this case it works a bit different I think
14:56  domcat: never mind, display:block and margin: 0 auto on image did it

18:14  Tempus2: Not sure where to ask, but if I want a fixed width on my website, how narrow should it be?
18:14  dravekx: narrow?
18:14  Tempus2: width
18:15  ZombieLoffe: Tempus2, there's no definite answer, but many choose 960px -- it fitso n 1024x768 resolution and is easily divisible by a whole lot of numbers.
18:15  dravekx: I usually set mine around 994px
18:16  Tempus2: I ran my website at work, and it doesn't fit on their screens because they run resolutions from the 90's sicne my co-workers run 4:3 screens with 1024 x 768 resolution
18:16  Tempus2: Mostly because they are so old they need glasses to see anything near enough they'd smell their own sweat
18:17  dravekx: 960px tends to be a standard, but I like it a little bigger due to recent widescreen lcds.
18:17  Tempus2: Yes, mine looks narrow on a widescreen heh
18:17  Tempus2: The main portion has a with of 50em 16pt
18:17  Tempus2: width*
18:18  Tempus2: But since it's centered, the extra stuff I added falls partially outside the screen
18:19  ZombieLoffe: So reduce it until it fits on 1024
18:20  Tempus2: Well making the main portion any narrower makes the articles I have, since they're divided into several colums, so narrow it wouldn't be good
18:20  Tempus2: But anyway, thanks for the answer. Think I am going to head the script way
18:20  Tempus2: Placing the page all to the left if viewport is too narrow
18:21  Tempus2: There are way too many resolutions these days, it is hard to make something organized for any resolution
18:23  ZombieLoffe: I browse in widescreen on 1680x1050, I find 960~ width websites look fine. The empty space on the sides doesn't look bad.
18:23  ZombieLoffe: Inefficient, sure, but it's manageable
18:24  johnline: http://johnline.bastage.net/flamingo/cgt.html
18:24  johnline: i maded template woeo
18:25  Tempus2: Yes, I've made that sort of page before. If you have a lot of floating content, it would be easy
18:26  Tempus2: Images is one of the easiest
18:28  Tempus2: Another question: Would it be hard making this image into CSS?: http://bcreativewilde.com/images/calendar_legend.gif
18:28  dravekx: no
18:29  Tempus2: how would I make the split box?
18:29  dravekx: ?
18:29  Tempus2: there's a little split box in the legend
18:29  Tempus2: "Days with events"
18:30  dravekx: simple image
18:30  johnline: 2 divs?
18:30  Tempus2: I wanted to make it CSS too, so if the color-theme changes, those colors change too
18:31  Tempus2: Hum... gonna be a pretty split up box heh
18:31  Tempus2: <div><div><div></div><div></div></div></div> :P
18:32  dravekx: rofl.
18:32  johnline: splitboxa{width:10px;height:5px;background-color:#ccc;}splitboxb{width:10px;height:5px;background-color:#aaa;}
18:32  Tempus2: But better than an image
18:32  Tempus2: Yeah sure john,. I'll give it a try heh
18:32  Tempus2: Thanks
18:33  dravekx: or a list would work. either or.
18:34  Tempus2: Bah, a list for 2 boxes would be a waste of time in this case
18:35  dravekx: ... it all depends on what you are trying to accomplish
18:35  Tempus2: But I use lists when there are like 4 or more logicially placed boxes
18:35  dravekx: like i said.
18:36  Tempus2: a div is closer and has more properties in common with what I want than a list in this example I think
18:36  johnline: you could make 'days with events' blue on the calendar :p
18:36  Tempus2: Speaking of which...
18:36  Tempus2: Can't CSS elements inherit properties from other elements now?
18:37  Tempus2: other CSS elements
18:37  Tempus2: That is not children I mean
18:37  Tempus2: Or is my memory frail?
18:38  Tempus2: Anyway, let's make that box first
18:40  johnline: i think you have to to it with js getstyle
18:40  johnline: to to to
18:50  Tempus2: that might be
18:59  MasterCSSGuru: Hi
18:59  MasterCSSGuru: How can I prevent a div from overflowing its parent?
18:59  dravekx: talk about Irony
19:00  MasterCSSGuru: :D
19:00  MasterCSSGuru: I want need to prevent its width from overflowing the parent when the text is too long. width: 100% and word-wrap: break-word aren't doing it
19:02  MasterCSSGuru: The parent's width is set to match the width of the browser (display: block). One way to prevent overflowing in the width is to set the width explicitly. Is there another way?
19:03  MasterCSSGuru: dravekx: My real nickname is MasterCSSGuruInTraining, but that's too long for IRC.
19:03  MasterCSSGuru: So, any way around doing this in Javascript (setting the width explicitly according to browser width)?
19:06  Tempus2: obj.style = "CSS HERE";
19:07  Tempus2: eg document.getElementById("My_obj").style = "width: 50em";
19:09  Tempus2: And it won't b e explicitly otherwise
19:10  Tempus2: If you want a dynamic width, you need to either use a timer, or onchange event-handler that gets browser view-port and set the width accordingly, but that won't be explicit
19:11  Tempus2: BUt that's a task fittet for the javascript channel
19:11  jones-: Hello. I want to have 3 li's in a horizontal line, so that the first one is left aligned, the middle one is centered, and 3rd one is right aligned. I have put them with display:inline, the first 2 float left and the 3rd floats right, and they all have width:33%. But IE screws something up. Can somebody check it out at http://astrobin.com/1 ?
19:11  jones-: I'm taliing about those things right on top of the big photo.
19:12  jones-: talking*
19:14  Tempus2: That they don't show the rounded pictures on each side?
19:14  mavingaye: jones-: what version ie? 6?
19:15  dravekx: ie5.5 > all
19:16  mavingaye: i like your page btw
19:17  Tempus2: I make my pages compatible with IE3
19:17  Tempus2: so it's all tables! ALL TABLES I SAY!
19:17  Godslastering: how does one get the browser window height with css?
19:17  dravekx: I'm using css5
19:17  Tempus2: css5?
19:18  Tempus2: He's from the future!
19:18  dravekx: i skipped 3 and 4 to get out all the bugs faster.
19:18  dravekx: so far it's compatible with everything, including my ex girlfriends.
19:19  Tempus2: jones-: wake up
19:19  jones-: Sorry guys.
19:19  jones-: IE 7.
19:19  jones-: mavingaye, Tempus2, ^
19:20  jones-: Tempus2: no, it's not about the rounded corners. It's about the orange-reddish background of the ul's taking all 33% of the space, while they just fit the content in firefox and chrome.
19:21  Tempus2: That's because an UL is a block element
19:21  Tempus2: Have you specified the width of the UL?
19:22  Tempus2: Think you need to explicitly set the with of the UL if you want to make that fit.
19:22  Tempus2: Or the width of the parent
19:22  Tempus2: Not a percentage
19:22  jones-: Tempus2: no, it's the li that's 33%
19:23  Tempus2: Yes...
19:23  Tempus2: I understand that...
19:23  jones-: You mean each of those li's a different width?
19:23  Tempus2: And li is a child of UL
19:23  Tempus2: Not they're the same width if you don't specify so
19:23  jones-: So it's an accident that it renders as I mean it in Firefox and Chrome?
19:24  Tempus2: Well I don't know that much about CSS which is right and wrong in this case, but specifying doesn't make it display any different in FF or Chrome
19:24  Tempus2: It will still be the same width
19:25  Tempus2: I haven't looked at your stylesheet
19:25  Tempus2: But li that are siblings within the same UL are the same width by default in most browsers
19:25  Tempus2: a li = block by default
19:26  jones-: See, if I remove the width, then the 3rd li will float right, and the problem is only the cetran one, the voting stars. It will be left aligned next to the first li.
19:27  Tempus2: look at my menu then, it has holders on both sides, although bugged in Opera somewhat, but I will fix it
19:27  Tempus2: It is a li that has holders on both sides and it's fixed
19:28  Tempus2: http://bcreativewilde.com/events.php
19:28  Tempus2: The menu below the header
19:29  Tempus2: in stylesheet the elements in that part starts with "#top_menu"
19:30  Tempus2: And it's encased in the main portion of the page called #page
19:32  Tempus2: Since the UL width is auto I mean, it inherit the #page width
19:34  jones-: brb
19:35  daviddoria: on this page from an example http://daviddoria.com/Gifts/form1.php the content looks centered vertically
19:36  daviddoria: but if I try to specify it explicitly with   padding-top: 10%;  padding-bottom: 10%; the white part extends off the page on the bottom http://daviddoria.com/Gifts/form2.php
19:37  daviddoria: can anyone explain why that would happen?
19:39  Tempus2: Try remove the height: property from your body element, see if it changes anything
19:41  daviddoria: nope, no change
19:42  daviddoria: I also don't understand how it was kind of automatically centered on form1.php ?
19:42  daviddoria: I would have expected the first 'lights' image to be at the top of the white box
19:44  Tempus2: Okay listen, before you go any further, don't set dimensions to html, set main dimensions to body, then make a new container inside body. Set background etc to the body element instead.
19:44  daviddoria: ok, why though?
19:45  Tempus2: because html isn't really a part of the DOM
19:45  Tempus2: Although it works with most browsers
19:45  Tempus2: Body is the element that is displayed in the view-port of your browser
19:46  Tempus2: HTML is above that, has properties that isn't displayd inside the box, like the title on the window-bar for instance
19:46  daviddoria: ah, interesting
19:46  daviddoria: yes, this is more like what I expected
19:46  daviddoria: http://daviddoria.com/Gifts/form1.php
19:47  Tempus2: Okay, you can take it from there?
19:47  Tempus2: And another hint, don't use percentage, unless you really need it
19:47  zamabe: bam bam, bam bam bam. You wanna take it from here BamBam?
19:47  daviddoria: isn't the idea of % that you don't need to know the resolution of the viewer's screen?
19:48  Tempus2: In those cases yes
19:48  Tempus2: But you use percentage for everything :)
19:48  daviddoria: yea, because I don't know the resolution of the viewer's screen :)
19:48  Tempus2: On my screen, the spaces are quite large around your content
19:49  Tempus2: has about 600px from the top of the view-port down to your white area
19:49  daviddoria: yea me too
19:49  daviddoria: but why is the white area not centered in the green area?
19:50  Tempus2: remove the relative position from body
19:50  Tempus2: The body should be the whole viewport
19:50  Tempus2: From top to the end of scrolling
19:50  Tempus2: from left to right, meaning relative position shouldn't be there
19:51  Tempus2: body shouldn't have any position
19:51  Tempus2: Body should be everything you see
19:51  daviddoria: i thought the positon propery controlled how things beneath the current element behaved?
19:51  Tempus2: then you make containers inside body which you move around ;)
19:51  Tempus2: no position controls how the current element should behave
19:52  Tempus2: if you want to move your white box around, it should be relative
19:52  daviddoria: ok
19:52  Tempus2: what you can do though is to use margins on your body element
19:53  daviddoria: margins or padding?
19:53  Tempus2: margins
19:53  Tempus2: padding!
19:53  daviddoria: I thought margins were "outside" of the object?
19:53  Tempus2: My mistake
19:53  daviddoria: haha phew! i was like man now i'm really confused
19:53  lump`: i have an issue, IE8 is repeating a section of content for seemingly no reason
19:54  Tempus2: But your height should be fixed
19:54  Tempus2: Or not specified at all
19:54  daviddoria: so what happens if the height of the object is very small, and you only give very small padding to the body ?
19:55  Tempus2: width is fine though, but imagine someone opening your page on a cellphone, they will see a small small white box with the corner of your lights image and a green border around it
19:55  lump`: http://www.livinginstore.com/store/  the wishlist link at the bottom has it's background image repeated about 10px below the wishlist
19:55  lump`: i've no idea how or why
19:56  lump`: if i reduce the size of that wishlist, it cuts the top image short but still shows the repeated image!
19:57  daviddoria: thanks Tempus2, let me play with a for a bit and I'll report back if I'm still confuse
19:57  daviddoria: d
19:57  lump`: can someone please help?
19:57  Tempus2: lump`: it happens to your shopping cart too
19:57  lump`: yes i know! just IE
19:58  Tempus2: You need to make sure the tops and bottoms are fixed and the center element fixed
19:58  lump`: i've had to restyle this horrible software
19:58  lump`: tops and bottoms are fixed?
19:59  Tempus2: yes, you need to make top and bottom containers of their own
19:59  Tempus2: And the variable content area expandable
20:00  Tempus2: I tried to put things in the shopping cart and the expected happend, it has the same flaw
20:00  lump`: i don't get you at all
20:00  lump`: i need a position:fixed element at the bottom of this wishlist container?
20:01  Tempus2: <div id="shopping_cart_top"><div id="shopping_cart_content"></div><div id="shopping_card_bottom">
20:01  Tempus2: no, not fixed lol
20:01  lump`: bear in mind i didn't write the html for this, it's being generated by some bullshit software i don't want to use
20:01  lump`: but have to
20:01  Tempus2: THen if those areas are 1 element you're out of luck
20:02  Tempus2: Seems bottom of that shopping-cart has an independant bottom, but not top
20:03  lump`: i'm really confused
20:03  Tempus2: Let me look at the source then
20:03  lump`: 1 second
20:04  Tempus2: ouch what a mess :P
20:04  lump`: yep! tell me about it
20:04  tw2113: is there any reason why an unordered list nested as a child in an ordered list, would inheret the numbering when list-style-type is set to an unordered one?
20:05  lump`: http://pastebin.com/5PUjh8zS
20:05  Tempus2: "home-box-small-header" is the header of what?
20:05  lump`: i have absolutely no idea
20:05  lump`: i made none of this...
20:06  lump`: i'm just being told to style it by a designer
20:06  tw2113: nevermind
20:06  lump`: who doesn;t know how to style it himself
20:06  tw2113: carry on :D
20:06  bfred: I remember seeing multiple borders... or was I just dreaming? are they supported without having to use :after, box-shadows, multiple elements, etc... ?
20:06  bfred: *nor border-image
20:07  lump`: not afaik bfred
20:07  lump`: maybe CSS3?
20:07  Tempus2: bleh, the code even has in-line styling? Is that provided by you or is it already in the code?
20:07  lump`: like i said, i wrote none of it
20:07  lump`: i just want to kill it
20:07  bfred: lump`: apparently not :| http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/
20:07  tw2113: stab it with a spork!
20:07  lump`: burn it, make it mself
20:07  bfred: it's strange... multiple text-shadows but not borders
20:08  tw2113: elements can have multiple shadows
20:08  Tempus2: bfred: background isn't the border element
20:08  lump`: Tempus2... save me... please :''(
20:09  tw2113: mark up your rates by 150%
20:09  Tempus2: Well, if you haven't set your images to fixed, please try that
20:10  Tempus2: background: url(image) no-repeat;
20:10  lump`: yeh they are
20:10  Tempus2: gah I don't remember the syntax, look it up in the referance
20:10  lump`: it's just one background image
20:10  lump`: background: fixed
20:10  Tempus2: reference*
20:10  lump`: just done this
20:10  lump`: hmmm, now the image has died, oops, try again
20:11  Tempus2: then you probably wrote something wrong
20:11  Tempus2: let me see the CSS please
20:12  Tempus2: for that element
20:12  Tempus2: in a pastie, not in the channel
20:12  lump`: yeh ok 1 sec
20:13  lump`: fixed didn't work
20:14  lump`: wow IE doesn't let me copy styles
20:14  tw2113: IE doesn't let you browse the internet either
20:14  tw2113: not without PAIN
20:15  Tempus2: No fixed wouldn't do it
20:15  {bosco}: so www.uhcplinic.com there is on the right hand side a js slide show how do i move that over a bit to the right??
20:15  {bosco}: www.uhpclinic.com
20:15  {bosco}: srry
20:15 --- zendfan_ is now known as zendfan
20:16  Tempus2: Fail. [R]etry, [I]gnore, [A]bort ?
20:16  tw2113: egads!
20:16  tw2113: bad markup!
20:16  tw2113: i hope their medical care quality is higher than their site markup
20:17  lump`: http://pastebin.com/KeHGzpam
20:17  tw2113: sorry, but that's how i feel
20:18  lump`: Tempus2, that's the styling for the said wishlist background image
20:18  Tempus2: Okay lump`, there's hope after all
20:18  lump`: oooh!
20:18  {bosco}: so then how would someone redo the website and keep it looking the same??
20:19  foo: hmmm, now why would margin-bottom on a tr not work. /me scratches head
20:19  Tempus2: lol
20:20  Tempus2: because a <tr> isn't an element that has a visual?
20:20  foo: Tempus2: Hmmm, "has a visual" - what do you mean?
20:20  lump`: what's the hope Tempus2 ?
20:20  Tempus2: <tr> isn't an element you can see
20:20  {bosco}_: so??
20:20  foo: Tempus2: hmm, would I have to do it on the td ?
20:20  foo: I guess that's the same.
20:20  Tempus2: It can't contain any content, other than <th> or <td>
20:21  foo: Tempus2: so I need to set table spacing?
20:21  Tempus2: I don't know what you're trying to do
20:21  foo: Tempus2: good question :)
20:21  {bosco}_: clean up the code??
20:21  tw2113: a wonderful start
20:21  Tempus2: Are you just wanting emtpy space below a table-row?
20:21  {bosco}_: and move the js image slideshow to the right and make it smaller
20:21  foo: Tempus2: I have a table, styled the tr's with CSS, and I want to have them spaced out 10px apart (top/bottom
20:22  tw2113: get rid of the table for layout
20:22  lump`: space the td;s?
20:22  lump`: add new empty td's which are 10px high
20:22  foo: tw2113: eh, this is some autogenerated code that I don't have control over
20:22  Tempus2: put margin on the tds or padding on the <table>
20:22  lump`: between each row
20:22  ASche: hi
20:22  tw2113: submit inputs are not meant for a menu, on the left
20:23  lump`: back to me now?
20:23  ASche: how can i remove all padding from an input button with css in IE7 ?
20:23  lump`: padding:0px;
20:23  tw2113: input { padding: 0; }
20:23  ASche: yes, but doesnt work
20:23  foo: Tempus2: hmmm. will try to put padding on table. thanks
20:23  {bosco}_: tw2113: how do i change those to links and still make them look the same
20:24  lump`: sure it's not margin that you're seeing?
20:24  ASche: i show you my code, wait
20:24  tw2113: personally, i'd change them to an unordered list with links inside the <li> tags, and style them to be that height/width with a black background and the blue border
20:24  mechina: hey, I'm having some trouble with getting 2 divs to sit side by side. my website is: http://www.hamechina.org.il/. I'm trying to get the dates in the marquee (yes, I know, it's just the easiest way right now) to be the height of the whole li so that multi-line text is all to one side of it and not below it.
20:25  Tempus2: or margin on the table-cells
20:25  mechina: height: 100%; sucks
20:25  tw2113: set the links to display block so the whole thing is clickable
20:25  lump`: mechina,  float:left?
20:25  foo: Tempus2: how would I put a margin on the "table cells" ?
20:25  Beta2K: Hello all
20:25  foo: Tempus2: that's more what I'm after I think. putting a margin on the table just puts a margni around the whole table (or padding around the whole table
20:25  Tempus2: because that will make margins between the cells?
20:25  Tempus2: I said PADDING ON THE TABLE, margin on the table-cells
20:25  zamabe: lol
20:25  lump`: <Tempus2> Okay lump`, there's hope after all
20:25  lump`: WHAT HOPE!?
20:25  lump`: !
20:25  mechina: lump': that would send lines that are too short to the left
20:26  zamabe: that you get it right?
20:26  lump`: mechina, make thos lines have a fixed width?
20:26  foo: Tempus2: heh, thank you. .table-name margin-cells { ...;  } ?
20:26  foo: (doubt it)
20:26  Tempus2: Okay lump`: Find the HTML in which that sets the style too and put it in a pastie
20:26  tw2113: tables are a flat out headache
20:26  Beta2K: I'm trying to make two divs layout on the same line as I have before but even with display: inline and widths set on the divs they display on two lines
20:26  mechina: lump`: that could work, but then dates of various lengths could be a problem
20:27  lump`: standard formatting on dates?
20:27  mechina: I guess that's a sacrifice I could make
20:27  lump`: DD/MM/YYYY
20:27  Sirisian|Work: when using: cursor: url(cursor.png), auto; is there a color key for transparent?
20:27  lump`: Tempus2, i pasted it earlier
20:27  lump`: 1 second
20:27  Tempus2: margin = space outside an element, padding = space inside to the content inside
20:27  foo: Tempus2: unless you mean tr, but I doubt that too
20:28  lump`: http://pastebin.com/5PUjh8zS    http://pastebin.com/KeHGzpam
20:28  Tempus2: Unknown pastie id
20:28  gnarf: foo: table td { margin: 5px; }
20:28  Tempus2: for instance
20:28  lump`: ah it expired
20:29  ASche: http://pastebin.com/Fj0vHeVN
20:29  ASche: heres my code
20:29  ASche: in ie7
20:29  ASche: the padding exists
20:29  ASche: and in others browsers not
20:29  foo: gnarf: thank you. #trying
20:29  ASche: im talking about the padding around the button
20:30  Tempus2: if you want a specific table just use the table id eg #my_table td{ /* style here */ }
20:30  gnarf: ?ui position
20:30  foo: gnarf: the reason why that doesn't work is because I hvae a border on tr, and when I add margins to the td, it just blows up the whole tr... maybe I want to apply this border to td instead? hm. maybe that's better
20:30  Tempus2: around the button?
20:30  zamabe: table[name="name"]
20:30  zamabe: :D
20:31  ASche: Tempus2 , i want no margin/padding
20:31  totimkopf: hi, I am trying to get another div beneath my footer but it's merging together and ruining my footer, how can I fix this?
20:31  ASche: in the button
20:31  Tempus2: in the button or around the button?
20:31  ASche: is the same haha
20:31  lump`: http://pastebin.com/DBVV6JhN    http://pastebin.com/PgNUjq6T   <-- GOGOGO
20:31  Tempus2: the text should like the border?
20:31  Tempus2: lick*
20:32  ASche: im talking around the button, but if i put margin:0 is the same
20:32  Tempus2: lump`: try setting the backgroun the the home-box-header thing instead, see where that gets you
20:33  Tempus2: home-box-small-header or whatever
20:33  lump`: eeep, will do
