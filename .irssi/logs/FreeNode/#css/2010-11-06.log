00:02  mephux: man, can;t figure this out - if someone has a second can you take a peek - maybe i am missing something obviosu? http://99.34.169.104:8080/events/queue  user: snorby@snorby.org pass: snorby
00:03  mephux: obvious*
00:04  ZombieLoffe: what am I supposed to see here, mephux?
00:04  mephux: ZombieLoffe: the content div not wrapping the content
00:05  ZombieLoffe: ah.
00:05  mephux: so the whole issue is the top right drop down menu
00:06  ZombieLoffe: mephux, how are you clearing it? I'm not finding any :after declarations..
00:06  mephux: the only way i can get that to work is with overflow hidden on content then it braks the drop down
00:06  mephux: ZombieLoffe: shit.. forgot one sec.. so just #content:after
00:06  ZombieLoffe: mephux, use the :after method to clear the floats -- riven linked you to an article describing it awhile back
00:06  mephux: i dont have any float tho?
00:06  mephux: well one sec
00:07  ZombieLoffe: Um.. yes, you do
00:07  ZombieLoffe: #events is floated, for one
00:07  mephux: eee shit.. that should not be good find
00:08  mephux: fing 960
00:08  mephux: damn
00:08  ZombieLoffe: indeed. Easy fix -- #events { float: none; } :)
00:08  mephux: ZombieLoffe: your the man
00:08  p3lim: how can I turn an image with css?
00:08  mephux: thank you
00:09  riven: p3lim: as in rotate?
00:09  p3lim: riven: correct
00:09  riven: p3lim: css transforms, only supported by modern browsers.
00:09  ZombieLoffe: no probs.
00:09  p3lim: fuck IE
00:09  riven: `css3 2d transforms
00:09  rivvles: CSS3 2D Transforms: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms
00:09  mephux: ZombieLoffe: i really appreciate it cheers :) have a good weekend
00:10  ZombieLoffe: you too broseph.
00:10  p3lim: can be done by html too if that is supported by older browsers tho
00:10  ZombieLoffe: whut?
00:10  p3lim: rivvles: thanks
00:13  Suzie: Can someone help me please
00:14  Suzie: With a small bit of css
00:14  boogyman: `ask
00:14  rivvles: Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help. Just ask your question or state your problem and wait. Oh, and be sure to read the channel topic.
00:14  boogyman: `bot @ p3lim 
00:14  rivvles: boogyman, command 'bot' not found. Try `search <query> to search for commands.
00:14  p3lim: ?
00:15  Danny``: lol gee you are lazy
00:15  boogyman: so :P
00:15  Danny``: `ham sandwhich @ Danny``
00:15  Suzie: www.suziegibb.com 
00:16  Danny``: wow
00:16  Suzie: thats my website, on the sidebar, at the top. It says "categories", is there a way to remove this? Everytime i remove it, or edit it, it edits the title "tag cloud", which is also in the sidebar
00:17  Danny``: That is a WordPress question
00:17  riven: `v www.suziegibb.com
00:17  rivvles: (www.suziegibb.com) Markup: invalid • errors: 5 • warnings: 6 • doctype: XHTML 1.0 Strict • charset: utf-8 • validation result: http://goo.gl/tZFq2
00:17  rivvles: (www.suziegibb.com) CSS: invalid • errors: 3 • warnings: 0 • profile: css3 • validation result: http://goo.gl/FqeLd
00:17  Suzie: They tell me its a css issue, 
00:17  Suzie: rivvles they are errors that can be ignored
00:18  Danny``: Don't ever tell them that heh
00:18  Danny``: It will fall on deaf ears. Just fix the errors
00:18  haroldini: look into my eyes danny... you are feeling sleepy
00:18  Suzie: rivvles but thankyou anyway :)
00:18  Danny``: That site's design makes me want to forget
00:19  Suzie: Danny`` what site design?
00:19  Danny``: suziegibb.com heh
00:19  boogyman: at least she's using a strict doctype :), even though she's parsing as text/html 
00:20  Danny``: I admire the effort though
00:20  Danny``: If you did that all by yourself with no prior web experience
00:20  riven: boogyman: um
00:20  riven: boogyman: are you like, very confused?
00:20  Suzie: Danny`` its not completed yet, i have a ton of different themes, from the sbar, to the nav, to the main_bg etc... thats not my intended design, il update the real design that i want, when i have everything in place
00:20  Danny``: Why not just update it now? 0.o
00:20  Suzie: Danny`` thanks :) i have been using code for about a week now
00:20  boogyman: riven: we already know I need professional help
00:21  haroldini: Suzie, tht's a wordpress problem. The title is generated by wordpress. The reason the  Tag Cloud is also being removed is because the id's and classes are the same for both pieces of content. So by removing one, you are removing the other.
00:21  Danny``: *ahem*
00:21  Danny``: WordPress
00:21  Danny``: Use the camel case before Matt Mullenweg starts cracking skulls
00:21  Suzie: Danny`` OCD lol :)
00:21  haroldini: Danny when i click my fingers you will think you are a chicken.
00:21  Suzie: is wordpress not liked in here?
00:21  mekwall: we love it!
00:22  mephux: meh
00:22  Danny``: All the sites I do are in WP, some of the demigods here swear by things like modx though
00:22  Danny``: We all universally hate Drupal though
00:22  boogyman: ModX, wut wut?
00:22  mephux: rails ;)
00:23  haroldini: I like Drupal ;)
00:23  Danny``: ^ Troll
00:23  mekwall: wp might be good looking, but at its core its pure evil
00:23  riven: Better known as DruFail
00:23  Danny``: Loving the CamelCase there
00:23  haroldini: DruFriend.
00:23  Suzie: Can someone tell me, about IE problems, my site doesnt show properly in IE - but im told that i need to make several sheets, for IE's different versions. Will this be hard?
00:24  mekwall: DrFiend :p
00:24  haroldini: Who is telling you these things Suzie? 
00:24  Suzie: and can i do it, once i have finished my current stylesheet for firefox?
00:24  mekwall: Dru*
00:24  Suzie: people from here a few days ago
00:24  Danny``: Suzie: You need to make a seperate stylesheet for every browser currently in use
00:24  Danny``: opera.css, firefox.css, ie6.css
00:24  Danny``: etc
00:24  Suzie: how many is that in total? lol
00:24  ZombieLoffe: Stop trolling, Danny``.
00:25  mekwall: Thats not helping...
00:25  riven: opera 9, opera 9.2, opera 9.5, opera 9.8, opera 10, opera 10.5, opera 10.6, opera 10.7...
00:25  riven: gl.
00:25  p3lim: anyone here with photoshop or something that can make me something _really_ simple?
00:25  p3lim: cba downloading huge software
00:25  ZombieLoffe: p3lim, #css-lance or something. Hugely off-topic in here.
00:25  Suzie: wow, is it hard? and will it take long? Or will i just be making slight modifications to my current sheet? 
00:26  Suzie: And will i have to do it, every time a new browser version is released?
00:26  Danny``: maybe p3lim
00:26  Danny``: what is it
00:26  Danny``: Suzie: i was just kidding
00:26  ZombieLoffe: Suzie: /ignore Danny``. You don't ever need a separate stylesheet for every browser >_>
00:26  Danny``: Just make sure everything works right in firefox first before worrying about IE
00:27  p3lim: Danny``: a triangle at 30x30 with a transparent background, in this angle: http://www.simul8.com/i2/1st_column_corner_triangle.gif
00:27  p3lim: just white
00:27  ZombieLoffe: p3lim, gimp is free and not that huge. 
00:27  p3lim: be it png or gif, that doesnt matter
00:27  Suzie: ZombieLoffe oh lol, gotcha, Danny`` lol nice one. But when i come to worrying about IE, is it a hard task? and can it be done in one day??
00:27  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: I remember attempting at using alpha channels in gimp before, it failed horrible
00:28  p3lim: s/horrible/horribly
00:28  boogyman: Danny``: Fx isn't the "end all be all user-agent", there are others [User Agents] that support web site standards
00:28  ZombieLoffe: Suzie: Depends hugely on your CSS skill level :F
00:28  Danny``: boogyman: Thanks for stating the obvious
00:28  mekwall: Suzie. ie6 is a nightmare. 7+ is bareable
00:28  Suzie: ie6 is ancient isnt it?
00:29  riven: ie6 is irrelevant.
00:29  ZombieLoffe: IE6 is not worth bothering with, usually.
00:29  boogyman: IE1 is ancient, IE6 is ... 
00:29  mekwall: If google is the ref :p
00:29  riven: also ancient.
00:29  ZombieLoffe: IE6 turns 10 next year, that's ancient in Web terms :)
00:29  Suzie: lol! im suprised IE still doesnt support flash
00:29 * riven sighs
00:29  mekwall: Damn. Then im the big bang, in web terms
00:30  Danny``: p3lim: http://cl.ly/50f3899d94ad4afa0bf3
00:30  ZombieLoffe: Suzie: Huh? "Doesn't support flash"..?
00:30  Suzie: ZombieLoffe yeah, or at least mine doesnt
00:30  boogyman: ZombieLoffe: let her think that :)
00:30  ZombieLoffe: Of course it does :F
00:30  Suzie: i look at my tag cloud, and its just a list
00:30  mekwall: Suzie, you need the activex plugin 
00:31  p3lim: Danny``: sorry, I gave you the wrong angle, its the opposite way :/
00:31  Danny``: You need the MySearch web toolbar for IE
00:31  Danny``: p3lim so flip it, sorry I closed it
00:31  mekwall: Danny, shut it already.
00:31  Suzie: oh; if i have IE7, how can i look how my site looks like in IE6?
00:31  Suzie: do i have to rollback the install?
00:31  boogyman: Suzie: By not worrying about IE6 :)
00:31  ZombieLoffe: Suzie, there's IETester for Windows
00:31  Danny``: Yes, just wrap the page's markup in <!-- markup here -->
00:32  Danny``: That's the shorthand way
00:32  ZombieLoffe: preaction, can has Danny`` banned?
00:32  Danny``: Ah man I'm just kidding, why are you getting mad
00:32  Suzie: ZombieLoffe if i type "ietester" in yahoo, can i find a download? and is it free? :)
00:32  ZombieLoffe: yes and yes, Suzie
00:32  Suzie: boogyman ild love to :) im going to see how bad it is first :)
00:33  Danny``: Judging by your current layout it is going to be bad. Very bad
00:33  mekwall: Danny, because you are spreading misinformation.
00:33  Suzie: ZombieLoffe thankyou, il go download it now
00:33  Danny``: Have you thought about hiring someone to fix it for you?
00:33  p3lim: Danny``: thanks tho ;)
00:34  preaction: Danny``: seriously, stop with the "joke" advice. there are users who will actually "sudo rm -rf /" without knowing what it does
00:34  Danny``: Alright
00:34  Suzie: ZombieLoffe is it 0.4.6? the version i mean, of ietester? or doesnt it really matter?
00:34  Danny``: Suzie I will be srs now
00:35  ZombieLoffe: I've no idea. Get the latest.
00:35  Danny``: You use windows right?
00:35  Danny``: MultipleIE should work fine if you want to install a standalone of version 6
00:35  mekwall: Danny, jokes are only fun when you understand them. Use that as a basis for future attempts...
00:36  Suzie: so im looking to download multipleIE?
00:36  Danny``: Who are you?
00:36  Danny``: http://multipleies.en.softonic.com/
00:36  riven: Suzie: did your boss/client ask you to support ie6? If not, why are you bothering?
00:36  Danny``: I think this is for her personal site
00:36  Suzie: Suzie im the boss lol. 
00:36  Suzie: why the hell did i type suzie
00:36  mekwall: lol
00:37  Suzie: no but im a little worried that i may miss clients, who cant view my website, due to them using IE6, or is this a very rare issue?
00:37  mekwall: Talking to yourself usually gives the best response :)
00:38  Suzie: mekwall lmao
00:38  mekwall: Suzie, ask google why they dropped support for ie6
00:38  ZombieLoffe: Suzie, IIRC the US useage is down to 5-6% or so
00:38  Danny``: I think it is a bit higher than that
00:39  riven: Suzie: outside of work hours, IE6 has ~2.5% market share in the western world. You decide ;)
00:39  Danny``: I stopped testing for IE at all on my projects like a year ago, and have only gotten one request to fix
00:39  Danny``: saves time, lol
00:39  nkuttler: the usage share is kinda irrelevant. the business share is relevant. i always assume ie6 users don't buy anything
00:40  p3lim: got an issue btw, using line-height: 0px; to avoid huge spaces between lines, but when a line wraps due to length, it overlaps the past line
00:40  Suzie: okay, il avoid IE6 usage
00:40  Danny``: nkuttler: too cheap to buy new computers? :P
00:40  Danny``: What if they're browsing from work
00:40  Suzie: ietester has ie5.5, do i need to leave that too?
00:40  Danny``: No
00:40  mekwall: Danny, too cheap to buy a new browser
00:41  nkuttler: i have an ie5 copy around. just for fun
00:41  Danny``: mekwall, I'm assuming anybody who used IE6 stock doesn't know other browsers exist and their only avenue for getting a new one is to buy a current computer
00:42  mekwall: Probably the true
00:42  johan_bouveng: ie6 is a competent browser
00:42  mekwall: Suzie, are you just entering the business or is this a one-time thing? 
00:42  boogyman: johan_bouveng: and I am a woman :-s
00:43  mekwall: and I am big bang
00:43  Suzie: ive been in the buisiness a while mekwall, but i have a .info address, i want a real strong .com address, thats modern and sleek
00:43  johan_bouveng: boogyman: ?
00:43  johan_bouveng: Suzie: modern and sleek?
00:44  Danny``: .com addresses are percieved as modern and sleek?
00:44  Danny``: Interesting, I heard someone talking similar to that in #web a few minutes ago
00:44  nkuttler: .com? that was modern in the late 90s
00:44  Suzie: .com just sounds better then .info in my opinion.
00:44  mekwall: Suzie, what business is that? Im on my phone right now so not really paying attention to links :)
00:44  Suzie: hypnosis
00:45  nkuttler: orly?
00:45  nkuttler: too bad, i already stopped smoking a decade ago
00:45  johan_bouveng: instantinduction.com
00:45  johan_bouveng: :)
00:45  johan_bouveng: go fetch
00:45  Suzie: comedy hypnosis lol and hypnotherapy
00:45  nkuttler: that's a nice combo   .oO
00:45  mekwall: Suzie, I understand your feeling about .com, but its not that important tbh.
00:46  Danny``: design and content is definitely more important
00:46  mekwall: Suzie, it depends on what youre selling :)
00:46  eighty4: it's all about .me now!
00:46  Suzie: lol im off guys :) thanks for all the help :) so much :)
00:46  nkuttler: hypnos.is
00:46  nkuttler: hehe
00:47  Danny``: except .biz, that is a killer
00:47  mekwall: Good one :)
00:47  johan_bouveng: .com is classic
00:47  eighty4: Danny``: .biz isn't even on the map :)
00:47  mekwall: .is is what country?
00:47  johan_bouveng: island?
00:47  nkuttler: .biz couldn't afford .com, or it was already taken
00:47  nkuttler: ya
00:47  johan_bouveng: iceland
00:47  Danny``: I don't think .biz is cheaper
00:48  nkuttler: auctions
00:48  johan_bouveng: i just bought a .com
00:48  nkuttler: cybersquatting etc
00:48  nkuttler: anyway, my CSS is borken. help!
00:48  Danny``: Eh, if you have a good name squatting isn't a big deal
00:49  mekwall: im always intrigued about how users with female nicks get approached by the rest
00:49  Danny``: I noticed you kind of white knighting, lol
00:49  nkuttler: for me it was just the hypno thing. i don't belive in irc names
00:50  Danny``: It is pretty funny that it drums up so much interest
00:50  Danny``: Even though you could see the pic of her on the site ...... ;P
00:50  nkuttler: site?
00:50  Danny``: yeah
00:50  Danny``: I forget the url
00:50  Danny``: http://www.suziegibb.com/
00:51  Danny``: Supposedly only doing code for a week, I see some intricate effects on there
00:51  nkuttler: ummm
00:51  ZombieLoffe: meh, it's a wp theme
00:51  Danny``: The logo too?
00:51  Danny``: It looks like the frankenstein WP theme
00:51  Danny``: different parts
00:51  nkuttler: nothing wrong with wp
00:52  ZombieLoffe: The logo is some pre-packaged JS script
00:52  ZombieLoffe: She was in here a few weeks ago asking for help with that logo, btw.
00:52  Danny``: hellish looking though. Damn
00:52  Danny``: Ah.
00:52  Danny``: I figured that
00:52  eighty4: oh, that site
00:52  eighty4: ZombieLoffe: and the menu and, ...
00:53  ZombieLoffe: Indeed.
00:53  mekwall: and the channel went dead with the female departure heh
00:53  Ziber: How can I change the formatting of the title text of a hyperlink?
00:53  eighty4: But than again, I'm all for people trying new things. It's brave to try and get a site working
00:53  eighty4: Ziber: you cant
00:53  neophyte: How would you add a table heading in XHTML?
00:53  Danny``: How did the channel go dead?
00:54  Danny``: mekwall as far as I can tell you were the only one brown nosing
00:54  Ziber: eighty4: there has to be a way...
00:54  eighty4: Ziber: it has?
00:54  Danny``: Makes me ashamed to be a guy -_-
00:54  eighty4: neophyte: a what?
00:54  nkuttler: Ziber: you can use no title and make JS tooltips. fail though.
00:54  Ziber: why does it fail?
00:54  eighty4: Danny``: it makes most guys ashamed ;)
00:54  nkuttler: because
00:55  Danny``: Especially because the girls know exactly what they're doing lol
00:55  eighty4: Ziber: you can basically "mimic" the effect with JS but you cant change the tooltip
00:55  Ziber: eighty4: cant change it from what?
00:55  nkuttler: Ziber: and using JS for such a thing... well... it's just stupid. although my idea was clever
00:56  mekwall: Danny, lol... I must have been lagging behind. Just got flooded with messages
00:56  eighty4: Danny``: you do realize there's probably a couple of girls in here nicking guys name just because the reaction when a "girl" joins an irc channel
00:56  Ziber: nkuttler: well, what do you recommend in the way of changing the format of a title?
00:56  nkuttler: Ziber: i recommend not to change it
00:56  p3lim: got an issue btw, using line-height: 0px; to avoid huge spaces between lines, but when a line wraps due to length, it overlaps the past line
00:56  Danny``: Well they are the noble ones, then
00:56  mekwall: Im on my android so could be crappy reception
00:56  eighty4: p3lim: so don't use line-height 0
00:57  Danny``: Are you out somewhere or something
00:57  Ziber: nkuttler: why?
00:57  Danny``: Maybe at a party lol
00:57  nkuttler: Ziber: didn't i say it's stupid? of course, if you have a client who wants it i'd understand..
00:57  eighty4: Danny``: the way most irc channels react when a "female nick" joins is a bit sad
00:57  Ziber: nkuttler: i thought you meant using JS for it was stupid. like you had a better way to do it. 
00:58  mekwall: Danny, and im always trying to be helpful no matter the sex...
00:58  Danny``: mekwall, yeah but look at your interactions with me
00:59  mekwall: eighty4, probably the other way around as well
00:59  Danny``: Would you have admonished me the way you did if the person had been a 300pound ponytailed neckbeard
00:59  nkuttler: Ziber: it's stupid to *do* it at all, i don't care how you do it
00:59  Danny``: and made playful jokes with him
00:59  Danny``: lol
01:00  mekwall: and now im lagging behind again :(
01:01  eighty4: Danny``: I do try to treat everyone the same
01:01  Danny``: Me too, I only noticed mekwall really doin it but didn't point it out right then because I was ashamed of my gender and I didn't want to make it look like I was trying to be impressive
01:02  ZombieLoffe: Danny`` is a troll towards everyone, tbh.
01:02  Danny``: Truth
01:02  ZombieLoffe: Better to just /ignore and be done with it.
01:02  Danny``: Regardless of gender, ethnicity
01:02  Danny``: etc
01:02  Danny``: have you ignored me zombie?
01:03  mekwall: Danny, your jokes was bad, thats all
01:03  Danny``: If you say so
01:04  mekwall: My opinion :)
01:04  mekwall: Im not hostile towards you if you think that
01:04  eighty4: Danny``: on the other hand, since females are so rare shouldn't we try to make them feel welcome?
01:05  Danny``: Why?
01:05  Danny``: Why should they get treated any differently than anybody else in this channel?
01:05  nkuttler: females are like 50.7% of all humans
01:05  mekwall: Haha
01:05  mekwall: Now that was funny :)
01:05  eighty4: and like 0.003% of all irc
01:06  nkuttler: time to get out of mom's basement ;)
01:06  Danny``: People come here to give and recieve support with various programming/tech related stuff
01:06  mekwall: Actually, i met my first love through irc lol
01:06  Danny``: Why would gender enter into the equation at all
01:06  eighty4: Danny``: and in general a group with only guys (read the irc) tends to be a bit... well not sure how to translate this into english
01:07  eighty4: Danny``: an environment not that welcoming of girls
01:07  Danny``: Howso?
01:07  mekwall: because its natural, Danny
01:07  Danny``: with IRC you don't even have to make your gender known
01:07  eighty4: Danny``: so you're saying you're a transgender?
01:07  mekwall: eighty4, abnouxious?
01:07  mekwall: ob*
01:08  Danny``: No...?
01:08  eighty4: mekwall: there's a good swedish word for it :)
01:08  eighty4: Grabbig
01:08  mekwall: eighty, well... thats what we are...
01:08  ZombieLoffe: machismo
01:08  mekwall: exactly
01:08  Danny``: Real world results show that a group like this is the opposite of unwelcoming to girls :p
01:09  Danny``: To the point of pathetic pandering
01:09  mekwall: just as girls go to the toilet together
01:09  mekwall: its not weird unless you make it so
01:09  ZombieLoffe: you just shouldn't treat people differently because of their gender, period. Whether negative or positive.
01:09  Danny``: I agree
01:10  eighty4: maybe you shouldn't but you tend to do, how ever sad it might be
01:10  Danny``: I don't
01:12  mekwall: I will quote Morgan Freeman on how to stop rasism... Stop talking about it :)
01:12  Danny``: You started the discussion
01:12  eighty4: Danny``: but you have to agree with me that groups of only guys tend to be different to a mixed group.
01:12  Danny``: I agree
01:13  mekwall: all kinds of groupings are bad.
01:14  mekwall: no matter if its gender, religion, sexuality or race...
01:42  FastJack: yeah, race. don't discriminate neanderthals. they're people too

02:36  amh345: super basic CSS question (still learning).   what is the best way to get two divs to display underneath one another?  is there a way that i can create a div class and make everything appear below one another without constraining "top" pixels?
02:36  oksushi: amh345: that will occur by default
02:36  amh345: if it's on a div class?
02:36  amh345: in*
02:37  amh345: oh, i see what ypou're saying
02:37  oksushi: <div>Something</div><div>something else</div> --> unless you are telling them not to they will appear one on top of the other
02:38  amh345: hmm, yeah. im trying to create a side bar with a bunch of different divs in it.  and then i want to make a content div to the left of it.   CSS is the most confusing thing ever. i cant wait until i 'get it'.
02:38  amh345: i thought wrapping the sidebar in a class or something would keep it all together.  maybe it's flawed logic.
02:39  oksushi: amh345: ok, what you need to do is this. 1) code just your HTML, with no regard at all for the css. This will help you to produce quality html. 2) Then start applying styles
02:39  amh345: i was trying to avoid tables/etc. if i use tables i can do it no problem..
02:40  oksushi: this has nothing to do with tables
02:40  oksushi: `separate @ amh345
02:40  rivvles: amh345, HTML/CSS/JS – Why separate? http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/4-the-web-standards-model-html-css-a/#whyseparate
02:40  amh345: what do you mean just code my html then?
02:40  amh345: do you mean put all my divs with content in them.. and once it's all there (in a jumbled mess) i should start adding my styles?
02:41  lukus: amh345, divs _divide_ your content into logical groups
02:41  oksushi: amh345: you should not be using 'divs' to begin with, most likely. You need to code your content using the most appropriate html elements
02:42  lukus: yeah, divs are the non-specific block-level element .. there are usually good specific choices, depending on yr content
02:42  amh345: it's a shopping cart. i wont be using much more than divs and p's.....  maybe some headers.
02:43  oksushi: huh? 
02:43  lukus: if you have a shopping cart .. a list might be good
02:43  oksushi: do you understand the word 'semantic'?
02:44  oksushi: amh345: the idea is, you ombibe your content with meaning by 'marking it up' using HTML elements. Making everything a 'div' does not achieve this
02:44  amh345: i've got it laid out already, graphically.  it's pretty nuts..  im just trying to fight the urge to do tables and crap like that and do it the proper way.
02:44  oksushi: *imbibe
02:46  amh345: the reason i said divs is because there are many 'segments' to a page. . and most of my content will be inside each segment..  so i thought the natual first step would be to setup all the segments. 
02:46  amh345: to *my* page.
02:47  amh345: anyways, ill go through this link posted earlier. http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/4-the-web-standards-model-html-css-a/#whyseparate
02:47  lukus: if yr not interested in front end design .. get someone else to do the job for you
02:48  amh345: where did you get that impression?
02:56  amh345: ok, read that page.  it didnt really explain anything i didnt already know, except the usage of class files versus id's(which is great to know).  
03:02  oksushi: amh345: that opera link has a lot of other pages, that are an invaluable resource
03:03  amh345: "Previous article—How does the Internet work?"
03:05  p3lim: got an issue with line-height, I need it to be 0px between lines (each <p> element) and 15px (ish) within a line (inside the <p> element, for wrapping)
03:05  oksushi: you know what a '0px' line-height would look like?
03:05  amh345: are there any slim GUI editors you guys use?   i normally work with only a textpad.  but it would be really nice to be able to see whats happening as i do it.  i'd really rather stay away from dreamwever.
03:05  oksushi: amh345: WYSIWYG editors are not recommended
03:06  amh345: why? not to standard?
03:06  p3lim: oksushi: in a wrapped line its horrible, but between each <p> element its actually right
03:06  oksushi: p3lim: example url?
03:06  p3lim: oksushi: just a second
03:08  oksushi: amh345: letting machines make decisions for you (things like what data /means/, what it should be called, etc) is never a good idea
03:08  p3lim: oksushi: http://p3lim.tumblr.com/post/1270642893
03:08  amh345: i dont think you get what im saying.
03:08  amh345: i just want to code it all myself and see it on screen as i do it.
03:09  amh345: i dont want it to "do" anything for me.
03:09  oksushi: amh345: set up your browser to refresh every so often?
03:09  p3lim: oksushi: as you see there, the space between each <p> is a bit too much, while the space between each line _within_ a <p> is too little
03:09  oksushi: p3lim: this article will help you http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm
03:10  p3lim: oksushi: I'll read, thanks
03:10  oksushi: p3lim: I use this Air app to calculate sizes etc for me http://jameswhittaker.com/journal/em-based-layouts-vertical-rhythm-calculator/ 
03:17  p3lim: oksushi: I do set the font with the #content element
03:17  p3lim: which is the first element within body
03:18  oksushi: you are using px to size the text through
03:19  oksushi: remove that, try something like this instead:
03:19  oksushi: body {font: 75%/1.5 verdana, sans-serif;} p {margin: 1em 0; font-size: 1em;}
03:20  oksushi: but you should remove the other line-height declaration on .content

03:32  amh345: does prefacing a id in a css file with div# do anything?
03:32  preaction: amh345: it then only applies to divs with that ID
03:32  preaction: ]css select @ amh345 
03:32  _ZofBot4: amh345, CSS Selectors: 1) read: http://xrl.us/bemweo [CSS2.1] http://xrl.us/bemwem [CSS3], http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/ , http://www.csarven.ca/css-specificity-and-selectors 2) Try it out: http://penguin.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py
03:32  fecal: yes... it makes the selector apply only to a div with the id of #
03:33  amh345: preaction: but .some_div only affects a div with id="some_div"..  therefor div#some_div and .some_div accomplish the same thing?
03:34  preaction: no. read the links.
03:34  fecal: a selector prefaced with . refers to a class whereas a # refers to an id
03:35  amh345: oh, sorry. i got them mixed up.
03:35  amh345: so div#some_div and #some_div are the same thing
03:35  fecal: .classname { } /* applies to any selector on the entire page with the class of classname */ div.classname { } /* applies to all div's with the class of classname */
03:35  preaction: which is what the links that the bot mentioned would have described to you

04:22  cesurasean: what does that mean exactly? I didn't know I was using XML!
04:22  JDigital: That's not close to valid HTML or XHTML

04:40  ManxPower: (leave the border off the first cell of each row)
04:41  JDigital: I'd put a class on the TD
04:42  JDigital: you could use :first-child
