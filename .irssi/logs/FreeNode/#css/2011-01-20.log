08:40  motaka2: oksushi: I have not such previous versions
08:40  oksushi: so what happened to the change you made a week or so ago
08:42  motaka2: oksushi: it is overwitten with a parellel project ,
08:46  oksushi: motaka2: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/nnpn0pwtjoocrrvcw3kmnw
08:46  oksushi: maybe learn how to log your irc sessions
08:46  MauriceJ: motaka2: You remind me of a man who batters his wife and keeps promising not to repeat the behaviour, everytime.  There is no learning only the same action and no real desire to change it.
08:47  motaka2: oksushi: thank you it is fixed, I am using chatzilla with firefox, where can I find logs ?
08:48  oksushi: use a different IRC client that has logging. I have no idea about chatzilla
08:49  MauriceJ: Chatzilla has logging if you use Google to find out how to use it....
08:50  motaka2: MauriceJ: Ok dont worry I will find it and I wonr repeat this again.
08:50  motaka2: oksushi: thanks for the help
08:50  oksushi: logs are a great way to remind people how stupid they have been
08:50  oksushi: no problem :)

09:04  motaka2: oksushi: no problem , I have to be more careful.

09:20  grease082: ok, i want to set the align to center of a div container, within the div container there's a menü which is made from the cms joomla
09:20  grease082: normally i'm setting the align to center from a div as follows:
09:20  grease082: width:950px;
09:20  grease082: 	position:relative;
09:20  grease082: 	left:50%;
09:20  grease082: 	margin-left:-475px;

12:49  5EXAB2X2P: but well IE is not changing select input height with property height:
12:53  nimred: i need to display a hr before a h1. Wich may to make them be on same line ?
12:53  oksushi: nimred: do you just need a border on the h1?
12:54  oksushi: sounds like you are trying to achieve some styling effect
12:54  nimred: oksushi: no h1 has no border and i do not want to make it be underlined
12:55  nimred: oksushi: i need a bar followed by a title
12:55  oksushi: still no reason to use an <hr>
12:55  nimred: both on same line
12:55  oksushi: it is an abuse of markup
12:55  nimred: ah so what to use ?
12:55  oksushi: border
12:55  nimred: oksushi: what css would look like ?
12:57  nimred: oksushi: what i need to get is the same as Education, Master thesis... titles from http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.tug.org/texlive/Contents/live/texmf-dist/doc/latex/moderncv/examples/template.pdf
12:57  oksushi: sure. Best thing would be to use a background-image
12:59  nimred: oksushi: isn't there a way to get it via css ?
12:59  oksushi: yes, but it would be more complex. Use an image
13:00  nimred: oksushi: i don't wnat to use any image ?!
13:00  oksushi: why?
13:01  nimred: because if i need to change color i will have to recreate image
13:01  oksushi: and how often will it change colour?
13:02  ZombieLoffe: looks like that could be a border-top on some other element
13:02  nimred: often (very or not very) is enough to not use image
13:02  nimred: ZombieLoffe: i need bar and text well aligned
13:03  nimred: i tried using a table
13:03  oksushi: nimred: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0g&raw
13:03  ZombieLoffe: well that's fail. never use table for layout.
13:03  oksushi: irrational hatred of images
13:03  nimred: but according browser bar and text are not very well aligned
13:03  oksushi: i am constantly amazed by ^^
13:03  oksushi: nimred: feel free to adjust that examle as required - no images used
13:04  nimred: oksushi: great
13:04  nimred: oksushi: thanks very much
13:05  oksushi: no worries.
13:07  nimred: oksushi: would you there be a tool to convert latex to html so that the look is kept the more as possible ?
13:07  nimred: (sorry for bad english)
13:08  johnline: trying to use content:attr(title); in a galleria element but i am worried it is being masked
13:08  oksushi: nimred: not sure about that one
13:08  oksushi: no doubt there are, google might be able to help
13:09  oksushi: johnline: uhuh, what was the url?

13:11  Anomie2: Is it possible to make these banners look ok in all screen resolutions using css? (http://ablemagazine.co.uk/) (the ones running down the middle in-between the blog posts)
13:12  oksushi: define 'look ok'?
13:12  Anomie2: not get cut off
13:13  oksushi: you want them to get narrower?
13:13  Anomie2: oksushi: you can see what I mean here http://viewlike.us/?url=ablemagazine.co.uk&button.x=0&button.y=0
13:13  Anomie2: with smaller resolutions, parts of the banners vanish behind the side-panels
13:13  oksushi: i can see that
13:14  oksushi: do you want them to get narrower?
13:14  oksushi: …
13:14  Anomie2: I'm not sure what you mean

13:19  Anomie2: oksushi: I stuck that in my css file, but it didn't do anything..
13:20  Anomie2: oksushi: Ignore my previous comment. :P it does work. I was expecting it to get bigger but I guess the 100% is the images original file.
13:20  Anomie2: That was a really easy fix - was expecting that to be a lot harder
13:20  nimred: thanks ZombieLoffe
13:20  oksushi: Anomie2: you should remove the height from the images though, so they get shorter too
13:21  oksushi: they appear to be inline

13:26  oksushi: johnline: i see nothing there
13:26  oksushi: there is no element
13:27  oksushi: ah, you need to mouse over
13:27  oksushi: the h3's below, to see it?
13:27  johnline: yeah
13:28  johnline: but that was a test, so its working on those nicely
13:28  oksushi: ok, so…
13:28  oksushi: how can i see the issue?
13:28  johnline: what i am needing is to make a 'click to enlarge' for when the main img is hovered
13:28  nimred: oksushi: your solution doesn't work using IEv7 :(
13:29  oksushi: nimred: then use a f**king image
13:29  oksushi: and stop bitching
13:29  ZombieLoffe: or use a border on another existing element.
13:29  nimred: ZombieLoffe: a border to what ?
13:30  nimred: oksushi: cool :)
13:30  ZombieLoffe: a border to.. act as a border? :P

14:18  Jopke: andyone know about this stuff and have a sec?
14:19 --- Channel #css was synced in 93 seconds
14:19  fubhy: jopke: just ask ur question
14:19  Jopke: k
14:19  ZombieLoffe: Jopke: present problem and wait.
14:19  Jopke: sorry
14:19  Jopke: margin: 0 auto; can't get it to work in IE and I don't know why
14:20  fubhy: older IE versions quire text-aling: center on the wrapper
14:20  fubhy: *require
14:20  Jopke: yeah, Ive tried all that
14:20  Jopke: it wont even center in the first place
14:20  fubhy: you also need a fixed width ofc
14:20  Jopke: yes, have one
14:20  fubhy: or at least a relative width
14:20  fubhy: post your entire css file somewhere
14:20  fubhy: and the html too
14:21  Jopke: should I post the code? or no. Ive not been in this room. not sure what the rules are
14:21  fubhy: not here, pastebin it somewhere
14:21  Jopke: ok
14:22  johnline: HALAL:hover:after{content:attr(bumploppies);position:absolute;top:0px;left:300px;} fixd it :>
14:27  Jopke: ok, I posted everything at this address:
14:27  Jopke: www.pokerhosters.com/code.txt
14:27  Jopke: my problem area is the html that is between the commented asterisks
14:28  Jopke: I need to center the entire div "QissueContainer"
14:28  fubhy: Jopke: give me a moment
14:28  Jopke: ok
14:29  fubhy: Jopke: your #QiseeContainer div has width: 100%
14:29  welander: put a exact width of the qissuecontainer and then use margin: 0 auto?
14:29  fubhy: exactly
14:30  fubhy: u cant go with width: 100% if u want to center it logicaly. you need something less than 100%
14:30  fubhy: either a fixed px width or a relative width below 100%
14:30  Jopke: i only tried the 100% after some research, I had as 762px like the outer container
14:31  Jopke: it centers fine in FF and everything else but not IE8
14:32  Jopke: that make sense? if I change the 100% to a fixed width, it makes no difference. just changed it to make sure
14:34  fubhy: I would start by cleaning up the html a bit
14:34  Jopke: i just spent 3 hours rewriting the whole thing
14:34 --- Guest61373 is now known as karstensrage
14:34  welander: http://lucaswelander.se/jopke.html <- centers in ff, ie and opera?
14:35  Jopke: yes
14:35  Jopke: no i mean, not ie
14:35 --- karstensrage is now known as Guest30629
14:35  fubhy: well
14:35  fubhy: for me it does center too
14:35  Jopke: in IE?
14:35  fubhy: yep
14:35  welander: yes
14:35  Jopke: ...
14:35  Jopke: what version?
14:35  welander: 8
14:35  fubhy: centering is pretty easy
14:35  welander: here
14:36  fubhy: text-align: center; on the wrapper for old IE support
14:36  Jopke: i dont think I understand
14:36  fubhy: and margin: auto; for every other browser
14:36  fubhy: works evertime
14:36  Jopke: not trying to be difficult, but I have it open in both and have been struggling with it for 4 days
14:36  Jopke: text-align center on the wrapper

14:43  Jopke: damn, I dont. I ommitted that part of the css because it works already
14:44  Jopke: but the "container" div that is on that html has this code
14:44  Jopke: #container        {
14:44  Jopke: width: 762px;

14:45  Jopke: really? is mine that bad?
14:46  fubhy: its not really modern ;)
14:46  Jopke: if youre going to do that, maybe I should send you the whole thing so you know whats there
14:46  Jopke: I only posted part of the file
14:47  welander: try this aswell www.lucaswelander.se/freshsite.rar
14:47  welander: i use it always when im about to start a new site
14:47  welander: and i always take as a rule to put #container div as a fixed px width with margin: 0 auto;
14:48  johnline: FUCKING IE
14:48  fubhy: i prefer grid systems
14:48  fubhy: grid-16 is always a good starting point
14:48  fubhy: with a clean reset.css in front
14:48  Jopke: hmm, welander, what is that, just like a reset of all the elements?
14:49  Jopke: fub, im still kind of a lamen... not even sure ehat that is
14:49  Jopke: if you look at pokerhosters.com/anthony and click the "waypoints" link. that is the area im trying to fix.
14:49  welander: its a complete website from scratch, ie directories like css, js, img and a .html file with the required elements to start out a website in and a reset.css  and a screen.css with the #container with styling in it
14:50  Jopke: its currently using center tags which I dont want to use cuz the html wont validate, but I cant get it to center that issue section in IE without them
14:50  welander: what IE version are you looking with?
14:50  Jopke: wow nice, ok... thanks for that then.
14:50  Jopke: I have 8
14:52  Jopke: fub, if you go to that link and view source, you can click on my entire css file.
14:52  Jopke: if itll help, not sure what you're writing but I dont want you to waste your time
14:52  Jopke: well... anymore than oyu already are I guess :)
14:53  fubhy: Jopke: well i am finished
14:53  Jopke: ok
14:54  nimred: which way to make a footer be at least at 900px bottom ?
14:55  welander: nimred #footer {min-height: 900px;} ?
14:55  Jopke: min-width?
14:55  welander: or min width depeens on what axis u wanna go
14:55  Jopke: you mean 900px from the top?
14:56  nimred: Jopke: yes
14:56  johnline: http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/projects/emirati_expressions/test.shtml
14:57  johnline: WHY GOD. on hovering the gallery in ie the text doesnt pop in
14:57  legostud: Jopke: you might want to add an generic index.html file to the root of your site just to hide your files.  http://pokerhosters.com/
14:57  Jopke: didnt think of that, thanks lego
14:57  Jopke: will do
15:00  fubhy: Jopke pm
15:00  Jopke: k
15:02  nimred: Jopke: any idea ?
15:03  Jopke: nimred, sorry
15:03  Jopke: got distractd
15:04  Jopke: you have other content on the page im assuming
15:04  Jopke: you cant find the bottom of that content and just give the footer a margin-top to put it as far down as you want it?
15:04  Jopke: maybe i dont quite get your issue
15:08  nimred: Jopke: adding a margin-top would not do what i need :it would be relative to size of previous content
15:08  nimred: i need it to be at least at 900px
15:08  nimred: from top
15:13  Jopke: if that was the case for me, I would have an outer container that was 900px high (or 850, -whatever the footer size is) put the footer at the bottom of it, and just make sure I keep all the content inside that container
15:14  Jopke: footer outside the container
15:18  nimred: ok let us min-height: 900px; as welander said
15:19  Jopke: i think i had a problem with min-height not working in IE when I tried to use it a few years ago
15:19  Jopke: so I stay away from it, but if it works for you, kudos
15:20  nimred: Jopke: looks like working using IEv7
15:21  Jopke: awesome.. im glad you figured it out then:)
15:21  Jopke: my problem is still unresolved
15:21  Jopke: stupid IE
15:23  legostud: there are min-height hacks out there

15:40  MrGlass: hey. i made some apache configurtion changes yesterday, for a different site. now my stylesheet doesnt seem the be getting applied http://makesmalltalk.com/. any idea why
15:45  fubhy: MrGlass: make the url to your css file absolute, not relative
15:45  MauriceJ: MrGlass: You do some mod_rewrite stuff?
15:45  fubhy: because /css/main.css doesnt exist at your webroot
15:45  MrGlass: MauriceJ: no
15:45  MauriceJ: Or that.
15:46  fubhy: MrGlass: I take back what i just said. http://makesmalltalk.com/css/main.css does exist
15:46  fubhy: but try to make it absolute nevertheless
15:48  MrGlass: so, any ideas?
15:49  fubhy: yes like i said
15:49  fubhy: make it absolute and try that
15:49  MrGlass: nope
15:49  fubhy: what did u change on ur apache?
15:50  fubhy: because first time i tried to open the css file manualy

15:55  johnline: I CLICKED RIGHT AWAY
15:55  danmichel: haha
15:56  fubhy: danmichel: try setting your wrapper (the fluid one) to have a right-padding of width: #WIDTH OF SIDEBAR# and position the sidebar INSIDE that wrpper and give it a NEGATIVE margin: margin-right: #WIDTH OF SIDEBAR#;
15:57  fubhy: and also give it the width ofc
15:57  danmichel: ok
15:57  fubhy: and float: right
15:57  danmichel: will try that now
15:57  fubhy: that will make the wrapper always have a padding of the size of the sidebar
15:57  fubhy: and have the sidebar move above that padding
15:57  fubhy: giving free his space in the wrapper itself
15:58  fubhy: danmichel: report back if it works or not
16:01  danmichel: give what the negative margin?
16:01  danmichel: i just did what you said btw
16:01  danmichel: fubhy:

16:09  danmichel: Jackass4D: any ideas
16:10  Jackass4D: yep
16:10  danmichel: fubhy: i know what you mean, and i tried that, but there is something wrong
16:10  Jackass4D: and many possible ways
16:10  fubhy: ye there are many possible ways
16:10  fubhy: just wait for my sample
16:11  fubhy: working on it right now
16:11  Jackass4D: danmichel
16:11  Jackass4D: the easyway
16:12  Jackass4D: is caculated the right wide for you right sidebar and left content
16:12  Jackass4D: do you get it?
16:12  Jackass4D: try adding a width for you the div that doesn't have an id to the sidebar
16:12  danmichel: no, im not sure what you mean
16:12  iaj: Hm, how could I select all p tags (no matter how deep) in a #foo div?   ain't div#foo > p { }   correct?
16:13  fubhy: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0y&raw
16:13  fubhy: thats what you want
16:13  fubhy: danmichel
16:13  Jackass4D: danmichel, div#content > div { width: 800px; } and your sidebar will float to the left
16:13  Jackass4D: i mean to the right
16:13  danmichel: ok brb
16:13  danmichel: im gonna try what he just did
16:14  iaj: mhh, ain't div#foo > div selecting all divs that appear in the div#foo pagetree?
16:14  Jackass4D: just the first iaj
16:14  iaj: which selector am I looking for then :(
16:14  cromestant: hey guys, I'm trying to modify a joomla template so that the menu displays elements with different Background colors, I've modified the php so that it adds a custom attribute each <li> element in the menu and added the css attribute rules to the css and still its not coloring it. Do you have any idea of what could possibly be happening?
16:14  Jackass4D: oops
16:14  iaj: Jackass4D: which selector selects ALL divs under div#foo ?
16:14  fubhy: danmichel: thats the negative margin approach
16:14  fubhy: danmichel: works on all browsers
16:15  Jackass4D: iaj sorry
16:15  Jackass4D: your right
16:15  fubhy: dakur: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0y&
16:15  fubhy: danmichel: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0y&
16:16  destinydriven: I'd like to get equidistant spacing and padding on the div above the thick footer here: https://stlucianic.org/ how can I accomplish that?
16:16  cromestant: I tested the code + css on a sample page and it works, here in a full joomla deploy, adding the css rules to a file that is loaded, and validating that the changes are done...
16:16  cromestant: and yet no changes in the css
16:17  cromestant: rendering sorry
16:17  Jackass4D: iaj to your solution would just be div#foo p
16:17  danmichel: fubhy: just did what you did. now my sidebar is nowhere to be found
16:17  danmichel: haha
16:17  danmichel: http://stunvisual.com/
16:17  Jackass4D: danmichel
16:18  danmichel: Jackass4D: i need the left to be fluid though
16:18  danmichel: Jackass4D: sup?
16:18  Jackass4D: fluid huh
16:19  iaj: Jackass4D: how owuld I select all ps under that div? 
16:19  danmichel: oops
16:19  danmichel: messed up
16:19  Jackass4D: iaj, just what i just show you
16:20  sriley: iaj: under in in
16:20  sriley: *under or inside (child)
16:21  danmichel: were getting there fubhy Jackass4D
16:21  Jackass4D: sriley all of it
16:21  danmichel: http://stunvisual.com fubhy Jackass4D
16:22  sriley: i meant as in if he was asking for siblings or children
16:22  Jackass4D: nope all of it sriley
16:22  danmichel: fubhy: it works Jackass4D
16:22  danmichel: thanks guys
16:22  Jackass4D: how?
16:22  Jackass4D: dakur
16:22  Jackass4D: how danmichel?
16:22  Jackass4D: negative margin
16:22  danmichel: Jackass4D: the way fubhy said to do it
16:23  danmichel: margins
16:23  danmichel: neg margins
16:23  sriley: thats still didnt really answer my question about what iaj was asking for, under could mean under as in <div id="foo></div><p></p><p></p> etc
16:23  danmichel: Jackass4D: fubhy i wont have ani IE issues with that or anything?
16:23  sriley: then using the decendant selector wont match those under it
16:23  Jackass4D: as fubhy says it
16:23  Jackass4D: i'm only IE8+ fans dakur
16:24  Jackass4D: i'm only IE8+ fans danmichel
16:24  Jackass4D: i already abandoned IE 7
16:24  danmichel: Jackass4D: fubhy is it possible to achieve this kind of stack with just css? http://dannymichel.tumblr.com/ that's what im trying to accomplish
16:27  Jackass4D: danmichel, a rough guess
16:27  Jackass4D: to do that the content sets the height
16:27  Jackass4D: but the width has to be caculate corectly
16:34  danmichel: fubhy: Jackass4D ok, now that i got this, im gonna start from scratch
16:35  sriley: unless im missing something, 4 columns, float left job done for that example

16:44  danmichel: fubhy: yes, i did
16:44  danmichel: thanks
16:44  fubhy: np
16:45  Jackass4D: whats afk short for agaiin?
16:45  neiz: away from keyboard
16:46  fubhy: danmichel: at the oment your sidebar is wrapping to the bottom of the site when you resize your browser window to be smaller than the images on the left side
16:46  fubhy: to fix that you might want to set min-width: SOMETHING on the wrapper
16:46  danmichel: fubhy: i got it. i worked it out, so now im gonna start from scratch
16:46  danmichel: fubhy: it worked
16:47  Jackass4D: so now lets all give it other a hug. should we. :)
16:47  danmichel: haha
16:47  fubhy: ? :P
16:48  fubhy: oh you are redoing the layout
16:48  fubhy: i see
16:48  fubhy: didnt read the stuff above
16:48  fubhy: but u still going for the fluid layout?
16:48  fubhy: u might want to consider a fluid grid system in that case
16:48  fubhy: http://www.spry-soft.com/grids/
16:48  fubhy: check that out
16:48  fubhy: and generate ur very own fluid grid ;)
16:49  Jackass4D: cool fubhy
16:49  fubhy: so when u are redoing it anyways u might aswell consider going the "modern" grid way ;)
16:51  todd: what's wrong with blueprint for that?
16:51  sriley: ohhh most things

17:08  fubhy: Jackass4D: yes what noxxten said is true
17:08  fubhy: Jackass4D: still most sites go for 12 or 16 since too many columns just make it hard to administer

17:10  fubhy: 12 will do in most cases
17:10  fubhy: so u can have 3 columsn of width 4
17:10  fubhy: or 4 of width 3
17:10  fubhy: and so on

17:13  bigcalm: Hi :) I'm having trouble with z-index. http://twitpic.com/3rr6g2 - My menu has the highest z-index, yet a positioned table row appears on top. Any thoughts on what I might be missing?
17:13  Jackass4D: thanks
17:17  fubhy: bigcalm: use position: relative or position: absolute on the element that you want to use z-index on
17:17  fubhy: z-index needs that
17:17  bigcalm: fubhy: they arealdy have position: absolute
17:17  bigcalm: Sorry, I'm using fixed, not absolute
17:22  bigcalm: Maybe I'll take the z-index off of the table row and make the rest of the page z-index: -1
17:23  zamabe: bigcalm, that doesn't play nice with older browsers (negative z-index)
17:23  zamabe: such as firefox 2
17:23  bigcalm: zamabe: This site is only ever used in the latest firefox
17:24  bigcalm: The client didn't want to pay for cross browser support as it's used only by a small team
17:24  obert-: text-shadow should be supported on ie6?
17:24  bigcalm: Which makes this one of the happier projects :)
17:25  iaj: hey there:)
17:25  iaj: can I specify a border-top, border-bottom with one go?
17:25  obert-: border
17:26  bigcalm: iaj: top right bottom left
17:26  bigcalm: Simply removing the z-index from the table row has fixed everything :)
17:27  ScaR__: I know -moz- is for firefox in the CSS, what if I want something specifically for IE?
17:28  iaj: bigcalm: ohh for borders as well
17:28  iaj: neat..!! thanks
17:34  ScaR__: In css, how can I have a line that only applies to IE? I'm dealing with a margin here
17:35  g105b: ScaR__: use conditional comments

18:15  tony23: anyone know how to space text in a sentence automatically so it ends exactly at a certain point?
18:15  ravenzz: try with float instead of display
18:15  kaylee_work: set the width of the container and align: justify?
18:15  kaylee_work: or maybe letter-spacing?
18:16  tony23: like how some sites have text that is aligned perfectly to the margin left and right. or should i do that? is it tacky to read?
18:16  kaylee_work: that's justified alignment
18:16  tony23: thanks
18:16  fubhy: texxt-align: justify
18:16  fubhy: not align: justify
18:17  ravenzz: you are able to use inline-block when your elements will be displaied on a single row
18:17  ravenzz: i suppose
18:17  kaylee_work: well that's what I meant
18:17  ravenzz: so use float:left instead of display:inline-block
18:17  ravenzz: on .fpimage
18:19  Vaerros: tony23, you're trying to make a body of text cut off at a certain point, basically?
18:19  tony23: yes. i know how, just not exactly
18:19  tony23: brb, trying something
18:21  tony23: ok, text-align: justify was what i needed. thanks. though is this recommened for most readers?
18:21  ravenzz: tony23 text-indend
18:21  ravenzz: ?
18:21  tony23: i happen to like it better myself

18:26  tony23: i notice in apache logs, google is caching my server yet it's not in a google search. is it too late to block googlebot?

18:27  ravenz_: put a robots.txt in your root folder
18:28  tony23: yeah, i was aware of that. just wondering if it's too late now since it seems to have cached it
18:31  ravenz_: you can remove your pages from the webmaster tools
18:36  ravenz_: or avoid the view of that pages, placing this piece of js if(top.location!=document.location) top.location=document.location;
18:36  ravenz_: that should work
18:37  ravenz_: sorry location.href="http://google.com";

19:30  Multiply: oojacoboo: Take this example here http://paste2.org/p/1202520 - Imagine the DL's being inline-blocks, with an auto width, and they are in a container, that's 400px wide, for example. When enough categories is added, they'll break to the next line, and line up properly. The problem here, is if one category is wider than the ones on the next line.

19:33  oojacoboo: you just mean with similar widths?
19:33  Multiply: Yeah

20:17  marcuslind: I dont understand, how can width: 900px; be different width in Internet Explorer from Chrome and Firefox?
20:20  Forbidd3n: how would I get a UL to be the size of the children in it
20:20  Forbidd3n: so if an li is small the UL is the same size, if a li is added to the UL and it is longer the UL will expand
20:21  Tempus2: I am not sure if it's allowed but you can try make your ul OR li display: inline
20:26  marcuslind: So I got a box that's 300px height. Then I add padding: 5px to it, so I reduce the height by 10 pixles to 290px.
20:26  marcuslind: but in Internet Explorer, it doesnt seem to add any height, when I use "padding 5px;"
20:26  marcuslind: so when changing to 290px, it gets too short.
20:26  marcuslind: :/
20:27  synchrone: ravenzz ?
20:36  tony22: is "if lte IE 7" still acceptable nomenclature for dealing with IE crap? something's wrong somewhere since my IE specific stylesheet's not being linked
20:37  tony22: followed this link: http://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet doesn't work for me
20:37  tony22: it's just a hobby site, not sure why i care. but bugs the crap out of me
20:37  synchrone: lte means lesser or equal, right ?
20:39  tony22: yes, i'd assume so

20:58  Saiko: my floating divs malfunction when clicked on or control refreshed what gives?
20:59  sriley: iWaffles: which browser, does it support open-quote and close-quote? btw :before is a pseudo-element not pseudo-class

21:00  swiggy: can someone help meh

21:01  swiggy: i have a menu <li>

21:01  swiggy: and i have a border on the right side
21:01  swiggy: that isnt matching up right
21:01  swiggy: so i want it removed if its the last element
21:01  swiggy: how can i assign a class to it?
21:01  swiggy: .mlddm li last
21:01  swiggy: i want the class = "last"
21:02  swiggy: .mlddm li .last {
21:02  swiggy: 		border-style:none;
21:02  swiggy:         }
21:02  swiggy: is that all i need? or do i need to include all the .mlddm li code too?
21:02  swiggy: (the code above it)
21:02  sriley: i think you mean li.last
21:02  swiggy: and just overwrite the border style
21:03 --- Azure|dc is now known as Azure

21:08  grey: ie, .someClass { content: 'foo'; }, Can I style the foo outside of .someClass?
21:09  sriley: no
21:13  systemfault: I never actually understood the point of "content", I'm not sure it's actually CSS's job to play with that.
21:14  grey: systemfault: The case I'm using it for, it's actually quite useful, and purely presentational, I'm using .someClass:before { content: attr(label); } to stick a little note-tag thing beside elements, specifically for a print stylesheet
21:16  systemfault: grey: Ah :)
21:18  grey: sadly though, it means a lot of copying and pasting styles when I want to apply a similar trick to other classes, with slightly different styling

21:34  oojacoboo: etcetera: why not?
21:35  etcetera: well I'm targeting mobile so I'm not sure the browsers will support it?
21:35  oojacoboo: etcetera: most all mobile is webkit engine
21:35  oojacoboo: which will actually support that
21:35  oojacoboo: I mean, safari iOS and chrome Android, is like 85% of the mobile market
21:35  etcetera: yea, not so much.
21:36  oojacoboo: no?

21:37  swiggy: make another*
21:37  oojacoboo: etcetera: that's like 1.1%

21:40 --- karstensrage is now known as Guest23644
21:40  oojacoboo: sriley: surely that's not true
21:40  oojacoboo: why would you use an 8 year old browser in current development
21:41  sriley: tbh ie7 is a very capable browser, supports css gradients, rgba etc
21:41  systemfault: ..
21:41  oojacoboo: yea, but it's still way old
21:41  sriley: just most people conveniently forget that it can do that stuff
21:41  oojacoboo: sriley: that still doesn't explain my question
21:41  oojacoboo: basically, I am calling bullshit on your statement
21:42  sriley: there are a number of articles, for example http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-phone-7-browser-is-based-on-internet-explorer-7
21:42  systemfault: Good for you, it's still a bad browser though.
21:43 --- felcom_ is now known as felcom
21:43  sriley: systemfault: and why is that?
21:43  systemfault: Because it doesn't support CSS2.1?
21:43  sriley: like...
21:43  oojacoboo: sriley: my guess it's it's 8 with some things stripped out of it for better optimization
21:43  oojacoboo: since 9 isn't final
21:44  oojacoboo: that was my guess for the only reason they would do that, memory mgt, but I thought the newer phones could handle it for sure :/
21:45  systemfault: Microsoft hates the web as it's the reason of it's downfall.
21:46  oojacoboo: systemfault: don't be ignorant
21:46  systemfault: They're still crying that they invented XMLHttpRequest.
21:46  oojacoboo: comments like that do not do much for you

21:46  systemfault: oojacoboo: Still true though.
21:46  oojacoboo: no, they just didn't place enough resources there b/c it wasn't their primary revenue stream, now they are playing catch up
21:47  oojacoboo: it isn't b/c they hate it
21:47  systemfault: oojacoboo: They hate it because it's "open", they cannot control it.
21:47  oojacoboo: w/e
21:48  oojacoboo: I'm not a MS fan, but that's a delusional comment
21:48  sriley: systemfault: dont let your anti microsoft fanboyism cloud your judgement
21:48  systemfault: I'm not a MS fan either but I don't hate them
21:48  systemfault: sriley: I'm no hater, just telling what I'm seeing
21:49  systemfault: C# for example, is a wonderful language.
21:49  sriley: yet youve not said why ie7 is such a bad browser
21:49  systemfault: sriley: Because it doesn't support CSS2.1
21:49  oojacoboo: systemfault: sounds like you've been drinking too much MG Siegler coolaid
21:49  systemfault: That alone is enough.
21:49  systemfault: sriley: I don't hate IE8.
21:50  sriley: systemfault: no browser supports 2.1 100%, so saying it doesnt support css 2.1 doesnt make much sense
21:50  systemfault: I can do without CSS3 just fine.
21:50  systemfault: ....
21:50  systemfault: sriley: You're that ignorant?
21:50  sriley: no im asking what doesnt it support, just saying 2.1 doesnt really mean a thing
21:51  systemfault: For someone who doesn't know what he's talking about, sure.

21:55  Maritim: IE and FF however does not wrap the paragraph lines, and allow div#content to take up more space than it should
21:55  oojacoboo: Maritim: add overflow: hidden; to div#contentwrapper
21:55  oojacoboo: also...
21:56  Beta2K: I'm having some troubles with a image that I'm repositioning, I've got a product image and a clearance image, I'm putting the clearance image on top of the poduct image like a stamp.  In FF it's fine, in IE the picture is fine, but it appears to be taking up space still below the product picture
21:56  Beta2K: All was fine till I moved this page from a table layout to css
21:56  oojacoboo: Maritim: width: 749px; to div#content
21:57 --- Channel #css was synced in 105 seconds
21:57  Maritim: oojacoboo: the problem is that some of the pages are supposed to have a sidewrapper to the right aswell
21:57  Maritim: which is why I purposely left out the fixed width
21:57  oojacoboo: Maritim: add an extra class on those pages then
21:57  oojacoboo: and change the width to accommodate
21:57  oojacoboo: OR
21:58  Maritim: seems unnecessary when it works flawlessly in chrome..
21:58  oojacoboo: add a wrapper around the div#content and the right column
21:58  oojacoboo: Maritim: if you know so much, then don't ask for help
21:58  Maritim: oojacoboo: that wasn't what I meant at all

22:03  systemfault: (Or they're just people like me who wanted to try it...)
22:03  oojacoboo: that was upgrades

22:06  systemfault: oojacoboo: I never understood why opera isn't more popular... I know it's a good browser (In my personal case, I just found chrome to be better)
22:06  systemfault: Do you think it's because of the past, when it used to be a paid browser?
22:07  oojacoboo: chrome is solid, although, I can't live without firebug

22:17  swiggy: on pageload
22:17  swiggy: b4 its hovered over
22:17  systemfault: swiggy: Hmm, then perhaps you could add the class via javascript
22:18  swiggy: how
22:18  swiggy: its not a class
22:18  welander: why do you want to trigger the :hover on pageload? just reverse it and make the "hover" style on normal and the normal style on :hover if you understand :P
22:18  systemfault: welander: That's also what I understand but seems he wants something more specific :/
22:19  swiggy: i have a jquery function
22:19  swiggy: that creats my menu
22:19  swiggy: from a CSS
22:20  swiggy: and does certain actions, or certain styles
22:20  swiggy: if i set it to a specific class
22:20  swiggy: my function doesnt know that class, or howt o change it back
22:20  swiggy: so if i could set it to the hover "class"
22:20  swiggy: it will know, when its not being hovered, to change it to `normal`
22:21  systemfault: That's where you're losing me...
22:21  systemfault: Just make a style without :hover and it will be its normal state.
22:22  swiggy: ight so im just going to take it
22:23  swiggy: that there is not a way to 'call' the a:hover 'class'
22:23  swiggy: without giving it a specific call on its own?
22:23  swiggy: specific 'class'
22:25  systemfault: swiggy: You really need to think of CSS as a state machine, you can't trigger anything programmatically (AFAIK) without using javascript to add another class
22:25  systemfault: (add/remove)
22:29  etcetera: is there a way to find out where a given element gets its width using firebug
22:29  etcetera: ?
22:30  systemfault: etcetera: Yeah, just right click on it then click inspect element
22:30  systemfault: You should see all styles affecting it.
22:31  etcetera: right but the width is set to auto.
22:31  etcetera: I mean the computed value is auto.
22:31  etcetera: even if I do width 50% !important it doesnt adjust.
22:31  systemfault: What kind of element is that?
22:31  ZombieLoffe: etcetera, then its width is determined by a child. Continue inspecting until you find what element is causing it.
22:31  ZombieLoffe: Or it's inline :F
22:31  systemfault: Yeah :P
22:33  etcetera: no I have width set to 50% important and display set to block !important.

22:47  oksushi: Cryp71c: no
22:47  oksushi: the '#parent1' only apples to #child1, not #child2

22:48  oksushi: #parent1 #child1:hover, #parent1 #child2:hover { blah blah } would be the same though
22:48  Cryp71c: k, yeah.
22:48  oksushi: or, assuming the #child* elements were the same type
22:48  oksushi: #parent1 div:hover {}
22:49  systemfault: Not really CSS-related but... Is it possible that IE7 (don't know for other versions) strip leading whitespaces in a span?
22:50  systemfault: I replace the space with nbsp; and it fixed it :/
22:50  ZombieLoffe: Eh? white-space is always stripped
22:50  oksushi: systemfault: white space will be collapsed into one space
22:50  Cryp71c: systemfault, that's an HTML thing.
22:50  Cryp71c: any amount of whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) is condensed into one space character, unless you use the HTML encoding for space &nbsp;
22:51  Cryp71c: But if you're having to use &nbsp; for your layout to look right, your css is inadequate.
22:51  systemfault: Cryp71c: It's not for the layout
22:51  oksushi: ]css white-space @ systemfault

23:09  mrittman: http://www.townpoints.com/
23:11  oksushi: mrittman: not without saying what the 'problem' is
23:11  mrittman: the #wrapper div has a background image that is showing up "behind" some elements on the page
23:11  mrittman: I need it to show up in front of the 5 dots at the bottom
23:12  mrittman: actually in firebug if you disable z-index on #wrapper, it will fix the problem
23:12  mrittman: but the problem shows up in IE7...
23:13  mrittman: its probably because #wrapper is a parent to the other items...
