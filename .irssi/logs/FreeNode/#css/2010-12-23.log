00:14  SirHenrik: Hmm... why do they call the 3 liquid column layout the "holy grail" ?
00:15  azazul: because there is no such thing
00:15  azazul: all the solutions have issues
00:15  azazul: http://innonesen.se/test/l-6/
00:15  azazul: here is my version  =P
00:16  SirHenrik: Yeh since I am working on a project and I thought of that design and, well, as a developer and not a designer I found it abit challanging xD
00:17  SirHenrik: But what is the problem with your solution azazul?
00:18  azazul: there is an "unholy grail" too .. a <fluid><static><fluid> layout , instead of clasic <static><fluid><static>
00:18  azazul: my version breaks down on scaling in different browsers
00:18  SirHenrik: looks allright in my chrome
00:18  azazul: and it goes tits-up in pre10 opera's
00:19  oksushi: azazul: the usefulness of that layout pattern would be limited at best
00:19  oksushi: http://www.twmagic.com/misc/bb/3cols.xhtml
00:19  azazul: full height =P
00:19  oksushi: fools gold :)
00:20  SirHenrik: My god, browser and resolution compadibility, why couldnt everyone just use the same resolution and browser.
00:20  azazul: and it's sometimes useful when you have very specific background
00:21  azazul: then im not sure what you have been smoking, but , ya know, its rude to not share
00:22  SirHenrik: I'll rather prefer the holy grail and make the content cover the blankspace then the navigation and some other random column.
00:23  azazul: then you need fixed columns , i guess
00:24  SirHenrik: <static><fluid><static>
00:25  SirHenrik: Was thinking of <navigation><content><boxes of site info> or something.
00:25  azazul: solutions have been given
00:25 * azazul takes a nap
00:25  azazul: have a nice evening , sushi
00:26  oksushi: you too azazul
00:26  SirHenrik: Thanks for your version of the holy grail azazul, could take good use of it :)

00:27  SyntaXe: working on something spesific oksushi?
00:28  oksushi: SyntaXe: sure - about 14 simultaneous projects :P
00:28  oksushi: ever tried juggling with chainsaws?
00:28  oksushi: the threat of castration is quite high
00:28  SyntaXe: i guess it whould be easier to juggle chainsaws :3

00:31  SyntaXe: oksushi: Cool, doing good? :)
00:32  oksushi: it pays the bills
00:34  SyntaXe: oksushi: im looking forward to work with development sometime
00:39  fwaokda: does clear: right; work only with images?
00:42  SyntaXe: I though it was supposed to work with diffrent elements, so not only images but also <div></div> for example.
00:43  oksushi: fwaokda: it works to clear an element from any right floated element

01:16  Accelerator: http://pastie.org/1399399 Is this valid?
01:16  Accelerator: (font-face specifically)
01:17  oojacoboo: could you need to close the font-family style line;
01:18  oojacoboo: wouldn't*
01:18  Accelerator: obvious mistake is obvious o_o
01:18  Accelerator: Thank you
01:19  elph: hey guys, i have a header that I have h1 and h2 tags in, with properties -webkit-text-stroke
01:19  elph: when i give the header a border: 2px solid black; line, it removes the text stroke
01:20  oojacoboo: elph: strange... link?
01:20  elph: http://kevinespiritu.com/
01:20  elph: im new to all of this but my guess is that -webkit-text-stroke is like a border, and when i border the parent element it overrides the stroke?
01:20 --- Unknown[NF] is now known as Unknown[OFF]
01:20  oojacoboo: elph: doesn't appear to have any issues here
01:21  elph: you see a stroke around the title/tag?
01:21  oojacoboo: yes
01:21  elph: weird, i dont see it in chrome or mozilla
01:21  elph: i still see the text-shadow
01:21  elph: but the stroke is gone
01:21  oojacoboo: I see both
01:21  elph: could it be cache?
01:22  oojacoboo: I guess it's possible, clear it
01:22  elph: clearing
01:22  oojacoboo: what browser are you using?
01:22  elph: chrome
01:22  elph: and moz
01:22  oojacoboo: version?
01:22  elph: 8.0.552.224
01:22  elph: current
01:22  oojacoboo: same here
01:22  oojacoboo: yep
01:23  elph: refreshing doesnt do anything, weird
01:23  elph: what do you see now?
01:23  oojacoboo: that looks terrible though, anyway
01:23  elph: im just learning this stuff
01:23  elph: i dont really have design experience
01:23  oojacoboo: I see the same thing
01:24 --- Arieh is now known as Arie
01:24  elph: just reset all the css
01:24  elph: start over
01:25  elph: dont really know how to make it look smooth
01:25  elph: and awesome
01:25  oojacoboo: way too much going on
01:25  oojacoboo: you don't need all that
01:25  oojacoboo: it's too heavy
01:25  elph: yea
01:25  elph: got caught up in the tricks
01:25  oojacoboo: also look into using some rgba() instead of a solid opaque color
01:25  robrecord: there is no css at all
01:25  elph: whats the benefit of that oojacoboo
01:26  oojacoboo: alpha layer will help you blend all that crazy shadow stuff
01:26  elph: oh interesting
01:26  elph: transparency value?
01:26  oojacoboo: yes

01:43  Voziv: Hello :), I have an input field that I'm trying to get aligned with an image for a search. The input field for some reason is lower than my images... anyone know what causes that?
01:45  MACscr: Voziv: use vertical-align:middle; on the image
01:45  Voziv: would vertical-align:top; work for the input as well?
01:45  MACscr: no
01:50  willmarshall: Any handy CSS 3 properties that will let me capitalize the first letter in an element?
01:50  Voziv: MACscr: thanks, had to do vertical-align: middle on the input field as well to get it to behave in ie as well as chrome :)
01:54  qq99: willmarshall, text-transform:capitalize or something like that
01:54  willmarshall: qq99: Applies to all words, not just the first
01:54  willmarshall: No good :(
01:54  qq99: ohh
01:55  qq99: sorry
01:58  elph: what if you put the first word within a tag
01:58  elph: and had a class for it
01:58  elph: or is that too much extra markup
01:58  SuitCase_: willmarshall: p:first-letter { }
01:58  willmarshall: SuitCase_: Cheers
01:59  willmarshall: elph: Too much extra markup :(
01:59  bcessa: hi there, I'm having problems when a very long continuous string is breaking my layout, I notice using word-wrap: break-word; works but not in every browser, any ideas on how can I fix this isssue?
01:59  SuitCase_: css3 so it might not work everywhere, you should look it up
01:59  willmarshall: SuitCase_: I know
01:59  willmarshall: Luckily it's an intranet for Firefox 3.5+
01:59  willmarshall: And this is progressive enhancement anyway
02:00  SuitCase_: i feel so stupid asking this but what is the solution to the IE6\IE7 bug where an inline (horizontal) <ul> cascades down and to the right? the exact bug i'm trying to fix can be seen in the div#comicnav_homepage on www.bittersweetcandybowl.com
02:00  elph: what about p{text-transform:capitalize}
02:00  SuitCase_: i know there's some extra attribute you need to set but i forgot it and can't remember it
02:00  elph: that would get the first letter of each p tag right
02:00  SuitCase_: elph: that would capitalise all letters in all <p> elements
02:01  elph: Oh It Would Be Like This ?
02:01  qq99: html,body both have min-height / min-width 100%, only html node shows up as covering the entire viewable area in firebug, hovering over body shows nothing at all, any logic reason for this?
02:01  SuitCase_: elph: yeah
02:02  SuitCase_: selecting the first letter can be done with css3 or an ugly <span class="firstletter">
02:02  bcessa: no ideas?
02:02  elph: this guy did it here
02:02  elph: http://www.geekgumbo.com/2010/04/25/capitalize-the-first-letter-of-a-paragraph-with-css/
02:02  SuitCase_: bcessa: write horrible code to manually insert spaces in long strings?
02:03  SuitCase_: that's what i did when coding a forum where people kept writing stupid long words
02:03  bcessa: :( guess there's no choice, thnx
02:03  SuitCase_: you could also do that overflow-scrolly stuff that makes things ugly
02:07  elph: span class = firstletter would be bad because it just adds a ton of extra markup right?
02:07  SuitCase_: ah i found the solution to my problem. some site calls it the staircase bug. you have to apply float:left to the <li> instead of the element inside the <li> for IE to properly arrange the horizontal list
02:07  SuitCase_: elph: yeah. to be honest i wouldn't mind it if it was in some intro paragraph or something
02:08  SuitCase_: but if it's done like 20 times per document it's ugly
02:08  elph: well yea the first letter would be cool
02:08  elph: of a post
02:08  elph: im gonna do that right now and tet
02:08  elph: test*
02:10  qq99: does min-height not need a parent ele with a height?
02:10  qq99: things are very odd in my page
02:11  elph: if i only want 3 sides of an element bordered, is there a mroe efficient way to do it than typeing border-top, border-left, border-right
02:11  SuitCase_: elph: border: 1px solid red; border-bottom: none;
02:11  SuitCase_: or something like that
02:11  elph: ah yea good idea
02:12  elph: thanks :)
02:17  asfahaan: hi . http://asfahaan.tasmanit.com/client/kwa/takepu.html how do i remove the space which is coming between the image? its in a table
02:18  elph: this chris coyier dude is awesome
02:18  elph: so helpful
02:20  qq99: anyone up to do some debugging on some phantom spacing coming from somewhere in my layout?  there's just a bit of annoying scrollbars that COULD be hidden by overflow:hidden, but I'd rather figure out the problem
02:21  qq99: the site in question has 2 layouts, each with an issue, http://anthonycameron.com/personal/index.html if it piques your interest
02:23  qq99: problem seems to be only in FF
02:24  elph: why would you put that you ddon'tbelieve in a god on your design website
02:24  elph: seems like something that would never help and only hurt getting client leads from teh site if they did happen to read that
02:25  qq99: yeah it's old text
02:25  qq99: I've got a lot of complaints about that
02:26  qq99: I'll fix the copy after I get the layout working
02:27  elph: wish i could help but i'm too noob atm
02:29  qq99: oh! the box-shadow is adding to the height lol
02:29  qq99: no wonder >.>
02:30  elph: i ddon'treally need a comp sci degree to be a designer for clients do i
02:31  CuriosTiger: A comp sci degree isn't going to teach you web design
02:31  elph: i mean if i just build from noobish people who need really simple designs, and work my way up my portfolio should be pretty solid id imaginee
02:31  CuriosTiger: so it's probably pretty irrelevant whether you have a gree
02:31  CuriosTiger: a degree
02:31  elph: and i should be able to get business from there
02:31  CuriosTiger: Sure, if you can compete with all the other people that do the same thing
02:31  CuriosTiger: my impression is that it's a lot of work for low pay, since there's so much competition.
02:32  CuriosTiger: you have to be really exceptional in order to charge high rates for your work.
02:32  elph: yea i don't really plan to have it be my sole income source
02:32  elph: what i'm experienced in is marketing and seo, so if i could do the design work as well it would be helpful
02:33 * CuriosTiger is immediately skeptical of people doing SEO
02:33  elph: i don't really do the black hat spammy sort of stuff
02:33  qq99: you def don't need a CS degree for this, but it can only help
02:33  CuriosTiger: Even the white hat stuff skews search results
02:33  elph: so far i've just helped local businesses just have a presence online
02:33  CuriosTiger: usually towards something I'm not interested in
02:33  elph: well yea, that's kind of the purpose
02:34  CuriosTiger: Which is why I dislike the entire concept, even if you manage to stay within the confines of the ground rules laid down by Google et al
02:34  CuriosTiger: I believe the web should be a meritocracy
02:34  elph: well i mean, technically anything you do online with yoru own site could be considered SEO
02:34  elph: writing a blog post is seo
02:34  CuriosTiger: I disagree.
02:35  CuriosTiger: Writing a blog post is providing contents
02:35  elph: content is a core of seo
02:35  CuriosTiger: getting 50 other bloggers to exchange links with you for no reason other than to boost pagerank is SEO
02:35  elph: that doesn't really work well anyways, the link exchange
02:35  CuriosTiger: elph: Then why are most sites that employ SEO techniques so pathetically devoid of useful content?
02:35  elph: quality content is always going to rule
02:35  CuriosTiger: Not anymore, because it got abused.
02:36  elph: well sure, i definitely am with you on that
02:36  elph: a lot of the people promoting sites are spun 200x, scraped articles blah blah
02:36  elph: those sorts of tricks dow ork and can provide short term income/etc but they'll never be real web assets imo
02:37  CuriosTiger: I am actually gonna be putting up a small web site for my consulting business soon-ish
02:37  elph: what kind of consulting do you do?
02:37  CuriosTiger: network engineering, UNIX and windows sysadmin
02:37  elph: all stuff i know nothing about
02:37  elph: haha
02:38  CuriosTiger: My SEO plans are to put a link to my web site in my email signature
02:38  CuriosTiger: and print it on my business cards.
02:38  elph: that'll work
02:38  elph: lol
02:38  CuriosTiger: It'll work for my purposes
02:38  elph: i mean
02:38  elph: for stuff like that
02:38  CuriosTiger: I don't need to be the first hit on google for "network engineering"
02:39  elph: if you wanted to like 'SEO' it, youd probably domain 'geographiclocationbusinesstype.com'
02:39  CuriosTiger: except my geographic location is "world"
02:39  elph: its not like organic search results are going to be the thign that drive your leads
02:39  elph: you know
02:39  qq99: I get a lot of leads from linkedin
02:39  CuriosTiger: No, my leads are mostly prior business contacts
02:39  qq99: though most are hiring agencies.. :(
02:39  CuriosTiger: people I've done work for through past employers
02:39  elph: you could just have links to your site on all of your personal sites
02:40  CuriosTiger: who liked my work and want to keep using me
02:40  elph: facebook, twitter, linkedin, whtever you might have
02:40  CuriosTiger: I'll do linkedin. Won't bother with facebook. I like to keep work and personal a tad separate
02:40  elph: yea
02:41  elph: it'd be nice if you could throw a link on your clients sites but your business doesn't really warrant that i'd think
02:41  CuriosTiger: but before I even worry about that, I need to come up with a site design that doesn't suck.
02:41  CuriosTiger: Well, as you pointed out, that doesn't do much anyway. And most corporations don't exactly like to publish lists of all their contractors.
02:41  CuriosTiger: which I can understand.
02:42  elph: yea, it wouldn't be a good option
02:42  elph: im working on a site for my stuff too, i think im just going to go with something simple
02:42  CuriosTiger: I'm not too worried. It's a part-time thing, and right now, I have more work than I can handle.
02:42  CuriosTiger: Which is why I just set up an LLC and am trying to do this professionally
02:42  CuriosTiger: still, a tech company does need SOME kind of web presence.
02:43  CuriosTiger: even if it's just an intro page and a contact form
02:43  elph: just a basic website id say
02:43  elph: like homepage with some solid copy, your background or portfolio, and a contact form
02:44  CuriosTiger: I also want to redo my personal web site
02:44  CuriosTiger: but in a different style than the corp one
02:44  elph: yea my personal site is what i'm currently working on
02:44  elph: its just going to be ridiculous ithink
02:45  CuriosTiger: http://www.bigrig.org/ is mine
02:45  CuriosTiger: although I took the links section on the top away recently because I'm unhappy with the content
02:45  elph: 404
02:45  elph: weird
02:45  elph: doesn't work w/o www
02:46  elph: i just got a wordpress blank theme
02:46  elph: http://kevinespiritu.com/
02:46  elph: so my site looks hilariously bad
02:47  CuriosTiger: I know it doesn't work without www
02:47  CuriosTiger: that's why I put www in the URL
02:47  elph: why is that?
02:47  CuriosTiger: it doesn't even give you a 404 -- "bigrig.org" does not even resolve.
02:47  CuriosTiger: it's because I have this philosophical belief that a hostname and a domain name are two different tings
02:48  CuriosTiger: things
02:48  elph: why don't you just redirect to the www
02:48  elph: despite your belief
02:48  CuriosTiger: Now, I will not be that anal with the corporate domain. There, faciliating laziness is more important. But on my personal site, I do things my way.
02:48  CuriosTiger: elph: Principle.
02:48  elph: haha alright then
02:48  elph: fair enough
02:48  elph: idk if i'd call it facilitating laziness
02:49  elph: rather call it promoting efficiency
02:56  qq99: you guys know if wordpress will accept a 100% custom template?
02:56  qq99: like basically just their service putting divs into my template
02:56  qq99: so much material on the web it's hard to verify just how customizable it is
02:56  JDigital: ask #wordpress
02:58  qq99: JDigital, good idea, thanks
02:58  qq99: oh, I meant g blogger
03:06  elph: hey for guys using windows: what do you use to edit code?

03:31  cpgo: don't know how to word this, so heres a bit of css: div#register-box form input[type=text], div#register-box form input[type=password]
03:31  cpgo: is there a way to combine the two selectors, or it has to be this way?
03:33  oksushi: cpgo: that is how you would select both. If you didn't care about excluding other types of input, you could just use div#register-box form input {}
03:34  cpgo: right, I just need these two however
03:34  cpgo: thanks

04:10  zezikaro: I need to have a border on the bottom of every element, APART from the last one
04:10  zezikaro: is that possible?
04:10  zezikaro: or will i have to assign a class to all of those that need a border
04:29  Goddard: how do i float a div to the right in a table without making the cell expand to as big as the image
04:30  Goddard: the image thats in the div
04:37  oksushi: Goddard: url to the page?
04:37  Goddard: huh?
04:37  oksushi: Goddard: the url to the page displaying the issue
04:37  oksushi: see the /topic
04:38  Goddard: imagen a table and inside that table is a cell but its small maybe 10px high and i have a div that needs to be 20px high i want the cell to stay the same size without increasing the table cell to 20px
04:38  oksushi: zezikaro: div {border-top: 1px solid #333;} div:last-child {border: none;}
04:38  oksushi: Goddard: make a testcase. http://www.webdevout.net/test is good for that
04:38  oksushi: so you can show what you are putting inside the table
04:39  Goddard: a div
04:39  oksushi: …
04:39  Goddard: with a image inside it
04:39  Goddard: the image is 20px high
04:39  oksushi: come back with a proper testcase
04:39  Goddard: oksushi: wow are you serious?
04:40  oksushi: how about you waste more time 'describing' your problem using english, when HTML would make a buttload more sense, and save us both time?
04:40  Goddard: ur a moron
04:40  oksushi: no u
04:40  Goddard: <table><tr><td><div><img>
04:40  Goddard: get it?
04:41  oksushi: I get that you’re a pretty lazy-ass help-seeker
04:41  Goddard: i help people all the time i dont ask them to do a butt load of work for something so simple
04:41  Goddard: like if some one asked me how do you do windows update
04:41  Goddard: then ask them to describe it in a different language because its funner
04:42 * oksushi hands Goddard a cookie
04:42  oksushi: now go and make a testcase
04:42  Goddard: oksushi: slaps oksushi
04:42  Goddard: there is no test case twit I just gave it to you
04:43  oksushi: Goddard: make one using http://www.webdevout.net/test. And stop being obstinate
04:43  oksushi: there are protocols in here

04:43  oksushi: ]testcase @ Goddard
04:43  _ZofBot4: Goddard, testcase: a single page (or set of pages) that describes and isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styles, and scripting
04:43  Goddard: its so simple I dont need an entire page
04:43  Goddard: just one line or even an explination
04:43  Goddard: <table><tr><td><div><img>
04:43  oksushi: if it's so simple, why do you need help with it?
04:44  oksushi: anyway, this is getting tiresome
04:44  Goddard: because i would rather get a quick answer than google all day
04:44  oksushi: so go and make a page, or go elsewhere
04:44  Goddard: oksushi: damn how does it feel to be gay
04:44  oksushi: you thinking of telling your parents?
04:45  Goddard: oksushi: so you take it in the ass right?
04:45  Goddard: or the mouth?

05:05  qq99: does a media query changing the active stylesheet fire any kind of detectable event?
05:05  qq99: that I might use for js purposes
05:06  oksushi: sounds like a question for ##javascript
05:06  qq99: thanks, I'll try there too
05:09  qq99: I suppose the media query itself is tracking resize events

06:42  Accelerator: From what I've been taught
06:42  Accelerator: It really doesn't make two craps worth a difference as far as I know though.

07:35  Thomas_Bates: Anyone here have a guess at why a reset.css would negate HTML tags?

07:40 --- okaycool_ is now known as okaycool
07:42  cpgo: schwarzes: line-height
07:55  Thomas_Bates: Can someone in here take a quick look at the reset and rebuild.css files I'm using and make sure there is nothing off about them? I can't seem to get html tags to work properly, despite rebuild.css.
07:56  Thomas_Bates: http://pastebin.com/NCnWg9s2 <--- rebuild.css http://pastebin.com/3v5z7u1f <--- reset.css
07:57  elph: css3 has some awesome stuff in it man
07:57  elph: so cool
07:57 * Thomas_Bates is just beginning to learn CSS
07:58  elph: what is your question here
07:59  elph: Thomas_Bates
07:59  Thomas_Bates: Well
08:00  Thomas_Bates: For some reason, HTML tags are not functioning, after reset/rebuild.css has been processed
08:00  elph: as in your webpages don't work?
08:00  Thomas_Bates: They're being ignored completely, they show up in the source, and the text appears, but the effects aren't rendered.
08:00  elph: what is your site
08:01  Thomas_Bates: No, the effects of the tags don't take effect. For instance, <em></em> doesn't produce italics
08:01  Thomas_Bates: Its on a local test server, not viewable :/
08:01  elph: pastebin?
08:01  Thomas_Bates: What do you want me to show you?
08:01  elph: the markup of the page that is having problems
08:02  Thomas_Bates: It is site-wide
08:02  Thomas_Bates: http://pastebin.com/6Zq3MeZD
08:02  Thomas_Bates: Correction, bold/italics do take effect
08:02  fwaokda: is there an easy way to have a div keep the space to it's right cleared? So that everything else set to float: left; after it is put under it?
08:02  Thomas_Bates: actually it looks like only headers are having issues, sorry
08:02  elph: so what is not taking effect then?
08:03  richardwhiuk: Thomas_Bates: that doesn't use reset or rebuild.css
08:03  elph: i think clear:both works fwaokda
08:03  elph: http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_clear.asp
08:03  Thomas_Bates: ...
08:03  elph: rich is right, it is referencing just style.css
08:03  Thomas_Bates: hm
08:04  elph: i think you can edit style.css to call the other css files, right?
08:04  Thomas_Bates: yes
08:04  elph: i am not 100% on that
08:04  fwaokda: elph, well but if there is a div to the left then it throws it under that too. I have one div to the far left and then I want the other three divs I have to appear as individual rows to the right of that one of the far left.
08:04  elph: how about large margins
08:04  Thomas_Bates: What am I needing to do? There is nothing in style.css regarding any other HTML tags, so I'm not sure why headings would take effect
08:04  richardwhiuk: yes, you can use @impoer
08:05  Thomas_Bates: Just define the heading classes?
08:05  richardwhiuk: *@import
08:05  richardwhiuk: fwaokda: paste please
08:05  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, ok on second
08:06  Thomas_Bates: style.css calls upon reset, rebuild, 2c-l, and several fonts already, I'm ok with importing, I just do not know for certain what to do
08:06  elph: so your problem is that h1-h6 tags are not functioning the way the rebuild.css says they should?
08:06  Thomas_Bates: Yes
08:07  elph: look @ your rebuild.css file
08:07  elph: there is no defined size for them?
08:07  elph: just says font-weight: normal; clear: both;
08:07  Thomas_Bates: hm
08:08  elph: http://pastebin.com/R6tdyS7r
08:08  elph: try that
08:08  elph: just take the hx stuff though i guess
08:08  elph: i ran into this problem earlier today when i was learning about resets
08:08  Thomas_Bates: ah
08:09  Thomas_Bates: Cool, thanks!
08:09  elph: you have to re-give them the sizes a browser automatically gives them
08:09  elph: but you get to customize what those sizes are
08:09  Thomas_Bates: I was using this from a project code page, I'm rather shocked this hasn't been caught
08:09  Thomas_Bates: Ah alright, thanks for the help
08:09  elph: let me know if that works
08:09  elph: im super new to css
08:09  elph: like a week or so
08:09  Thomas_Bates: I'm only a few days in, it worked :)
08:09  elph: cool
08:09  Thomas_Bates: Yeah, I like it so far, just some odd errors
08:10  elph: i am learning html5/css2.1/3 and php
08:10  elph: and 'taking notes' by hand coding a site as i go
08:10  elph: adding stuff i learn along the way
08:10  Thomas_Bates: I'm making a WordPress template, trying to get a basis of CSS before I hand code something different
08:10  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, http://pastebin.com/m2zCpFcX -- The img#spotlight is the thing to the far left, then I was trying to get div#heading, div#features, div#description to appear as their own rows to the right of img#spotlight.  IDK if it matters but I'm also trying to have the design where it extends all the way to the right hand side of the screen.
08:11  elph: yea i am working on my personal wp theme as well
08:11  Thomas_Bates: Nice :)
08:11  elph: i got starkers wp theme, and am building out from there
08:11  elph: its essentially like a reset but for wordpress
08:11  Thomas_Bates: Ah, I used a tutorial to construct from scratch, fairly c/p work
08:12  elph: whose?
08:12  elph: i may have seen the same
08:12  Thomas_Bates: I was just able to call on some fonts and that was my first major step in CSS, if you would consider that a "major" step
08:12  elph: i have a tutsplus year subscription which is really helping me learn faster
08:12  Thomas_Bates: http://themeshaper.com/wordpress-themes-templates-tutorial/
08:13  elph: there is a better one, ithink
08:13  elph: a video one
08:13  Thomas_Bates: I dislike video tuts
08:13  Thomas_Bates: Very rarely do I use them, unless I'm working on a Blender Project
08:14  elph: ah ok, wont link then
08:33  elph: im getting too into the design stuff
08:33  elph: haha
08:33  Thomas_Bates: lol
08:33  Thomas_Bates: I'm experimenting
08:33  Thomas_Bates: I like it so far

08:41  elph: Thomas_Bates
08:41  Thomas_Bates: hm?
08:41  Thomas_Bates: ah
08:42  Thomas_Bates: I don't use photoshop, I'm all Open Source over here
08:42  Thomas_Bates: ArchLinux, Chromium, GIMP, Bluefish
08:42  Thomas_Bates: using a LAMPP test server
08:42  Thomas_Bates: Right now I'm trying to get the blog title and its description to roll into a clickable image
08:43  Thomas_Bates: brb, restroom/tea
08:43  elph: i have nfi how to do linux anything
08:45  Thomas_Bates: lol
08:45  Thomas_Bates: ArchLinux starts you off from the terminal, and you build from there
08:46  Thomas_Bates: I started with Ubuntu though, back in its version 8 days
08:47  elph: its too scary
08:47  elph: what is the benefit
08:47  Thomas_Bates: ROFL
08:47  Thomas_Bates: Too many to count
08:47  Thomas_Bates: You can do quite literally anything to the computer you want with linux
08:47  Thomas_Bates: Windows, you cannot, it is quite restrictive.
08:49  elph: what are things you would want to do to your comp that windows wont let youd o?
08:50  Thomas_Bates: It would be easier if you asked that
08:50  Thomas_Bates: I've not used Windows for a very long time
08:50  Thomas_Bates: I can change the appearence and organization of anything
08:50  Thomas_Bates: But that is really just a starter
08:51  elph: what kind of learning curve is there
08:51  Thomas_Bates: ah
08:52  Thomas_Bates: That is subjective to what distrobution you use.
08:52  Thomas_Bates: And there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different distrobutions.
08:52  Thomas_Bates: Most beginners use Debian, OpenSUSE, or Ubuntu
08:52  Thomas_Bates: Ubuntu has an excellent learning curve
08:52  elph: whatever is easiest honestly
08:52  Thomas_Bates: That would probably be Ubuntu
08:52  elph: i dont want to consider something hard just because its hard
08:54  Thomas_Bates: Arch and Gentoo are considered the most advanced
08:54  Thomas_Bates: But they're also the most well documented
08:55  richardwhiuk: lol
08:55  richardwhiuk: Arch maybe
08:55  richardwhiuk: Gentoo is just wrong
08:55  fwaokda: Can anyone take a look at this and tell me how to get the img#spotlight on the far left while having the div's #heading, #features, and #description as their own rows to the right of img#spotlight? http://pastebin.com/m2zCpFcX
08:55  Thomas_Bates: hm?
08:56  richardwhiuk: LFS is the most technical
08:56  Thomas_Bates: I've not used Gentoo much,
08:56  richardwhiuk: it sucks.
08:56  Thomas_Bates: rofl
08:57  richardwhiuk: fwaokda: you mind using absolute positioning?
08:58  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, well kinda new to css whats the disadvantange to it?
08:58  richardwhiuk:  the easiest way is to add another div around #heading, features and description
08:58  elph: in his css, does he have to write div#heading
08:58  elph: or img#spotlight
08:58  elph: can't he just do #spotlight, #heading
08:58  richardwhiuk: fwaokda: it's not flexible to the content
08:58  richardwhiuk: elph: you can just write #heading
08:59  elph: cool, ty
08:59  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, well I was wanting it to be where it goes all the way to the right. I guess I would want it flexible
08:59  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, if i need to add another div around the three divs that'd be fine
09:01  Thomas_Bates: hm, I need to take the #blog-title and #blog-description and roll them into an image :/
09:02  richardwhiuk: fwaokda: something like http://pastebin.com/fC7zm16g should do
09:02  richardwhiuk: essentially use two divs to create the two columns
09:03  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, alright thanks alot :)
09:11  fwaokda: richardwhiuk, depending on how large the browser window is maximize there can end up being alot of whitespace between the left col and right col.  I could just play with the percentages but is there a better way of doing it?

14:26  atan: I need to make a nested list except it needs to act more like a table as it holds table data. Any suggestions on how I might best do this? Should I just use <ul>s and then set widths to %?
14:26  JDigital: if it's a table of data use a table
14:29  ZombieLoffe: Indeed.
14:32  atan: JDigital, but err. I need to have sub-items that are indented
14:32  JDigital: that sounds like a job for list, then.
14:32  atan: List it is. ^_^ ty

14:42  matt__: awww
14:42  matt__: Wiz_KeeD: very nice and all that, esp at this time of year
14:43  matt__: im off to throw up...
14:43  Wiz_KeeD: esp?
14:43  matt__: eh?
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: esp at this time of year?
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: aaa
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: especially
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: sorry
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: is there such thing as .bla[class]
14:44  Wiz_KeeD: in css?
14:44  matt__: dunno sorry
14:45  JDigital: what do you mean
14:47  elpolilla: Wiz_KeeD: that would select any element with the 'bla' class plus any value in the 'class' attribute (which will always be true since the element has at least the 'bla' class)
14:47  elpolilla: so using that makes no sense
14:47  Wiz_KeeD: aaahh
14:47  Wiz_KeeD: i understand now
14:47  Wiz_KeeD: so if i do #div[class]
14:47  Wiz_KeeD: an element with id of div wich has at least one class?

15:01  matt__: min-height
15:09  Wiz_KeeD: I used the [class] selector to prevent IE6 from reading the PNG file
15:09  Wiz_KeeD: so he says
15:09  schwarzes: thanks matt
15:09  ZombieLoffe: schwarzes: background images don't stretch...
15:11  ZombieLoffe: schwarzes: Reduce the line-height of the menu items that break into two lines
15:11  schwarzes: why are some menu items going below the box
15:11  schwarzes: ok zombie thanks
15:11  ZombieLoffe: because they're breaking line, because there's not enough width
15:12  schwarzes: that was my next question
15:12  schwarzes: thanks
15:12  schwarzes: which class do i need to edit or add that code
15:14  ZombieLoffe: #nav .sf-menu a {} selects all menu items. If you want to target any item specifically, give it a certain class and use that class to select it...

16:22  muszek: hi... I have a table with border-spacing: 1px; (1px of free space in between td's).  The problem is that I need that space to have a different color for thead (is dark) and tbody (white) and apparently background-color of <table> is responsible for it (I can't override it with thead's or tr's background color).  Is there anything I can do?  vide: http://bp.bobek.muszek.com:37080/pl/table/muszek\

16:55  dptth: hey all i was wondering if some one could explain how ie6 alpha filter works under the hood. Or just how filters work in gneral under the hood. Im trying to track down a bug on my site that cause the server to crash after spawing infinte httpd processes. I know that the problem is related to this filter because when i remove it there is no issue. I think its possible that there is a 404 with the blank gif but im just wondering if that would caus
16:55  dptth: does anyone have any information on this
16:56  dptth: i can provide more info if that helps
16:57  richardwhiuk: the server to crash?
16:57  dptth: yup
16:57  richardwhiuk: filters are client side
16:57  dptth: thats what i thought
16:58  dptth: but i have a javascript bit that changes the dispay and cycles through the elements and changes their display
16:58  dptth: so im wondering if it has to call the server again each time it changes the display
16:59  dptth: or if it never has to do any thing with the server im wondering why there is suck high load on the server
16:59  Aragon: dptth, javascript and display (css rendering) are both clientside, i couldnt imagine that would crash your server
16:59  dptth: im running centos 5.5
16:59  dptth: and its a repeatable process
17:00  dptth: i have 2 machines that are being taken down
17:00  Aragon: dptth, when you use ajax (reloading only the content) each query does a query
17:00  Aragon: maybe you have something that requests endless new pages
17:00  dptth: that seems like what is happening
17:00  Aragon: but acctually this is no css related question :D maybe you try #httpd or ##javascript
17:00  dptth: but there is nothing wrong when i take the filter our
17:01  dptth: yea im checking there next
17:01  dptth: just wanted to make sure that the filter didn't need to query the server at all when it worked
17:01  Aragon: okay, good luck ;)
17:01  dptth: thanks for the help

17:03  Lurzino: why when I apply to <a> an color: red; then I apply to a:visited the previous color but once I pass again over the <a> the hover doesn't work anymore... .why?
17:03  Aragon: Lurzino, set a:hover {}
17:04  Lurzino: Aragon, yes, I did.... look: .menu a { font-weight: 100; } .menu a:hover { text-decoration:none; color: red; } .menu a:visited { color: #014BA0; }
17:05  Lurzino: but when I pass again over visited it doesnt change again to red
17:06  richardwhiuk: Lurzino: test link? it always works for me
17:06  malteserface: have you tried setting a color before it's hovered in? .menu a { font-weight: 100; }
17:07  richardwhiuk: also, you want to use a:link, not a
17:07  Aragon: Lurzino, http://www.webdevout.net/test?0q works for me

20:54  istevenmon: i think with css3 there is an option for that

22:09  Hail_Spacecake: and I'd like the <nav> element specifically to ignore that padding
22:10  Hail_Spacecake: so it nicely touches the border of the outer <div> without being padded the same way the text is
22:10  Hail_Spacecake: is there a way to do this?
22:14  foo: http://jsfiddle.net/urvJf/1/ - anyone know why changing the font-size changes the height on the nav?
22:19 --- PM|offline is now known as PM|online
22:24  tumbler: foo, you want the font to get closer to the border when it gets bigger?
22:26  foo: tumbler: if I remove the font-size, the height of the whole nav gets larger. why is that?
22:26  ocf: prob stupid answer, as usual. http://www.kloudmash.com/mashwarelive/mesportsgrill/ - why aren't those 3 fb posts floating?
22:26  openstandards: Is it possible to set a container div with max-width and min-width and get make 5 <li> expand and contract to the size of the container without using the use of js?
22:28  tumbler: foo, http://jsfiddle.net/urvJf/20/ - very strange. tried rejigging it but still same problem
22:29  foo: tumbler: thank you, that's what I thought. I was wondering if there is something I don't know or what. PS. another problem (if interested :)) is is this ok: http://jsfiddle.net/urvJf/1/ - notice the markup isn't really "proper" - but I can't think of a way to get it to look the same and still have each nav item completely clickable. hmmm
22:30  openstandards: i worked out a solution not sure how well it will work but i'll see in a bit
22:31  tumbler: foo, when does this become a problem? do you want to vary the font size at some point?

22:32  foo: tumbler: hm, the former question, yes - want to make the font smaller
22:34  tumbler: http://jsfiddle.net/urvJf/34/
22:34  tumbler: the box will grow because any height is just a minimum guideline (atleast when you do it this way) but that version stays the same size when the font shrinks on mine
22:36  tumbler: to have them truly independant I'd start from scratch without using table elements
22:37  foo: tumbler: interesting, what did you change? I don't see any changes in the height, unless it's just doing it in li.nav ?
22:38  tumbler: foo, is that what you wanted?
22:38  _bogus_: hey ! how can i put a div over another div using css ? they are brother elements, not father-son
22:38  tumbler: I didnt change much tbh
22:39  foo: tumbler: yeah, oh. haha, strange.
22:39  tumbler: http://jsfiddle.net/urvJf/37/ - there's a nice clean version :P
22:40  ocf: v37 ... :)
22:40  tumbler: _bogus_ example? :)
22:40  ocf: prob stupid answer, as usual. http://www.kloudmash.com/mashwarelive/mesportsgrill/ - why aren't those 3 fb posts floating?
22:40  foo: tumbler: ahh! looks like I need to define height in the li and not the #nav
22:40  foo: now to make the full li clickable
22:41  foo: well, I have it, but that's probably not the best way
22:42  ocf: _bogus_ - set the parent div to position:relative, then to layer one div on top of another, use position: absolute on one of the divs. It'll remove it from document flow & allow you to position it 'on top of' another

23:37  alpha^: How do I change the height of a <select>?
23:38  azazul: in IE's ? .. you dont
23:41  alpha^: azazul, Hm I don't much care about IE, but I suppose I shouldn't code around it. How would I change (if there is a standard way) <select> to show more than one row?
23:42  azazul: it seems that what you really need is a replacement for <select> tag
23:43  azazul: it will require JS , with a fallback to unaltered <select>
23:47  qom2: have you tried mediawiki azazul?
