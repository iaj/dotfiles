00:36  b1lly: somasin: btw, that height and lineheight fixed the trick, however on the older version of ie, it drops the floatted elements to the next line
00:36  b1lly: instead of showing everything on the same line
00:37  p3lim: anyone?

00:40  evilaim: Hey guys
00:41  p3lim: thanks boogyman 
00:42  p3lim: can I add class/id to <img>?
00:42  boogyman: yes
00:43  evilaim: Nice
00:43  evilaim: I figured it out as I joined here
00:43  evilaim: haha
00:44  boogyman: evilaim: now you just need to figure out how to compose a thought without abusing the <enter> key
00:44  evilaim: I need to figure out how to not come on IRC.  I think my gf is gunna break up with me cause I'm addicted to this ELITE game.
00:45  evilaim: Multiplayer Notepad for the WIN!
00:52  graphitemaster: evilaim, just fuck her really well and she'll not leave you
00:52  evilaim: lol
00:52  evilaim: I'm WAY too lazy for that
00:52  evilaim: 3 minutes for the winner!?
00:53  graphitemaster: way to lazy to have sex?
00:53  oksushi: *weiner
00:53  graphitemaster: OMFG if I had a gf right now, I would fuck this shit out of her and make her bleed
00:54 * oksushi wonders why, with an attitude like that, graphitemaster does not have a woman in his(?) life
00:54  p3lim: boogyman: it got really messed up: http://p3lim.tumblr.com/post/1509205516
00:54  graphitemaster: I have had many women in my life
00:55  oksushi: if you say so
00:55  graphitemaster: I just can't stand staying with one of them, when I want them all
00:56  boogyman: p3lim: please re-read my example, noting the multiple sets of rules for their respective selector(s)
01:01  p3lim: boogyman: ok, I fixed most of it now, though the list elements are positioned at the top (visit the same link to see the changes), while I want them on the bottom like the picture
01:02  boogyman: `css vertical-align
01:02  rivvles: CSS 'vertical-align' property: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align
01:06  p3lim: boogyman: and apply that to .list-horizontal?
01:08  boogyman: to the appropriate list-item (li) not the (ul) so ul li {vertical-align:baseline}
01:09  evilaim: So, are rounded corners complex?
01:09  mikedoty: I have a div that I don't know the height of beforehand.  I want to have a line extending from the right side of this box exactly halfway down.  What would be a good way to accomplish that?
01:09  evilaim: They do seem very weird to me on the style of getting them
01:10  oksushi: complex in what way?
01:10  evilaim: well, as I'm reading, they generally just overlap back wards
01:10  oksushi: huh?
01:10  evilaim: with width=3pm; left: -2px;
01:10  oksushi: evilaim: css provides 'border-radius'
01:10  p3lim: boogyman: didnt do anything
01:11  evilaim: *looks*
01:11  p3lim: stuff is so much easier with Lua
01:11  plantsVSme: or you could use bttom/top left/right parameters 
01:11  plantsVSme: and tons of spans
01:11  oksushi: p3lim: I hope you’re using Textadept :)
01:11  p3lim: oksushi: whats that?
01:12  boogyman: google knows :P
01:12  oksushi: p3lim: a real Lua fan would know :P
01:12  oksushi: http://code.google.com/p/textadept/
01:12  p3lim: and what makes that better than my current editor?
01:12  oksushi: the general Lua-ness
01:13  p3lim: using Vim, should cover every feature textadept has
01:13  Aleoss: Lua... reminds me of Monkey  Island.
01:13  oksushi: ok, you’re kinda missing the point, but cool, use whatever you’re comforatble with
01:14  p3lim: Lua, as in the programming language: http://lua.org
01:14  Aleoss: That game was programmed in Lua script and in Monkey Island 4 they made a tribute to it and also made the Lua Bar
01:15  p3lim: anyways, vertical-align: baseline; didnt work
01:15  stew-a: hey, i have a bunch of elements that are in a div and display horizontally. they're set to display:inline-block and that works fine, but there's a small gap between the elements which i can't seem to pinpoint the source of, how can i get rid of it? http://www.webdevout.net/test?01C
01:15  oksushi: stew-a: remove the white space between elements in the html
01:16  oksushi: inline-block takes white space into account (the nature of inline elements)
01:16  stew-a:  /facepalm, thanks
01:17  evilaim: Hey, thanks oksushi, you're my saviour for a day.
01:17  evilaim: This works brilliantly

01:20  rupert_88: how can css buttons be setup to use equal amounts of screen space?

01:20  boogyman: Visage: it's monday GMT too :-s so shake it at "daylight savings"
01:20  boogyman: rupert_88: same as any other element
01:20  oksushi: rupert_88: <button>s?
01:21  Visage: boogyman, I shall.

01:21  boogyman: cough *poo @ en-au :P cough
01:22  oksushi: hehe
01:22  p3lim: im stuck :/
01:22  oksushi: ♥
01:22  boogyman: you and your colour dialect!
01:23  boogyman: p3lim: update the testcase please?
01:23  p3lim: boogyman: http://p3lim.tumblr.com/post/1509205516
01:23  p3lim: thats the live page
01:26  rupert_88: oksushi: i notice you use several fonts there, is there a list somewhere of fonts which are safe to user (ie standard to nearly all machines on the web)?
01:26  oksushi: rupert_88: http://www.codestyle.org/css/font-family/sampler-CombinedResults.shtml
01:28  p3lim: Im considering making the buttons alone then positioning them manually :/
01:33  oksushi: `g better css font stacks @ rupert_88
01:34  rupert_88: oksushi: your solution doesnt work in ie6/7 is there anyway i can just use display:block instead to get desired solution
01:35  oksushi: rupert_88: you can float, and set a width. 
01:35  rupert_88: can width be 33.3%?
01:35  oksushi: that can be a percentage width
01:35  oksushi: but, remember that point values in percentages have a habit of adding up to more than 100%
01:35  oksushi: depending on the calculations of the browser
01:35  rupert_88: so if i can set a fix width 
01:36  oksushi: that's the safest bet
01:36  rupert_88: do you guys bother whether special handling for older browsers?
01:37  rupert_88: or do you just make sure it works on most current versions?
01:37  oksushi: it would be negligent not to test in older browsers
01:38  rupert_88: ive tried to design mine so itll work on >ie7
01:38  oksushi: what constitutes 'older' and 'obsolete' is up to you and the person who owns the site
01:38  rupert_88: and current firefox,chrome,mozilla as well
01:38  rupert_88: not mozilla i mean opera
01:38  rupert_88: lol
01:38  oksushi: you should include IE6, even if you use something like http://code.google.com/p/universal-ie6-css/
01:39  rupert_88: i guess i should include safari, suffice it to say my android phone correctly formats the website
01:40  plantsVSme: rupert_88 if you follow web standards when building ur websites you should be fine --- 99% 
01:40  rupert_88: i mean even on my galaxy s browsing the site is a pleasure on horizontal orientation
01:40  rupert_88: fits nearly perfectly
01:41  rupert_88: without zooming

01:44  mag1c: hello everyone
01:44  mag1c: quick question
01:44  mag1c: I am trying to align text inside blocks to the left
01:44  mag1c: and cant seem to make it work
01:44  mag1c: http://rasmusth.dk
01:44  mag1c: any ideas?
01:44  mag1c: it is the top menu

01:46  oksushi: mag1c: adjust the padding on .primary-menu ul li a, .primary-menu ul li .nolink
01:46  oksushi: you have 1em padding on the sides, putting the text into the middle. Maybe adjust just to padding-right
01:46  mag1c: hmm
01:47  rupert_88: wow you have lots of divs!
01:47  mag1c: rupert its a drupal thing
01:47  oksushi: mag1c: and seriously, if your cms is polluting your html with that much crud, it's time to consider a better cms
01:47  mag1c: :P
01:47  oksushi: no, it's /not/ acceptable
01:48  lostinspace_46: I am sure this is some stupid mistake that I should be seeing, but I don't.

01:48  rupert_88: im building my own, im a complete NOOB
01:48  rupert_88: its fun i must say,time consuming yes, but worth it when it begins to work the way you want
01:49  rupert_88: build in exactly the functionality you need etc
01:49  rupert_88: i guess there are a lot of people that use ready to go solutions and skin them though, fair enough if designing is what you do best
01:50  rupert_88: wow lol - didnt realise how bad the ipod touchs resolution is (3rd gen - 320x480)
01:50  evilaim: Is tables able to be used with border-radius?
01:51  lostinspace_46: BTW, this is my first try at a "from scratch" site, so be gentle :)
01:52  mag1c: oksushi: where do I have that padding?
01:52  oksushi: mag1c: I just gave you the selector?
01:52  oksushi: you should install Firebug or an equivalent

02:10  evilaim: that's in css
02:11  evilaim: I wanna know what the pull for it in php would be
02:11  evilaim: how does it pull rowa?
02:11  evilaim: I don't wanna have to rip the code apart to find out
02:11  evilaim: I'd rather just know what to look for:)
02:12  rupert_88: thats too specific for me and with no code or anything i cant really tell you
02:12  rupert_88: pull?
02:12  rupert_88: im quite new to this but have been using php myself
02:12  evilaim: like, it doesn't seem to be in my code:(
02:13  oksushi: evilaim: ask in ##php
02:13  evilaim: I'm pretty sure it works on if I make a new table
02:13  evilaim: the first tr will be effected

02:27  schone: At the moment it just wraps the the tabs underneath the tabs above it
02:28  lostinspace_46: rupert_88,  I may be misunderstanding you.  But now i have this.  http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisthatandus.5gigs.net%2F&profile=css21&usermedium=all&warning=1&lang=en  http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thisthatandus.5gigs.net%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&ss=1&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator%2F1.1
02:29  oksushi: schone: for that to work you need to set a width on the ul, or use display: table-cell (will not work in old IE)
02:29  schone: oksushi: so I can'
02:29  schone: eh , so I can't have a fluid width?
02:29  oksushi: lostinspace_46: you can't have an <img> there - it needs to be inside a block element
02:30  oksushi: schone: sure - with display: table-cell
02:30  schone: oksushi: so just adding that on the ul element?
02:30  lostinspace_46: oksushi,  Like a div, right?
02:30  oksushi: but if the image is for decoration - which it looks to be - then you should put it as the backgound of an existing meaningful element (like the h1)

04:10  Nautilus: i am having some trouble hiding a hover 'background' of some sort.  I thought maybe the fact that it was a <table> was causing it but now it's a <ul> and I get the same thing: http://www.indianvillagedetroit.org/photo-gallery/2009-iv-holiday-walk
04:13  stalecache: Nautilus, where's the problem?
04:14  Nautilus: hover over a vertical image
04:14  stalecache: i see
04:14  Nautilus: i want the red hover border but not the large white area
04:16  oksushi: Nautilus: div.view-gallery div.views-field-field-gallery-image-fid a:hover {background-color: #ffc;} is set
04:17  Nautilus: can I set that to 'none' or should I just match the green
04:17  oksushi: change to 'transparent'
04:17  Nautilus: ty
04:19  Nautilus: that does it, but now having irt as a <ul> introduced a probem, see how the 4th image does not show up under the 1st image due to the test description.  How can I make that happen?  eg: the second 'row' should move down to make room for the description
04:20  oksushi: Nautilus: make a fixed height for the li
04:20  Nautilus: but i don't know how high it might be (no caption, one line caption, two line caption, etc)
04:20  oksushi: then make them as high as they will ever be
04:20  Nautilus: sounds like it would look ugly 
04:21  oksushi: it already looks ugly, so nothing lost, nothing gained
04:21  oksushi: :)
04:21  Nautilus: :(
04:21  Nautilus: why is it ugly now? besides the fact they wanted light on dark
04:21  oksushi: Nautilus: you might like to do something like this (with or without the hover) http://oksushi.com/test/hover-image-captions.html
04:21  oksushi: in terms of label positioning
04:22  Nautilus: so no way to make it dynamically position depending on content?
04:23  oksushi: if you are asking 'how can I make it behave the way it did when it was using tables?' the answer is 'you don't'
04:24  Nautilus: ok, was just just making sure
04:26  stalecache: ok, i can't figure this out ... take a look at this: http://www.webdevout.net/test?03p&raw
04:27  stalecache: i'm trying to get "Something important" to be spaced away from the rest of the text if the rest of the text is on the same line as "Something important"
04:27  oksushi: stalecache: http://zoffix.com/new/left-right-same-line.html
04:27  stalecache: When you resize your window down so that "Something important" line breaks to a new line ... I don't want the left margin there
04:29  stalecache: I don't think that will work ... I want "Something important" to always be left aligned, just like the other text
04:30  stalecache: I just need the left margin on "Something important" to go away when there is no other text to the left of it (just container border).
04:37  Nautilus: stalecache: are you building the html with code (like php)?
04:38  stalecache: yeah, i think i got it working
04:38  Nautilus: maybe you could put a right border on the text, if there is no text don't output that span
04:39  stalecache: i only need it to work in webkit, this works pretty well: http://www.webdevout.net/test?03q&raw
04:39  stalecache: sorta though, the black text will line break early though
04:40  Nautilus: don't have any good ideas for ya
04:41  b1lly: stale, use php
04:43  stalecache: i think i got it close enough

13:02  ben_gareth1: Lazylegs: thanks for that, that's exactly what I thought but a friend put inline stylesheets in which I hate and I'm just trying to separate them, I learned to keep them separate from the pages that Rivvles was directing me to :-)

13:03  Viivi: And I'd like to see only "Some very long" on second column
13:04  Lazylegs: ben_gareth1, you can move the inline styling to css file.. if the element with inline style has id, just do a new selector in stylesheet
13:04  Lazylegs: ben_gareth1, if does not have id nor class.. add one to it and then add the stuff to stylesheet :)
13:04  riven: Viivi: table cells do not work like that in the default layout mode. They will expand to hold their content.

13:08  riven: Viivi: the only way you can get that to work is if you switch to the 'fixed' table layout mode, set `white-space: nowrap` on the cell, give it a set width, and limit the table's width as well.
13:08  Viivi: table's width has to be 100%

13:08  rivvles: philk__, Cross-browser inline-block: http://colinaarts.com/articles/inline-block-and-you/
13:09  Lazylegs: Thank you riven
13:09  Viivi: Riven: but I think I could use javascript to determine window's width and use fixed width anyway...
13:10  philk__: riven: thanks!
13:10  riven: Viivi: what's the purpose of what you're trying to achieve?
13:10  Lazylegs: Viivi, are you setting tabular data in to table?
13:10  yt_ror: How can I place a div on top of a google maps ?
13:11  riven: `css position @ yt_ror

13:15  philk__: how can i center a form element absolute on the screen?
13:15  riven: `deadcenter @ philk__
13:15  rivvles: philk__, http://reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/, http://www.zoffix.com/new/absolute-center-random-width-height.html
13:15  Viivi: if there is too long text in some columns, it should truncated, not wrapped (this will set column heights uneven); and also column widths should remain same
13:16  Lazylegs: ]faux-column @ viivi
13:16  Lazylegs: damn
13:16  Lazylegs: I dont know how to use bots :(
13:16  riven: what the hell does that have to do with faux columns?
13:18  Lazylegs: uneven column heights
13:19  Lazylegs: if tables are not used
13:19  riven: Why would tables not be used?
13:20  Lazylegs: You noticed the word "if"
13:20  compact: http://slikpanel.com/pet/ <--- any idea why right side claws aint on top of page too?
13:20  riven: Right, so you're implying there would be a reason not to used tables, hence my question, why?
13:20  riven: use*
13:21  riven: and *even if*, faux columns have nothing to do with this *at all*
13:21  Lazylegs: ooh, I missed a link.. :(

13:56  rivvles: yt_ror, Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
13:57  riven: ace_me: in the future :)

14:08  Reign1: what do you suggest to use in stead of px?
14:08  Reign1: em?
14:09  yt_ror: is there a way of floating element of ol partially ? as in have 3 text fields in one line and the text area and submit button next ?
14:10  riven: `font sizing @ Reign1
14:10  rivvles: Reign1, Consistent cross-browser font sizing: set the top-level (`html` or `body`) font-size to a magic number such as 76%, then use the `em` unit for font-size everywhere else.
14:11  riven: `css clear @ yt_ror
14:11  rivvles: yt_ror, CSS 'clear' property: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-clear
14:11  Reign1: why that "magic number" is 76%?
14:11  riven: Um, because it's a magic number
14:11  riven: By definition, there is no logical reason as to why they are what they are.
14:12  riven: ``wikipedia magic number
14:12  rivvles: Google says "Magic number (programming) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" • http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming) • more results at http://goo.gl/JXt10
14:12  Reign1: hehe, still, i believe theres a reason to why its 76%, tho ok, i dont mind it being magic
14:12  riven: well, not exactly what I was hoping for ;o
14:12  riven: Reign1: Coincidence.
14:13  riven: Browsers happen to render consistently at that value.
14:13  Reign1: interesting
14:14  riven: It's really just older IE that doesn't play nice at non-magic number values, IIRC, but whatever
14:16  Reign1: so as 1em = 16px and we set html/body to 76%, 1em is 12.16px?
14:17  riven: "1em = 16px", you can't guarantee that.
14:17  crazynellie: Having problems with how my site displays in IE, works in every browser but Internet Explorer.  I put my nextgen gallery in a hentryscroll box, it jumps out in IE as well as duplicates the scrollbox
14:17  riven: Never attempt to convert em to px or vice versa.
14:17  Reign1: got it
14:17  riven: Also, you shouldn't have to. If you do, your design spec fails.

18:43  ben_gareth1: would anyone be able to have a quick look at my website and tell me why my code isnt working?
18:46  CoJaBo: ben_gareth1:  what site
18:47  ben_gareth1: http://garethgroup.bravehost.com/asset/existingprojects/TBSN/index.html
18:47  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Uuh. Why is there another doctype, html, head, etc. after <body>?
18:48  JDigital: Are you putting a doctype on every file you include or somesuch
18:48  ZombieLoffe: Yeah, that's what it looks like
18:48  JDigital: I saw a portfolio of a guy who did that, claimed his rates were $200/hour, and also put "world's best fingerbanger"
18:49  ZombieLoffe: that sounds pretty dirty..
18:49  ben_gareth1: Zombieloffe: its a page within another page
18:49  ben_gareth1: the freehost adds advertising hence why
18:49  ZombieLoffe: Hugha... freehost...
18:49  ZombieLoffe: Gonna be hard to do any proper debugging when your output is that messed up...
18:49  ben_gareth1: yeah you know that thing for people with little money :-p
18:50  ZombieLoffe: Valid HTML and CSS should really be the foundation before even starting to fix any bugs..
18:50  ben_gareth1: that cant afford hosting because they cant afford the rent
18:50  ben_gareth1: sure = that's a luxury in this case
18:50  JDigital: If valid HTML is a luxury, then conforming CSS is also a luxury
18:51  ZombieLoffe: anyway, ben_gareth1, what particular problem are you talking about?
18:52  ben_gareth1: i need to move the top blue bar on the left over to the right and put an image beside it and move the vertical blue bar up below it
18:53  ZombieLoffe: Uh.. what? Got a mockup or something?
18:53  ZombieLoffe: Because that sort of confused me.
18:54  Phrogz: It's like one of those 1-15 sliding puzzles.
18:54  Phrogz: ...that ben_gareth1 doesn't know about because he can't afford it.
18:57  CoJaBo: ben_gareth1: There are free hosts that dont screw up your code- you might have better luck with one of those..
18:59  ben_gareth1: i searched for a very long time
19:01  CoJaBo: Byethost is one- PHP and MySQL even. Reliability is on a firm "you get what you pay for" basis, and they limit to one signup per IP (meaning you may not be able to sign up at all on a dynamic IP), but they dont mess up your code or insert ads (ads only in the admin areas). There is one other, but I dont know the link right now..
19:02  CoJaBo: ben_gareth1: If you are using a host that modifiys the page, you would have great deal of trouble getting CSS to work.
19:05  ben_gareth1: yeah but your beloved bythost doesn't allow you to sign up straight away
19:11  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1, http://byethost.com/free-hosting/news ?
19:12  m_e: is there a way to set the background-position property to have my background image always on the right side?
19:13  CoJaBo: ben_gareth1: The other was x10hosting.com - Signup is still a PITA, but less so than Byet and they dont restrict IPs like Byet does. However, you have to log in at least monthly or they suspend your account. They give you more than most free hosts.

19:49  ben_gareth1: move the top bar over to the left
19:49  ben_gareth1: put the logo beside it
19:49  ben_gareth1: and have the blue vertical bar underneath
19:49  ben_gareth1: the logo should push everything else down and to the left
19:49  ben_gareth1: so far i cant make the top bar move to the left
19:49  tw2113: the top bar with "An Example" in it?
19:49  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: If you want it "to the left", why does it have 100% width..?
19:50  ben_gareth1: so do i need to make the positioning of the horizontal and vertical bars relative to the image?
19:50  ben_gareth1: and yes the bar with an example in it needs to move left
19:50  ben_gareth1: to allow the logo in
19:50  tw2113: it's the full width of the browser already
19:50  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: you want the image _inside_ the blue bar?
19:50  ben_gareth1: no beside it :-)
19:50  ben_gareth1: thanks for your help btw
19:51  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1, float: left; on #topnavbar, remove width: 100%; and remove the <br> with clear: both. Then float: left; on #businesslogo
19:51  ben_gareth1: ok and will that move everything regardless of the logo size?
19:52  ben_gareth1: making the bars relative of the image
19:52  ZombieLoffe: Uh... no
19:52  ZombieLoffe: :P
19:52  ben_gareth1: if you know what i mean and im using the terms right
19:52  blez: how to change the default button ?
19:52  ZombieLoffe: I don't think I know what you mean.
19:52  ZombieLoffe: blez: Style it with CSS..?
19:52  blez: yes, how to style it
19:52  ben_gareth1: ok basically if i make the logo bigger i need the bars to move
19:52  ZombieLoffe: blez: using CSS properties... :P
19:52  ben_gareth1: both the vertical and horizontal one
19:53  ben_gareth1: the vertical needs to move down
19:53  ben_gareth1: but stay left
19:53  ben_gareth1: the horizontal needs to move right but still stay at the top
19:53  ZombieLoffe: Well yes, ben_gareth1, that would happen with the setup I described...

20:06  ben_gareth1: ah so it is the html and not the css
20:06  webresourc: The problem is that in IE when the sub menu opens the Hover is not working
20:06  ZombieLoffe: Yeah... you asked "Is that in the html file" and I was like "yes" :F
20:06  ben_gareth1: sorry my basd
20:06  ben_gareth1: bad*
20:07  webresourc: the effect that I use is to change the background and foreground color on the hover action
20:07  webresourc: all the browsers are working fine with that
20:07  webresourc: but except the Internet Explorer
20:08  ben_gareth1: so what was that <br style="clear: both;" /> for
20:08  ben_gareth1: ive not seen that before
20:08  mezod: i have defined a 200px wide div and i have 4 icons of 47px wide in it, for all resolutions seems to work good except for some computers (not all!) where with 1024px the 4 images show the last one in a new line. Any clues of what might be causing that?
20:09  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Clearing floats. basically saying "Floated elements can't extend past this point".

20:09  ben_gareth1: thanks
20:09  webresourc: any help please ?
20:09  ZombieLoffe: mezod: Some stray margin/padding?
20:09  ben_gareth1: i read a really good guide from a guy called something shannon
20:10  webresourc: is there any body who has read or reading my source code ?
20:10  webresourc: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/275840241
20:10  ben_gareth1: zombie: that's put the logo on the wrong side
20:12  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Them place <div id="businesslogo">...</div> before <div id="topnavbar">...</div> in the code
20:12  ZombieLoffe: In the HTML, even
20:15  webresourc: anybody please ?
20:15  mezod: ZombieLoffe i have been checking that but its not likely to be that i am only working with margins but should be working properly. The curious is that in some screens happens and in some others not. Shouldn't properties defined by px be interpreted = everywhere?
20:15  ben_gareth1: zombie: i've just done that but it isnt putting the image on the left
20:16  ben_gareth1: did you say put float left on both the topvnav bar and also the image
20:16  ben_gareth1: the css didnt save first time
20:16  ben_gareth1: so i had to redo it
20:16  ZombieLoffe: mezod: Yup, pretty much... got a link to the page?
20:16  ben_gareth1: rivvles ive read a similar tutorial so i understand them in principle
20:17  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1, both #topnavbar and #businesslogo
20:17  ben_gareth1: zombie that's what ive done
20:17  mezod: ZombieLoffe www.joanboixados.com it's in the div called "browser" where the 4 browser icons are shown
20:18  webresourc: anybody please ?
20:18  webresourc: no body who can help ?
20:18  webresourc: Here you can find the source code of my application http://bin.cakephp.org/view/275840241
20:19 --- will_Lynx is now known as will_hough
20:19  webresourc: I have a problem with the hover on Internet Explorer and I can't find the reason
20:19  ZombieLoffe: mezod: What could be messing things up is the white-space between each image (remember, images are inline elements) -- setting font-size: 0; on the containing <div> _might_ fix your issue...
20:19  freedgy: Hi all. I've notived for a while that fonts used on the web are far thicker than the same font / size used in photoshop. Even just with Georgia. I've tried things like font-weight: 100 ; but letters are always thicker.. like they look bold. any suggestions?
20:19  webresourc: the problem is that the hover not work on internet explorer when I display the sub menu
20:20  ZombieLoffe: Ugh, webresourc... 1) Specify version of IE. 2) Post a link to a live page, not code (and make sure it validates fully).
20:20  ZombieLoffe: `paste @ webresourc
20:20  rivvles: webresourc, Live pastebins: http://www.webdevout.net/test, http://www.jsfiddle.net/, http://pastehtml.com/
20:20  ZombieLoffe: Then someone _might_ be able to help... I probably won't, because I dislike drop-downs and I dislike debugging them in IE even more
20:20  Phrogz: freedgy: This is an issue with Photoshop rendering text itself instead of letting the OS do it. You have a similar issue with ClearType on Windows.
20:20  webresourc: rivvles here is my paste code http://bin.cakephp.org/view/275840241
20:21  ZombieLoffe: freedgy: Basically, photoshop is doing it wrong.
20:21  ZombieLoffe: webresourc: rivvles is a bot. DId you even read what I said?
20:21  webresourc: yes
20:21  webresourc: here is the live example
20:21  webresourc: http://www.fxf.gr/layout/new/
20:22  webresourc: and I get the error on Internet Explorer 8
20:22  mezod: ZombieLoffe just realized that if there's that space between the images is because i had to define the images with 47px instead of 50px to make it work in my resolution. So the problem is that i try to fit 4 images of 50px wide in a div of 200px and that wont work.
20:24  ben_gareth1: zombie i deleted the width in topvnavbar and added the float left to both that and the image, also deleted the float clearing thing from the html and swapped the two navs around but still not working
20:24  ionas: having two elements being display-inline block with a tab/linebreak/spaces inbetween results in "one" natural letter space as a gap - am I right?
20:24  ionas: are there workarounds around that?
20:24  webresourc: ZombieLoffe did you show live example ?
20:25  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Looks like you described it to me...
20:25  ZombieLoffe: webresourc: Yup, but I don't know why it's happening. Sorry
20:25  webresourc: thanks at all :)
20:26  webresourc: Somebody else who can help please ?
20:26  ben_gareth1: zombie: thanks, it seems to take the server a while to update for some reason
20:27  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Remember to ctrl+f5 so you're not viewing a cached version
20:28  ben_gareth1: zombie - thanks for that! so how can i get the top blue bar to go across the rest of the page and the one going down to go as far as the blue bar at the bottom?
20:28  ionas: e.g. giving the parent block element's font zero size, lineheight?
20:28  ionas: any iea?
20:28  ionas: idea
20:28  ben_gareth1: zombie: at the current height
20:28  ben_gareth1: and width
20:32  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: Remove float: left; from #topnavbar for the first issue
20:33  ZombieLoffe: ben_gareth1: As for the left column, there are several technqiue

20:34  webresourc: here is my web page http://www.fxf.gr/layout/new/
20:34  webresourc: the problem is that the hover action is not working on Internet Explorer for the sub menu
20:34  webresourc: all the other browsers are fine
20:35  ben_gareth1: is anyone good with internet explorer bugs in here?
20:37  webresourc: web_gareth1: I guess you are not ! :)

20:37  webresourc: about your help

20:37  webresourc: in any case
20:38  webresourc: I have to go
20:38  pensfan: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0Y&raw <- how do i stop this from running off the page?  FF only
20:38  webresourc: it's too late for me
20:38  freedgy: Hey ZombieLoffe and Phrogz, ok.. makes sense. Is there any way to force the font with css to be thinner? Love the slim look of fonts in photoshop :(
20:38  SaToNiO: if i have a png with some transparency and i want to show a background color when the image cannot be loaded how can i do it? if i use background-color, that color will be the background of the image
20:38  ben_gareth1: web resourc try posting on css forums
20:38  ben_gareth1: i dont know im new to css
20:39  webresourc: thanks a lot ben_gareth1 :) you are very kind :)
20:39  Phrogz: freedgy: The rasterization of fonts to the screen depends on the OS, OS settings, and in some cases the browser. You can maybe change the display on just your screen, if you want.
20:39  ben_gareth1: anyone: is there an easy way to extend my top nav bar to cover the extent of the window vertically?
20:41  freedgy: Phrogz... ehg. Ok.. thanks guys. So is Adobe using their own rendering of fonts for all their apps? The Georgia in ps and ai looks the same, slim and crisp.. but georgia in OpenOffice or Firefox is bloated and blurry.
20:41  SaToNiO: [pensfan] remove html, body { height: 100%; }
20:42  ben_gareth1: actually that first bit is ok now but i need to join the blue bar at the bottom with the vertical column if anyone would be able to help me get there by having a quick look?
20:43  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] link?
20:43  ben_gareth1: thanks Santonio: http://bgareth.byethost8.com/asset/existing_projects/TBSN/index.html
20:43  pensfan: SaToNiO, but i want it to fill out the visible area of the page
20:45  somasin: pensfan: margin:0 on body
20:47  pensfan: somasin, but i want it to go all the way down
20:47  pensfan: somasin, oh okay thank you .. sorry i was compounding it with ben_gareth1's advice
20:48  pensfan: that's perfect
20:48  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] did you changed the page?
20:49  ben_gareth1: ive done bits but according to my window its still not changed
20:50  ben_gareth1: ive deleted the purple bar
20:50  somasin: pensfan: if you run into problems when you fill that with content give http://www.alistapart.com/articles/conflictingabsolutepositions/ or checkout http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/examples/csslayout1.html
20:50  ben_gareth1: and tried to extend the blue bars
20:51  SaToNiO: you're mixing items with float: left with another that aren't all without a fixed width
20:51  ben_gareth1: Santonio ive just opened it in ie and i just have two rows, i cant refresh every time i need to in mozilla - i hate firefox
20:52  ben_gareth1: can you guide me through what i need to do here to get my blue left bar back again
20:53  ben_gareth1: ive just been told to put float left in by the other guy
20:53  ben_gareth1: ive been asking questions in here and everyone has contradicted each other since 11am this morning its now nearly 20:00
20:53  ben_gareth1: ive achieved nothing
20:54  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] can you show me what do you want in a paint or something image?
20:54  ben_gareth1: ive read forum after forum, webpage after webpage
20:54  SaToNiO: without knowing it's extremely difficult
20:54  ben_gareth1: well i can explain
20:54  ben_gareth1: i want a blue bar going across the top
20:54  ben_gareth1: a logo to the left of that bar
20:54  ben_gareth1: and a blue bar going down underneath the logo on the left
20:55  ben_gareth1: and a blue bar going across the bottom from the blue bar going down the left of the page
20:55  ben_gareth1: i want the width to resize dependant on the window size
20:55  somasin: and everything moves when you scroll?
20:56  monk13: hey all, just curious is it possible to do hovers in 'css' emails? i know emails are pretty old school still. tables etc. I had a simple javascript onmouseover, but i realized that problem stripped out. just wanted to confirm css and js hover image buttons arent really possible in emails.
20:56  SaToNiO: i would do a div for the logo and the top thing
20:57  SaToNiO: with background color:blue
20:57  SaToNiO: with the image floating to the left, and remove height on #bussinesslogo
21:01  Phrogz: ben_gareth1: TIMTOWTDI is not the same as "everyone contracting each other". (Yes, I know you're a beginner who doesn't know what that acronym means; Google it.)
21:04  figaroo: How think are scrollbars?
21:05  ionas: depends - 10-30px
21:05  ionas: usually
21:05  figaroo: I guess that question is relative to which OS in particular. But how think are they on most OSes?
21:05  ionas: thick
21:06  figaroo: Oh I see
21:06  ionas: find screenshots from the os on google images
21:06  figaroo: Well heres the deal
21:06  ionas: and "measure" it ;p
21:06  figaroo: I have a container with a "grid" of images
21:06  Phrogz: I'm going to guess 16px
21:06  figaroo: div.images
21:07  figaroo: I set the div.images container's overflow to scroll
21:07  Phrogz: figaroo: The Enter key is not punctuation. Aim for a minimum of one thought per comment, OK? :)
21:07  ben_gareth1: santonio: could you repeat the last thing you said to me, it disappears out of my window
21:07 * Phrogz goes off to do something productive.
21:07  ben_gareth1: ive just created an image
21:07  figaroo: Phrogz, you're right. So sorry. :\

21:11  figaroo: here's the shizzle: http://jsfiddle.net/g2eLc/
21:12  figaroo: read the notes in the JS pane
21:13  figaroo: Idk why there's a space on the right of the scrollbar like that, it isn't like that on my site, so ignore it.
21:17  somasin: figaroo: .images{text-align:center} is this what you want?
21:17  figaroo: somasin, no, I don't think so.
21:18  figaroo: What I want is for the scrollbar to be added to the width rather than take up 10-30px of the width.
21:18  ben_gareth1: hey is anyone still around?
21:19  figaroo: I have each image container (span.image) specifically set with width, height and margin.
21:19  ben_gareth1: i need to get the left bar back
21:19  ben_gareth1: its gone missing :-p
21:20  figaroo: I also added some padding on div.images to make everything look right. But the scrollbar takes up some width which makes the fourth image wrap to the next row.
21:21  figaroo: I could add padding-right to the div.images container, but sense scrollbar widths vary from OS to OS, I wouldn't know what value to give padding-right.
21:22  ben_gareth1: could someone have a look at my site and the image ive created to tell me where ive gone wrong please?
21:24  ben_gareth1: ive been at this since 11am and im just not getting anywhere
21:24  ben_gareth1: please help :-)
21:26  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] so you want something like that: http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/6120/assettbsn1289247851735.png

21:29  SaToNiO: first of all, remove the height: 50px from bussineslogo
21:29  ben_gareth1: ok :-)
21:29  ben_gareth1: santonio: will that allow the bars to resize to accomodate the logo
21:30  figaroo: This is what I wanted to do: http://jsfiddle.net/g2eLc/1/ But my solution requires an extra div element. Is there a better way?
21:30  speckle: can someone help me with a small css problem
21:30  speckle: My input field is overlapping the amount given and is pushing it to the next line
21:30  speckle: can someone help me extend that area?
21:31  figaroo: speckle, can we see the code?
21:31  speckle: One second
21:31  somasin: figaroo: are your images consistant width?
21:31  SaToNiO: in whta way will it help to have a weight that isn't the correct?
21:31  speckle: http://pastebin.com/cLhizRjL
21:31  speckle: The css
21:31  speckle: let me get the form now
21:31  ben_gareth1: santonio: who are you talking to?
21:31  SaToNiO: you ben_gareth1

21:32  ben_gareth1: oh i dont understand/
21:32  speckle: If you want a url of my webhost to see whats wrong I can also provide that
21:32  speckle: So you can see a demo of whats wrong
21:32  SaToNiO: another thing
21:33  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] put a #footer p { margin: 0 }
21:33 --- riven` is now known as riven_
21:33  figaroo: speckle, that would be better. :)
21:33  speckle: http://login.rsgrandmarket.co.cc/register.php
21:33  speckle: Sorry about the co.cc lo
21:33  speckle: lol*
21:34  ben_gareth1: santonio: is that inside a div, does the number need a ';' after it?
21:35  ben_gareth1: are there any spaces there within the curly braces?
21:35  SaToNiO: i think it's not mandatory if it's only one property
21:35  SaToNiO: also
21:35  SaToNiO: h1 margin should be 0
21:35  figaroo: speckle, looks like the HTML is messed up. The third div.field is inside of the second div.field. :S
21:36  SaToNiO: #topnavbar h1 { margin: 0; }
21:37  SaToNiO: after that two changes both things will be together
21:37  figaroo: speckle, make sure you have a </div> closing tag for the second div.field
21:37  speckle: good catch
21:37  speckle: let me try that
21:37  speckle: Nothing changed
21:37  somasin: figaroo: I don't see what your added div changed. The change in your width rules made your unwanted space go away
21:38  ben_gareth1: santonio: i dont have a h1 margin
21:38  speckle: Its something with the css I think
21:38  speckle: Myabe like extend the areas but I am un aware how
21:38  speckle: Maybe*
21:39  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] it's auto, and you have to put it to 0 if you don't want it
21:39  SaToNiO: the same as p margin
21:39  ben_gareth1: was the p margin outside of the footer?
21:39  SaToNiO: yes
21:39  figaroo: somasin, it wasn't the space that was the issue. Like I said in the JS pane on jsfiddle (where it says NOTES), the unwanted space doesn't appear on my site. Only on jsfiddle does the space appear, so don't focus on that space 'cause that's not the issue.
21:39  ben_gareth1: i have a # footer and a #footer p
21:40  speckle: figaroo: any idea whats wrong?
21:40  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] but the h1 margin is destroying it
21:40  figaroo: speckle, I went into my web inspector and moved around the HTML and it works fine now. Make sure you HTML is okay. ;)
21:40  SaToNiO: put its margin to 0 and you'll have them together
21:40  SaToNiO: the footer and the bar
21:40  speckle: Can I see your adjustments?
21:40  SaToNiO: [speckle] i'm with figaroo, i think the problem is your html
21:41  speckle: Am I missing a tag you believe>
21:41  speckle: ?
21:41  SaToNiO: yes
21:41  figaroo: speckle, let me look it over again.
21:41  speckle: okay
21:42  SaToNiO: put a </div> before the <div class="field"> of the confirm password
21:42  figaroo: somasin, the problem I was having (before I added the extra div) was that I didn't know how to add the extra space for the scrollbar to the padding-right of the container because the scrollbar's width varies from platform to platform.
21:42  ben_gareth1: santonio so that was #topvnavbar h1 {margin:0}
21:43  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] have you uploaded it? i can't see it
21:43  figaroo: speckle, I think you are missing </span> closing tags for the the second, third, and fourth div.field elements
21:43  speckle: Yea, I found a few things
21:43  speckle: Let me do a few patches
21:43  figaroo: speckle, just have a look at the source of the outputted page.
21:44  SaToNiO: it's not a span it's a div what it's missing
21:44  figaroo: SaToNiO, I don't think so, look at the source, not the inspector HTML view, but the View Source.
21:44  SaToNiO: ok
21:45  figaroo: Actually, it's both span and div.
21:45  speckle: cool
21:45  speckle: I fixed it
21:45  figaroo: You're missing </span></div>
21:45  speckle: Thanks for pointing them out
21:45  speckle: Yup I got it
21:45  speckle: thanks guys
21:45  figaroo: np
21:45  figaroo: What browser do you use?
21:45  speckle: Firefox 4.5 beta
21:45  figaroo: okay, so you do have firebug then. ;)
21:45  speckle: I need to install it
21:45  speckle: lol
21:46  SaToNiO: 					<div class=""><span class="input"><input name="password" id="password" class="text" type="password" value="" />
21:46  SaToNiO: 				</div> <!-- .field -->
21:46  speckle: It deleted in the new beta upgrade
21:46  SaToNiO: missing </div> and </span> there
21:46  figaroo: speckle, a debugger like firebug or inspector is a must IMHO.
21:46  speckle: Yup
21:46  speckle: lol
21:46  figaroo: SaToNiO, he got it. :D
21:46 --- opsec is now known as zodiac
21:46  SaToNiO: great

21:47  speckle: Do you like the firefox
21:47 --- zodiac is now known as opsec
21:47  speckle: developer console though?
21:47  speckle: I like the one in google chrome better
21:47  SaToNiO: [figaroo] what's the problem?
21:48  figaroo: speckle, I like Google Chrome as a browser, so I'm pretty much stuck with whatever the web inspector has; you can't pry me away from chrome. :P
21:48  ben_gareth1: Santonio: could you have a look at the css to see if ive done it right, it is impossible to get it right with the speed of this window and not being able to copy and paste from it
21:48  speckle: Indeed
21:48  speckle: Its very easy and clean to view
21:48  speckle: Which is why I like it
21:48  figaroo: Satonio, well, noticed how there are two div containers for the images -- a div within div.images?
21:49  SaToNiO: ok noticed
21:49  speckle: Too bad firebug isnt avaliable for firefox 4.6 et.
21:49  speckle: yet
21:49  ben_gareth1: Santonio: this hasn't worked, would you be able to have a look at the css to see if its correct?
21:50  figaroo: The reason why I have this is because I want to set a specific width for the whole image area, but I don't want the scrollbars to interfere with that width.
21:50  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] it worked i see it together
21:50  ben_gareth1: with three blue bars?
21:50  SaToNiO: both with firefox and internet explorer
21:50  SaToNiO: waht three blue bars?
21:50  ben_gareth1: have you not looked at the original image
21:51  SaToNiO: there wasn't a left part because you removed it
21:51  SaToNiO: put it again
21:51  ben_gareth1: i got rid of a purple bit
21:51  ben_gareth1: none of the three blue bars
21:51  ben_gareth1: and i sent you an image to show you what i needed to do
21:51  ben_gareth1: ive spent 10 hours getting to that stage man
21:51  ben_gareth1: and its all gone?
21:52  SaToNiO: [ben_gareth1] you removed it
21:52  fiveofoh1: Hey, so quick preference question: I have a container class that is wide on some pages, narrow on the others
21:52  SaToNiO: i didn't tell you to do that
21:52  figaroo: So what I did was add an extra div and set the width and margin properties on that. This way the div.images container's width is fluid, so the scrollbar's thickness (width) will not effect the wrapping of the span.images.
21:52  ben_gareth1: i removed a purple bar
21:52  ben_gareth1: not a blue one
21:52  SaToNiO: you removed both
21:52  ben_gareth1: no i didnt
21:52  fiveofoh1: Do I do two classes, container_wide and container_narrow, or have a single container class, with an included CSS that overrides it one way or the other?
21:52  ben_gareth1: and youve seen an image to back up the three bar frame
21:52  figaroo: Satonio, so is there a way to achieve this same effect without the extra inner div?
21:53  SaToNiO: i'm going to read your problem now, wait a moment
21:53  ben_gareth1: Santonio who you speaking to/
21:54  speckle: figaroo: another problem
21:54  speckle: lol
21:54  figaroo: speckle, link?
