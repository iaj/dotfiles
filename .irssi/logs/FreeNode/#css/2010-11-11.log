00:16  oksushi: kenthree: by default, elements are 'position: static'. These elements are not effected by z-index

01:26  MuKatroNi: is there a tool to remove unussed code?
01:27  oksushi: MuKatroNi: check out 'dust me selectors'
02:07  echoprinter: If I have something like this: <div class="center"><h1>Some Text</h1></div> How can I center that text in my CSS file? Right now it stays left aligned.
02:08  ZombieLoffe: Echoes2. .center h1 { text-align: center; }
02:08  ZombieLoffe: text-align: center; centers text and inline elements inside the element you apply it to
02:09  echoprinter: ZombieLoffe: Thank you.

02:31  milleja46: how would i in css tell the background image that i've also set in css to fill that area it's in?
02:45  oksushi: milleja46: you want to scale the background image?
02:45  oksushi: `css background-size
02:45  rivvles: CSS background-size: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-size
02:46  milleja46: oksushi: yes, but i want to make it bigger, i might just end up making another one though i don't think it's gonna go with my color scheme i'm making soon
02:47  oksushi: milleja46: use backgrouns-size like I just gave you (support is limited)
02:48  John_Boehner: Can I make a gradient stop a pixel value.
02:48  John_Boehner: Rather than a percentage?
02:54  John_Boehner: I'm a little confused.
02:54  John_Boehner: Is there gradient support in CSS3 that *may* be adopted someday by IE9?
02:55  John_Boehner: Or is it strictly a quirk of FF and Webkit?
03:00  oksushi: John_Boehner: http://caniuse.com/ will give you information about which browsers support what
03:01  milleja46: ok i'm confused i've also been editing colors and i just put #ffffff for my white or what it should be and it's not saving over to it....
03:02  oksushi: now everyone’s confused. Did you have a question?
03:02  milleja46: yes, how do you set the color in css?
03:02  oksushi: color for text?
03:02  milleja46: i thought it was background:(color code here)
03:02  milleja46: no for the area
03:03  oksushi: sure - background, or background-color
03:03  milleja46: well i tried that but it's still this green color i orginally had it set too
03:05  milleja46: umm, nevermind....
03:05  oksushi: `url
03:05  rivvles: Always provide a link to a *live* page or pared-down testcase so we can see the problem in action. Looking at code alone usually isn't very effective. Also see `paste and `testcase.
03:05  milleja46: i had my actual site, and the test part of it open at the same time, so the live part wasn't refreshing, and i thought i was refreshing the test version
03:07  milleja46: now i feel stupid

03:31  milleja46: wow i just noticed something about that picture oksushi it's width is 1983 which is a important classic rock date if i remember and 1402, is some history thing
03:32  aurilliance: hahaha
03:32  milleja46: weird how i spotted that
03:32  interopcop: how do you make a div that floats right but doesn't stick to the right side of the bounding box?  do you have to do negative margins?
03:32  oksushi: huh?
03:32  interopcop: (on the rightmost box)
03:32  milleja46: oksushi: i agree...huh?
03:33  interopcop: sorry
03:33  interopcop: I create a div for 2 columns in a form
03:33  interopcop: inside that div I create a div for the left column, width 20%
03:33  interopcop: beside that I have a div for the right column, width 20%
03:33  milleja46: a whole lot easier if you use pixels instead
03:34  oksushi: sounds like a lot of divs
03:34  milleja46: yea i know
03:34  milleja46: you should see my site's css now
03:34  interopcop: ok teach me then because for some reason this stuff is like particle physics
03:34  oksushi: interopcop: do you have a diagram of the effect you are trying to achieve?
03:34  aurilliance: milleja46, link me?
03:34  milleja46: http://milleja46games.frih.org/ oksushi that's my site right now

03:35  milleja46: i've still got some work to do on header and color scheme

03:35  oksushi: `know xhtml @ milleja46
03:35  rivvles: milleja46, Are you using XHTML? Read this: http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml, http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml, http://www.webdevout.net/articles/validity-and-well-formedness.
03:35  milleja46: wait how is what i've got wrong so far?
03:36  milleja46: with the doctype and all
03:36  oksushi: milleja46: you have an xhtml doctype
03:36  milleja46: yea and?
03:36  oksushi: if you were interested, I gave you links to read that might make you reconsider
03:36  Mkop: I need help with a CSS issue. for some reason, my submit button is jumping around when I show or hide another div on the page. http://mkopinsky.aishdas.org/elections/admin.php, click election status, then click on and away from "Use scheduler"
03:37  milleja46: i know but the code i used according to the site that helped me alittle bit said that a doctype was nesscary
03:37  milleja46: so that code would work right in some browsers
03:37  oksushi: it /is/ - but not an xhtml one. Read :)
03:37  milleja46: oy.....
03:37  milleja46: dang you oksushi
03:37  aurilliance: oksushi, milleja46 thanks for the help, I'm outta here
03:38  milleja46: bye
03:38  oksushi: Mkop: looks like a javascript issue
03:38  interopcop: oksushi: http://i55.tinypic.com/29ej1x3.png
03:39  Mkop: oksushi: as far as I can tell, the javascript is only affecting the styling of that div. that in turn is causing the button to move
03:39  oksushi: interopcop: what is the url to that page?
03:39  milleja46: so wait what doctype should i be using so that this works right?
03:39  oksushi: Mkop: sure - so adjust the javascript that is adjusting the css
03:39  oksushi: milleja46: the link above just told you
03:39  interopcop: for some reason, implemented on is stuck to the right side fo the boudnding box, even though the left column it's floating beside is only 180px wide
03:40  interopcop: oksushi: it's an intranet site - not publicly addressable
03:40  milleja46: i know but i'm talking about if it should be strict transitional, or otherwise
03:40  oksushi: milleja46: read, and it will answer your question
03:40  Mkop: oksushi: the JS is just:
03:40  Mkop: 	$("#radio1,#radio2,#radio3").click(function() {
03:40  milleja46: i thought it was strict....
03:40  Mkop: 		$("#status_scheduler").hide('fast');
03:40  Mkop: 	});
03:40  Mkop: and .show()
03:40  Mkop: it's only hiding and showing, that's it
03:41  milleja46: ok i'm giving this a rest, it's bed time
03:41  oksushi: Mkop: sure - then ask why that would effect the other thing? Surely, it is then positioning itself in the way?
03:42  Mkop: the way I could get the div to show up to the right was with #status_scheduler{
03:42  Mkop: 	float:left;
03:42  Mkop: 	position:relative;
03:42  Mkop: 	left:300px;
03:42  Mkop: 	top:-160px;
03:42  Mkop: }

03:43  interopcop: oksushi, here's the css and html: https://gist.github.com/671895
03:44  interopcop: maybe I just need to put the left col on the page first, then the right col
03:44  subhash: Am trying get breadcrumbs in a line but its not coming as intended ... its outout is different in chrome and firefox  ... <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

03:44  subhash:  
03:44  subhash:     <head>
03:45  oksushi: Mkop: ok, your issue is the use of positioning on #status_scheduler
03:45  oksushi: you are giving it a large negative top
03:45  Mkop: yes
03:45  Mkop: what I ideally wanted to do was make it inline with the previous div
03:45  oksushi: and left
03:45  Mkop: but it wouldn't go inline, for who knows why
03:46  Mkop: so I used this hack, which, as hacks tend to do, has weird consequences
03:46  oksushi: Mkop: you need to read http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/36-css-static-and-relative-positioning/#relative
03:46  subhash: am sorry the last msg ... its really my falt
03:46  oksushi: Mkop: "The thing to remember about relative positioning is that it’s only the generated box that is shifted. The element still remains where it was in the static document flow. That’s where it “takes up space” as far as other elements are concerned. This means that the shifted box may end up overlapping other elements’ boxes, because they still act like the relatively positioned element has remained where it should be
03:46  oksushi: , before the positioning was applied. "
03:48  Mkop: if I float left a div, it will only float within its parent div, right?

03:49  oksushi: subhash: breadcrumb navigation is not a paragraph
03:51  subhash: But if i remove the paragraph ... the links are coming to left  vertically one by one ... in all browsers
03:52  oksushi: subhash: what html element would be more appropriate for a breadcrumb, do you think?
03:53  subhash: oksushi : i think list items
03:54  mechler: Ordered list
03:54  oksushi: cool - I agree
03:54  mechler: Mkop: Yes.
03:55  Mkop: unfortunately, though, the parent div doesn't maintain its full height
03:55  Mkop: that may be related to the jquery UI though
03:58  mechler: Mkop: Try adding "overflow: hidden;" to your parent div.
03:58  Mkop: whoo hoo!
03:58  Mkop: mechler to the rescue
03:59  mechler: Mkop: That's the clearfix issue. Google it. Remember it.
03:59  mechler: Mkop: There are a few ways to fix it. I'm not honestly sure which is best. Someone here knows better than I do, I'm sure.
03:59  oksushi: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
04:00  mechler: ^
04:01  mechler: I didn't realize that you had to trigger hasLayout for IE 6 and 7. That's kind of interesting.
04:06  Mkop: this is one of those times that I have the luxury of saying, "_I_ wrote the app, _I_ get to tell you not to use IE6"
04:06  Mkop: so overflow:hidden it is, and none of this business about hasLayout
04:08  Mkop: I spend all day at work making things work the way the client wants it. now I'm on my own time, and I don't have to deal with bad software imposing bad constraints if I don't want to
04:08  Mkop: (do I sound bitter? nawwww)
04:09  Mkop: as an aside, do you guys have any comments on my basic UI? this is my first foray into front-end development, and have been learning a ton, but want input on how to make a better product
04:09  oojacoboo: Mkop: we don't support IE6 on our application either
04:09  oojacoboo: it's pretty common these days
04:10  Mkop: you know what's the worst? some tasks at work can only be done in IE6. Believe it or not, we use tooling that *requires* IE6
04:10  oojacoboo: haha
04:11  oojacoboo: well, we're a SaaS company, so...

04:13  Mkop: some of the IBM tooling is super super crappy
04:13  oojacoboo: magento FTW
04:13  oksushi: ew
04:14  Mkop: I have a friend who does magento development
04:14  Mkop: I don't see how PHP is really scalable to that extent
04:14  Mkop: I guess that's because I haven't done large-scale PHP development yet
04:14  oojacoboo: Mkop: do you use facebook?!?
04:14  oojacoboo: 'nuff said
04:14  Mkop: true
04:14  Mkop: although they did stuff to make it scale
04:14  oojacoboo: everyone does
04:14  Mkop: they have some open source stuff
04:15  Mkop: PHP compiler
04:15  oojacoboo: yea, well, it doesn't just do it all for you...
04:16  Mkop: btw, I discovered tonight that jquery tabs are MUCH better than jquery dialogs (where possible). With tabs, they remain part of the flow, so <input>s remain part of the <form>. With dialogs, they are separate, so any data typed there needs to be copied to a hidden
04:28  Mkop: how can I get the status_scheduler inputs to align right? http://mkopinsky.aishdas.org/elections/admin.php
04:28  Mkop: I had done it before with position:absolute but I think that's an ugly hack
04:30  Mkop: oh, I know what to do
04:36  cosmint: What's a good modern way to make a horizontal bar of image+text links, each image with text underneath, each image+text a single tab target, skeleton code: <a><img>text</a>
04:36  cosmint: Do I still put a <br> in there after <img>?
04:38  oksushi: no - use css
04:39  cosmint: <br> after <img>, float each span left, padding etc, br clear after all
04:39  oksushi: img {display: block;} would do it
04:39  oksushi: and never use 'br clear all'
04:39  cosmint: That makes a vertical bar.
04:39  cosmint: effectively the same as: img<br>text<br>...
04:39  oksushi: here is an example http://oksushi.com/test/hover-image-captions.html
04:40  oksushi: of course, you may not want hover
04:40  oksushi: and you can position the text differently, but it's a good exampl eof the markup required
04:41  kn0wn: hi, i'd like to make an image seem "brighter" by putting a semi-transparent PNG over it
04:41  kn0wn: how would i go by doing this?
04:41  oksushi: o_O
04:41  macabre_: 0_o
04:41  oksushi: what colour?
04:41  cosmint: O,o
04:42  oksushi: kn0wn: img {background: #fff; opacity: 0.9;}
04:42  cosmint: Why do you define ul {} twice?
04:42  oksushi: to give ie hasLayout
04:43  oksushi: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/ @ cosmint
04:43  kn0wn: oksushi: opacity seems to effect the entire image
04:43  oksushi: kn0wn: of course
04:43  kn0wn: <kn0wn> hi, i'd like to make an image seem "brighter" by putting a semi-transparent PNG over it
04:43  oksushi: you don't want all of the image? you didn't specify
04:43  kn0wn: pardon?
04:44  cosmint: So..
04:44  cosmint: What if I just use a table?
04:44  kn0wn: i want to make an image just seem brighter
04:44  oksushi: cosmint: then you would fail
04:44  cosmint: 5 years ago I did css. And people had the same answers.
04:44  kn0wn: from what i read the best way to do this is by putting a semi-transparent PNG over it
04:44  cosmint: So I made my site without tables.
04:44  kn0wn: so, any suggestions?
04:44  cosmint: But now 5 years later I still have to hack around to get simple layouts.
04:45  oksushi: hack around?
04:45  cosmint: So, if tables work and are simple... and in 5 years since I designed a table-free I still can't do basic layout with a bunch of tricks...
04:45  oksushi: then you are Doing It Wrong
04:46  cosmint: s/with/without
04:46  oksushi: cosmint: i you feel so strongly, go and hack a layout with tables
04:46  oksushi: but take it elsewhere, this is #css
04:47  oksushi: kn0wn: you cant make an image 'brighter' with css. You can use some trick like I gave you to fake it to an extent
04:47  cosmint: I hated tables over 10 years ago... but sometimes I wonder why I have to read blog after blog for every simple layout.
04:47  oksushi: kn0wn: here is an example http://www.webdevout.net/test?01q&raw
04:47  kn0wn: <kn0wn> from what i read the best way to do this is by putting a semi-transparent PNG over it
04:47  oksushi: kn0wn: …
04:48  oksushi: I read what you wrote
04:48  oksushi: and I am responding to you, don't be rude
04:48  kn0wn: that seems to be the trick, from what i read
04:48  oksushi: you can also use javascript, something like http://mezzoblue.github.com/PaintbrushJS/demo/usage.html
04:49  oksushi: or, use some server-side processing, like phpThumb
04:49  oksushi: which can use ImageMagick or GD to process images
04:50  cosmint: display:inline-block in the container works, don't need display:block on contained elements
04:50  cosmint: Of course, that's just mozilla. I think I will link to chromeframe for ie. :p
04:50  oksushi: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/ cosmint, you should read and bookmark this
04:50  cosmint: I got it.
04:51  cosmint: Thank you.
05:00  Mkop: from a UI perspective, what are your thoughts about showing something as disabled by setting the div's opacity to .4 and setting the inputs to disabled=true?
05:01  Phrogz_: 0.4 seems a bit low, but sure.
05:03  Mkop: now the challenge is getting jquery to do that. shouldn't be too bad though
05:06  Phrogz_: .css({opacity:0.4}) done
05:09  Mkop: and .attr('disabled',true)
05:10  Mkop: * phunster has quit (Quit: What if the Hoki Poki really is what it's all about?) <-- heretic! it's spelled Hokey Pokey!
05:17  Mkop: I LOVE the opacity/disabled look

05:36  blindingdawn: looks fine on my 1920 x 1080
05:37  cosmint: surely there's a more modern way to do column layouts
05:38  cosmint: header, footer, left sidebar fixed, right content fluid, without old float/clear tricks, excessive containers, placing sidebar after content in html
05:38  blindingdawn: I'm open to suggestions
05:38  blindingdawn: as long as it comes out looking right
05:38  cosmint: eg: not like this: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/layouts/item/css-liquid-layout-21-fixed-fluid/
05:39  cosmint: blindingdawn, sorry, im talking about my own problem

05:51  blindingdawn: Can someone help me out with a layout issue?
05:51  oksushi: blindingdawn: so far you said 'its coming out wrong'
05:51  antipop: oksushi well, what I want is cenetring the textx inside the imput box, these linsk doe s nto help too much
05:51  oksushi: was there a specific css issue?
05:51  oksushi: antipop: did you adjust the line-height
05:52  antipop: no, let me see
05:52  blindingdawn: Sorry. The Nivo slider should be to the right of the Google Ad and flush with the rest of the site. For some reason it's expanding the length of the DIV and screwing up the layout
05:53  antipop: oksushi I looked at http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_line-height.asp and i can't see how line.height is related
05:53  cosmint: every 2 column, 1 fixed, 1 fluid, layout i look at is junk
05:53  oksushi: antipop: why don't you just give it a go?
05:54  oksushi: cosmint: http://oksushi.com/test/2col/
05:54  antipop: ok
05:54  blindingdawn: The slider should resize to the size of all of the pics that it pulls and fit right into the space (682 x 250)
05:54  oksushi: blindingdawn: #top_container object {float; left;}
05:55  cosmint: that's amazing oksushi
05:56  antipop: oksushi trying several values, and I can't find anything ussable
05:57  antipop: here is my test http://redsun2.freehostia.com/
05:59  antipop: any help?
06:00  oksushi: antipop: dude
06:00  oksushi: experiment yourself. Try giving it a line-height the same as the height
06:02  antipop: oksushi I tried, but regarless the value I set in firefox, the text does not move
06:04  blindingdawn:  oksushi: what do you mean?
06:04  oksushi: blindingdawn: umm, what? I just gave you some css
06:05  blindingdawn: oksushi: that does what?
06:05  oksushi: `tias
06:05  rivvles: TIAS: Try It And See.
06:06  oksushi: unless i misunderstood what you were asking for

07:33  shouvik: help*
07:34  shouvik: I am facing an issue when I resize my canvas, my mouse clicking on the canvas becomes very off
07:34  shouvik: in the sense, when I render my canvas in one ration of the browser
07:36  shouvik: the clicks work
07:37  shouvik: then with the same rendering if I resize my broswer
07:37  shouvik: the canvas moves in respect to the left and right margin and I lost control of my canvas screen
07:37  shouvik: but on getting it back to the same alignment
07:37  shouvik: it works again

09:03  somasin: Squarism: actually simply placing alot of span tags on 1 line in your file with no spaces between them stops wrapping
09:04  somasin: no spaces between them and no spaces inside of them (exactly)

09:05  schwarzes: somasin : what if i want to increase the height of that bar which class should i add height to
09:05  somasin: Squarism: this may or may not help http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/10/html-css-trick-for-displaying-code.html
09:06  Wutklumpen: wasn't there something like &shy; for a "if-necessary-break"?
09:07  somasin: schwarzes: if you set display:block on <span id="TICKER_BODY"> then add padding to <span id="TICKER_BODY"> to increase the height
09:07  somasin: schwarzes: otherwise add padding to the containing block of <span id="TICKER_BODY"> (it's parent <td> tag)
09:07  Squarism: somasin, thanx man
