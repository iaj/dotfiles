16:38  iaj: lo there
16:38 --- Channel #css was synced in 4 seconds
16:39  NET||abuse: when did FF start support for text-shadow?
16:39  iaj: how could I http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=3 have the div#inhalt take the whole available space that is left in #content?? width: 100% doesn't let the right part on the same level
16:39  NET||abuse: and are they ever going to ditch the -moz prefix for border-radius?
16:39  NET||abuse: chrome has ditched it, just border-radius without any -webkit prefix works
16:40  tw2113: dunno exactly when, but try beta8 and see :P
16:40  NET||abuse: :) hehe
16:40  NET||abuse: was just looking at http://india60.com/ and noticed the use of text-shadow there
16:41  NET||abuse: and it's just the same in FF
16:41  NET||abuse: but what about IE?
16:41  NET||abuse: just booted a vista vm to find out.
16:41  iaj: is there any way to make a div with float:left use all the available space that's left :/ ?
16:41  tw2113: well IE9 is the only version of IE that will offer any decent support for CSS3 stuff
16:42  NET||abuse: iaj, only way i can think of is you set the margin-right on the div,
16:42  NET||abuse: then it will use the full width minus your right margin
16:42  NET||abuse: then have something floated right that's width is less than that right-margin
16:43  iaj: NET||abuse: hmmm so I combine width: 100% margin-right = right div's size
16:43  NET||abuse: no need to set width:100$
16:43  NET||abuse: %
16:43  Maurice: is there an admin here?
16:46  iaj: NET||abuse: i tried now..http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=3
16:46  iaj: but it still isn't working
16:46  NET||abuse: one sec
16:47  blackice2999|afk: some CSS3 elements can be used with www.css3pie.com
16:47  NET||abuse: put the right div first in the html order
16:47  MauriceJ: Maurice: No, not at the moment, why?
16:48  NET||abuse: iaj, so put #rechts first in the code before "inhalt"
16:49  iaj: NET||abuse: did.. but still nothing works out :\
16:49  lxsameer: how can i align a div in center of screen (left right top bottom)?
16:49  NET||abuse: iaj, hmm
16:49  NET||abuse: the problem is you're looking for an elastic solution here.
16:49  NET||abuse: i guess.. you could look at the css gallery for layouts
16:50  NET||abuse: will give you the principle to get it right here
16:50  iaj: mhhh thanks, you got an url for me?
16:51  dravekx: things that make you go Hmmmmm.

16:56  urker: hi, I need help, this is my markup: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01P . how do i remove the "white line" between the two bars?
16:57  urker: the long horizontal
16:58  urker: if i remove the float:left from .tab_selected and .tab, the line is gone but mess the markup
16:59  dravekx: whitey liney.
17:00  ZombieLoffe: urker: margin-bottom: -1px; on .tab_selected a
17:00  ZombieLoffe: urker: also, wtf is .tab_selected herf? :P
17:01  iaj: NET||abuse: was trying to find something that suit my needs, but aren't those thingies fixed width as well?
17:02 --- curt`off is now known as Curt`
17:03  dravekx: Lol.
17:04  NET||abuse: iaj, is there not one there that suits the layout your looking at?
17:04  urker: ZombieLoffe, great! thanks. forget about the herf :) anyway can you explain wher this "line" came from?
17:04  dravekx: urker, actually... you could remove .tab_selected a, .tab_selected herf {border-top} ... which is causing the white line.
17:04  NET||abuse: iaj, http://layouts.ironmyers.com/100_percent_Layouts/layout/?id=5
17:04  aitiba: How can I put an image before another image when I dont use position? So if i use position I cant use z-index how can I fix it please
17:05  ZombieLoffe: urker: It comes from .tab_selected a being 1 px higher than the other <a>s because of the border-top

17:09  iaj: NET||abuse: hmm that doesn't really help me since that secondary column is used anyway - all the time :\ isn't it?
17:10  dravekx: ...
17:13  NET||abuse: iaj, oh wait, you want something that will just expand full width if nothing is to the right?
17:13  NET||abuse: iaj, i didn't understand that requirement earlier
17:13  iaj: NET||abuse: yeah...
17:13  iaj: well the left side acutally - right is always there
17:13  NET||abuse: iaj, i don't think you can do that easily.
17:13  iaj: but that doesn't matter, if theres a solution to that problem
17:14  iaj: NET||abuse: doh :'(
17:14  iaj: would be too amazing since I'm just trying to set up a typosite
17:20  NET||abuse: iaj, just checked this, it works  http://paste.pocoo.org/show/318342
17:21  NET||abuse: iaj, just deleting the right
17:21  NET||abuse: iaj, just deleting the #right div, the left fills out to the right for the full width

17:33  Bartzy: li:active is not supported in IE? even 8 ?
17:34  tw2113: i wouldn't doubt it
17:34  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy: Uhh.. li:active makes no sense.
17:34  Bartzy: Why not ?
17:34  ZombieLoffe: :active selects an anchor or button currently being activated, eg. clicked on. You can't activate lis.
17:34  Bartzy: It's the li being pressed right now
17:34  Bartzy: why not
17:35  ZombieLoffe: Because li is not an activatable control
17:35  Bartzy: ok
17:35  Bartzy: it works on all browsers except IE.. but I'll change
17:35  Bartzy: and li:hover is fine ?
17:35  ZombieLoffe: It's not standard behaviour
17:35  ZombieLoffe: Sure
17:36  Bartzy: ZombieLoffe: #zone_bar li a img {}
17:36  Bartzy: is that really ineffective ?
17:36  Bartzy: or I won't notice ?
17:36  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy: Nothing wrong with it
17:36  Bartzy: Cause I have quite a few of those and I don't really know if it's bad.. don't want to use '>' because I think IE6 & 7 doesn't support it ? Maybe just 6 ?
17:36  Bartzy: ok
17:38  Bartzy: ZombieLoffe: So whatever:hover is just for IE6 ?
17:38  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy: yes
17:38  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy: And there's nothing ineffective about that selector, it's perfectly fine.
17:39  Bartzy: It searches the DOM really bad lol
17:39  Bartzy: #zone_bar li a.active_zone
17:39  Bartzy: this for example
17:39  Bartzy: it's totally fine to use it ? In a CSS with 2000+ lines :|
17:39  ZombieLoffe: Yes.
17:39  Bartzy: ok, thanks a lot.
17:39  Bartzy: you know too much
17:39  Bartzy: ;p
17:39  ZombieLoffe: Heh
17:41  Bartzy: ZombieLoffe: and a#sketch_zone
17:41  Bartzy: this is just stupid right ?
17:42  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy: Not necessarily, but nine times out of ten you just need #sketch_zone.
17:42  Bartzy: I mean it's easier to see that #sketch_zone is <a>, but I shouldn't use it ?
17:42  Bartzy: Oh for specifity..
17:42  Bartzy: or however you say it
17:42  ZombieLoffe: Not necessarily for specificity either
17:42  Bartzy: so for what ?
17:43  ZombieLoffe: Using element#id could be useful if you include the same CSS file on multiple HTML documents, on one document the id is applied to one type of element, and in the next a different type
17:44  webPragmatist: can you pad something without having it's width be changed?

19:17  sorush20: I've read inhereted in wc3, but I still don't understand it, can anyone tell me what inherited means?
19:20  sriley: it gets its value from its parent
19:20  ZombieLoffe: sorush20: Some properties are automatically passed on from parent to descendant -- color for instance. So if you have <p>Hello world <span>Foo bar</span></p> in the HTML and p { color: red; } in the CSS, both <p>'s and the <span>'s text will be red -- The color property is inherited.
19:21  sorush20: okay thanks
19:24  Bartzy: Anyone knows about IE7 z-index bug ?
19:27  sriley: the one that gives any element with any non static positioning a zindex? and so all child zindexes are relative to their parent positioned element, not the parent zindexed element?

19:38  iaj: blackice2999: huh? :)
19:38  iaj: tried that with first-child but it only worked once..
19:39  blackice2999: iaj: you want every div in #foobar (first hierarchy ?) or only the first div  on paralell level ?
19:39  iaj: the first upcoming div after a div.foobar
19:40  blackice2999: hmm
19:41  blackice2999: iaj: div.foobar > div are all divs in foobar but only on the first level. Only the first div in foobar i think its not possible because :first-child uses the first element but i think thats can be a other than a div element right ?

21:26 --- Channel #css was synced in 113 seconds
21:26  naton: Carneque: yes, like Trident in IE or Gecko in Firefox
21:27  Bartzy: I have a problem with max-width and max-height on a <div>
21:27  Bartzy: it's a <div> that contains an image...
21:27  naton: Carneque: what i meant is that you could animate that black/white thingie using CSS on Webkit browsers
21:27  naton: but that would ignore others so..
21:28  Bartzy: the image is smaller than the max-width and max-height set in the <div>.. and has max-width & max-height set the same
21:28  Bartzy: But the <div> width & height are always the max-width & height.. it never "adapts" to the image size. The image does scale according to max-width & height.
21:28  Carneque: The nice thing about JQuery is that it's mostly the same behavior among the major browsers
21:29  naton: Carneque: yes, but hovering is a concept that CSS does very fast, if performance is your concern
21:30  Carneque: yep, it would be if people didn't like such shiny things :/
21:30  naton: Carneque: as animations? yeah, guess so.
21:31  naton: you could argue that people that like shiny things the most are the same that uses Chrome or Safari though
21:31  naton: IE6 users probably don't know what a smooth animation is anyway

21:37  systemfault: *matter
21:37  Bartzy: anyone about max-width & max-height question ? :|
21:37  systemfault: Firefox has never been good... just better than IE.
21:37  naton: i ran Mozilla 1.0.3 or something, on my PowerBook 3400 over a modem in Lyon 2003.. those were the days :P
21:38  dravekx: <systemfault, i disagree.
21:38  systemfault: dravekx: How is firefox a good browser, tell me.
21:40  dravekx: How is it not? Everything about it spells 'greater than" when you run a full comparison to any other browser on the market.
21:40  systemfault: Chrome is better. Way better.
21:40  dravekx: no. Chrome is newer, not better.
21:40  Carneque: I live the developer tools personally
21:40  systemfault: Even safari would be better if it had as much extensions
21:40  Carneque: on Firefox
21:41  dravekx: Who uses Chrome for dev and design?
21:41  systemfault: Me.
21:41  systemfault: And probably a lot of people
21:41  dravekx: that sucks.
21:42  Bartzy: You can't use :active on <button> in IE7 ?
21:42  naton: the new tools in webkit's inspector (nightly, from mid december) are really cool. firebug still has an advantage in some areas (updating the DOM window e.g.) but lags too much
21:43  dravekx: http://www.lucidsense.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/browser.png
21:43  systemfault: naton: I'm using dev :)
21:43  systemfault: *chrome dev
21:43  naton: chrome's inspector is however not as good as safari's since it reloads the dom when opening the inspector window
21:43  naton: so nightlies it is.
21:44  systemfault: I'd probably use safari if I had a mac at work.
21:44  dravekx: firefox + firebug > all. I have yet to see anything compare.
21:44  naton: systemfault: it helps, yeah
21:44  systemfault: Because you didn't try anything else.
21:44  systemfault: Firebug has 2 advantages over the chrome dev tools imho.
21:45  naton: dravekx: i have it too, but find myself spending more time in webkit nowadays
21:45  naton: mostly due to performance
21:45  steveoh_: can anyone make some css book recommendations
21:45  systemfault: 1) It shows XHRs as JSON  2) You don't need to press enter or click somewhere else to apply a style to an element.
21:46  naton: plus, i'm using it to debug webkit animations ;)
21:46  oojacoboo: the [type] selector, does it have IE7 compat?
21:46  oojacoboo: IIRC it does
21:46  dravekx: "<systemfault> Because you didn't try anything else."
21:47  dravekx: lol. ignorance.
21:47  oojacoboo: nm, I see it does
21:47  systemfault: Well, I don't think so as I can tell you what I prefer from each. You.. it's just "I like it because... because..."
21:48  dravekx: Chrome is nothing more than a basic speed demon for kiddy browsing.
21:48  dravekx: other than that, it's worthless
21:48  naton: dravekx: i think i know what i'm talking about though. i have most dev tools to most browsers on most OSes on my Mac and I still think Firebug uses too much CPU to stand working in it
21:48  systemfault: Heh.. fanboyism
21:49  oojacoboo: what's the point of... E[attr~="name"]
21:49  dravekx: naton, it does, but it works.
21:49  naton: "works" is not something i cans stand :)
21:49  systemfault: Until you have to restart the browser because the slowness becomes unbearable.
21:49  naton: *can
21:49  naton: it has to be damn speedy too
21:50  systemfault: And you see that it takes... 2GB of ram :P
21:50  naton: seriously, try yesterday's Webkit and open up the Audit tab e.g.
21:50  naton: you just don't have that kind of stuff in Firebug
21:50  naton: or the new Net tab
21:50  systemfault: Even even the profiler in chrome..
21:50  naton: it's Firebug + YSlow + more
21:51  dravekx: I've never had a problem with firefox unless you are trying to load a spammed bloatware site like myspace. then it tends to flake out.
21:52  systemfault: dravekx: I never got a crash of Firefox... just memory leak problems.
21:52  Carneque: Sweet guys I actually found a jQuery Background Position plugin that is going to work across all browsers, regardless of your preferences of use!
21:52  Carneque: haha
21:52  systemfault: Ah.. well, 2-3 crashes a few years ago.. but it was because of flash.
21:53  dravekx: speaking of crashing with flash... Chrome. I guess they are behind, but catching up fast. Soon they will be bloated and something else will emerge.
21:54  systemfault: They're not behind.. they even cooperate with adobe to fix problems..
21:54  dravekx: that's their first mistake. lol.
21:54  systemfault: Indeed..
21:55  systemfault: I think that too.

22:09  _ZofBot4: Seppoz, Same height columns: http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight  http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/ | non-IE less than 8-friendly: http://zoffix.com/new/sameheight.html
22:09  ravenzz: same dics
22:09  Seppoz: ahh found it, used table row containing 2 table cells
22:09  Seppoz: thanks
22:10  Seppoz: mean table
22:11  sriley: dont use tables for layout
22:12  Seppoz: well im using div saying display:table-row;
22:12  Seppoz: is that wrong too?
22:12  oksushi: no
22:12  sriley: thats okish, but wont work in ie
22:12  Seppoz: oh, let me see
22:12  Seppoz: well in this case it seems that it even does!
22:14  Seppoz: thank you very much guys!
22:14  Seppoz: i really need some practice in css
22:17  Seppoz: whats the propper way of doing .api_results .alt_on:hover, .alt_off:hover { i mean defining the same css for 2 subclasses
22:17  Seppoz: .api_results .alt_on:hover, .api_results .alt_off:hover?
22:19  caution: how do you reset the style for an element?
22:20  Seppoz: dont think you can do that actually, maybe you can just make a temp class and then reload the old? or save the old and the reload it?
22:21  oksushi: Seppoz: yes, the second
22:21  oksushi: caution: you can use the 'initial' keyword, however you are better to not select the element in the first place
22:21  caution: thanks
22:22  Seppoz: oksushi: thanks
22:22  caution: is that CSS3 only though?
22:23  oksushi: sure
22:24  kn100: I've got a container div and floated divs within that container
22:24  kn100: how can I get teh container to take the width of the things within it
22:24  oksushi: kn100: by floating it as well
22:24  oksushi: ]css shrink wrap @ kn100
22:24  _ZofBot4: kn100, CSS Shrink Wrap: http://www.brunildo.org/test/ ,  http://www.brunildo.org/test/shrink-to-fit.html
22:24  kn100: oksushi, really? it's that simple...LOL
22:25  kn100: next silly situation
22:28  kn100: I've got a container div that's floated left as part of a layout, within that are two divs that are not floated, just in there
22:28  kn100: and container div doesn't take width of things within it for some reason
22:28  xorred: does anyone know how is this menu style called /technique/ so I could read about it and learn how to do it in Wordpress?  like on that URL here > http://www.ankerweb.com/rj/home01.htm
22:28  oksushi: kn100: you need to provide the url
22:29  kn100: ok, let me scp it somewhere
22:29  oksushi: xorred: you mean http://www.useit.com/alertbox/mega-dropdown-menus.html ?
22:33  Seppoz: is it possible to tell a div to be as hight as the div left to it?
22:33  Seppoz: intention is to vertical center the content
22:33  Bartzy: Anyway to create Inner shadow in IE ?
22:33  oksushi: ]vertcenter @ Seppoz
22:33  _ZofBot4: Seppoz, CSS Vertical Center: Tutorial: http://haslayout.net/css-tuts/Vertical-Centering Examples: http://zoffix.com/new/css-vertical-center.html , http://reisio.com/examples/vertcenter/
22:33  oksushi: Bartzy: what do you think
22:33  Bartzy: oksushi :(
22:34  Bartzy: oksushi: Maybe with filter or something ?
22:34  oksushi: what are you doing with inner shadow?
22:35  Bartzy: Making some kind of "bevel" (3d) feel on a div
22:35  oksushi: Bartzy: you could attempt something like this http://nick-dunn.co.uk/article/cross-browser-drop-shadows-using-pure-css/
22:38  Bartzy: thanks.
22:40  kn100: Someone in here linked an article called overflow magic
22:41  kn100: it was a factoid I believe
22:41  oksushi: kn100: http://colinaarts.com/articles/the-magic-of-overflow-hidden/
22:41  kn100: That's the one oksushi <3
22:41  bonhoffer: so i am having ie trouble -- is there a firebug equivalent for i.e.
22:41  bonhoffer: the site is www.crossfitadaptation.com
22:42  oksushi: ]ie debug @ bonhoffer
22:42  _ZofBot4: bonhoffer, IE Debug tools: Best(Visual Studio): http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/ , OK and Free(Script Debugger): http://xrl.us/sr7a , Leak Detector: http://outofhanwell.com/ieleak/index.php?title=Main_Page
22:42  bonhoffer: with ie, the right side floats are pushed below all the content
22:42  bonhoffer: thanks
22:42  oksushi: bonhoffer: http://www.westciv.com/xray/ http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
22:42  oksushi: bonhoffer: but your issue is:
22:43  oksushi: YOU HAVE NO DOCTYPE
22:43  oksushi: http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=http://www.crossfitadaptation.com/&ucn_task=conformance
22:43  bonhoffer: oops -- i know i need to validate
22:43  oksushi: silly, silly bonhoffer
22:43  bonhoffer: sorry -- i should have done that before coming here
22:43 * oksushi nods
22:44  bonhoffer: oksushi: do you have a doctype you would recommend based on what you've seen
22:44  oksushi: <!DOCTYPE html>
22:44  bonhoffer: i tend to do xhtml transitional -- but that would be better, thanks
22:45  oksushi: transitional is for people transitioning from older versions of html
22:45  oksushi: (thus the name)
22:45  grunge: oksushi, why html5?
22:45  oksushi: why not?
22:46  oksushi: any valid HTML4 page can have an HTML5 doctype and still be valid
22:47  RobW: can someone help me figure out why the footer collapse/expand icon disappears momentarily when the footer div is in animation? http://lifecouldbebetter.com/
22:54  bonhoffer: oksushi: what are the two numbers on the left with the html errors
22:54  bonhoffer: line number and ?
22:54  bonhoffer: (column)
22:56  kn100: argh
22:56  kn100: why doesn't overflow:hidden work in IE6
22:56  kn100: actually, none of the IE versions seem to render that right
22:57  kn100: can someone explain why the div on the left in chrome drops down to the height of the div on the right but on IE it doesn't?
22:57  chombee: Hey, is it possible to make a paragraph or a div vertically-align with the bottom of its parent div?
22:57  oksushi: kn100: read this: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
22:57  kn100: the text in the div on the right just wraps around the div on the left
22:58  oksushi: specifically the part 'solutions for legacy versions of Internet explorer'
22:58  kn100: oksushi, reading...
22:58  oksushi: ]h @ kn100
22:58  _ZofBot4: kn100, IE hasLayout: http://haslayout.net/haslayout
22:58  oksushi: also this ^^
22:58  chombee: The situation is that I have a div with a fixed size and a background image, I want a paragraph inside this div to be clamped to the bottom of the  div rather than the top
22:58  oksushi: ]css put bottom @ chombee
22:58  _ZofBot4: chombee, Put #foo to the bottom of #container: <div id="container"><p id="foo">lal</p></div>  #container{position: relative;} #foo{position: absolute; bottom: 0;} /* IE may need either `left` or `right` as well */
22:59  NickASloan: is it possible to use a sprite map which has sprites arranged vertically every X pixels on a container with height > X?
22:59  NickASloan: basically to only show a background image from A to A + X
23:00  chombee: _ZofBot4: Worked! Thanks
23:06  bonhoffer: anyone know how to fix a DOUBLE_WHITESPACE in PATH.
23:07  ZombieLoffe: say what?
23:07  oksushi: by removing the double whitespace in the path
23:07  bonhoffer: it is preventing www.crossfitadaptation.com
23:07  bonhoffer: oksushi: i don't see it there
23:08  oksushi: why do thaose links have title attributes?
23:08  oksushi: title attribute text should not just copy the link text
23:09  bonhoffer: oksushi: where is the double_whitespace?
23:09  oksushi: bonhoffer: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200903/dont_duplicate_link_text_in_the_title_attribute/
23:10  oksushi: bonhoffer: did you remove the white space at the end of the URL in the href attribute? I see white space there
23:10  bonhoffer: oh, i see it -- straight wordpress
23:10  bonhoffer: just in the title
23:10  bonhoffer: oh -- i'm out of power
23:10  oksushi: hah
23:10  oksushi: silly robots
23:11  Jayflux: has there been a solution to constantly copying css rules which have similar classes?
23:11  Jayflux: i heards about oocss but not tryed it
23:12  oksushi: there is no 'solution' required. CSS itself can solve the issue
23:12  oksushi: you can extract common styles out, then use a number of selectors, separated by commas, to apply that css
23:12  oojacoboo: Jayflux: lesscss.org is pretty nice, although, requires compiling on the server
23:13  oksushi: .class1, .class2, .class3 {border-radius: 10px;}
23:13  Jayflux: yeah oksushi i do a lot of that but doesnt seem to help a massive amount
23:29  ronghail: input { background: #FFCC00; }    if I put some buttons inside a div, do I use a class or an id so I only affect those input buttons in the div?
23:29  Bartzy: There's no way to get IE to display shadow on a box on all edges ?
23:30  Bartzy: I tried to create 2 boxes (one before the other) and set 2 shadows : 1 top-left, 1 bottom-right...
23:30  Bartzy: but both display to the top-left for some reason.
23:30  oksushi: ronghail: div.className input {}
23:30  oksushi: ]css select @ ronghail
23:30  _ZofBot4: ronghail, CSS Selectors: 1) read: http://xrl.us/bemweo [CSS2.1] http://xrl.us/bemwem [CSS3], http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/ , http://www.csarven.ca/css-specificity-and-selectors 2) Try it out: http://penguin.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py
23:34  ronghail: thanks
23:44  ronghail: div.foo input { background: #FFCC00; }      <div classname="foo">   forms here   </div>    not working.  take out div.foo and all buttons get the background color, in or out of div.  with div.foo none are colored
23:47  oksushi: ronghail: class="foo" not classname="foo"
23:47  oksushi: duh
23:55  dravekx: foo*d
23:59  Bartzy: Anyway to make a style for IE only? some selector?
23:59  Bartzy: IE8 and older... but without conditional statements ?
