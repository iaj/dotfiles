09:08  webresourc: how can I fix this issue ?
09:08  Lazylegs: webresourc, what ie version?
09:08  webresourc: I can't find out the solution to this problem
09:08  webresourc: Internet Explorer v8
09:09  webresourc: but I'm not sure for older versions how they behave
09:09  Lazylegs: and what is the issue.. drop down on main navigation? Works fine at my end with ie8 and ie7
09:10  webresourc: on sub menu the hover is not working good
09:11  webresourc: normaly each item on submenu must change the background color but for me change only the first element in the sub menu
09:11  Lazylegs: webresourc, ok now I see the problem
09:11 --- Channel #css was synced in 227 seconds
09:13  webresourc: may this will help you
09:13  webresourc: I use the http://lwis.net/free-css-drop-down-menu/ CSS Menu Framework
09:15  Lazylegs: webresourc, odd that it is only at ie8 not 7, and directly do not see any problem with the selector with Firebug
09:15  webresourc: me too
09:15  webresourc: but I don't realy know how to fix this issue
09:15  webresourc: do you have any idea please ?
09:18  Lazylegs: hmmm...
09:25  tomoyuki28jp: IETester crashes too much. Is there any better alternative?
09:26  webresourc: alternative of what ?
09:26  webresourc: what is te IETester ?
09:26  Cork: a compilation of all ie libs today in one application
09:26  tomoyuki28jp: webresourc: google it, sir.
09:26  Cork: so you can test the different ie versions
09:26  Lazylegs: webresourc, http://www.webdevout.net/test?0h your menu in testcase.. no problems.. so some selector is whacking up the whole thing. Am not sure which one
09:26  Cork: its not verry accurate though
09:33  webresourc: :( ? I can't figure out the reason that I have this issue
09:41 --- bsdfoxesRcool is now known as h4x0r`
09:43  Lazylegs: webresourc, the is some z-index clash.. if you disable the ul.dropdown ul {z-index} things sart to work better
09:58  webresourc: I make a hack thru the jQuery
09:58  webresourc: I don't know the reason about the Internet Explorer bug
09:58  webresourc: but I solved thru the jQuery
09:58  webresourc: kind regards :)
10:06  Pinchiukas: How do I use just some portion of an image? Like when using a single file for rounded corners. Can't find an example for that. :)
10:08  fep: When i use div's to place things around on the webpage i have problems everytime i put a new thing in, like a picture.. then i have to redo all the margins and/or paddings
10:08  fep: any advice?
10:35  Shwaiil: Hi ppl
10:36  rimantas: Pinchiukas, you either set padding accordingly, so only the needed part shows up, or use border-image rule http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/
10:37  Pinchiukas: Ačiū :)
10:37  juha_: i have this weird position problem, http://kuvaton.com/k/ezU.jpg
10:39  juha_: the sitechat & global chat are both inside same container div, how can i get them to the bottom of that that div instead of top? vertical-align, position absolute/relative/fixed or negative margins doesn't seem to be helping
10:40  Pinchiukas: rimantas: how do I "set up padding accordingly"? What CSS property?
10:40  Lazylegs: juha_, give the container position: relative; and then use position: absolute; bottom: 0; for chats
10:41  jedmund: hello dear friends, I have a <div> that has an unspecified amount of elements inside. I want to display them next to each other with even widths, is this possible with css magic?
10:41  juha_: Lazylegs: now the whole thing disappears..
10:42  jedmund: heres a sample, the element in question is in the top right: http://dev.getfoundation.com/admin/create
10:42  jedmund: except its hard coded there
10:42  Lazylegs: juha_, you got url?
10:42  juha_: Lazylegs: http://socialbar.dogfight.fi/
10:42  jedmund: what i want is for if i add a third element, the widths to change accordingly
10:42  juha_: Lazylegs: in order to see the chats, you should login with fb account (just make one up if you don't want to use your own)

10:50  rimantas: Pinchiukas, padding :)
10:54  Clorith: I'd liek to make a box that stays i nthe lower right of a screne ,regardless of scrolling etc, would that be a css or javascript solution? (I'm not entirely sure what I'm googling for in terms here)
10:55  juha_: Clorith: position: fixed; bottom: 0; right: 0;
10:57  Clorith: juha_: would I need to use that as the last element on my page, or could I place it where ever?
10:59  juha_: Clorith: use where ever
11:01  Clorith: Thanks =) Much appreciated
11:01  Pinchiukas: rimantas: I think I remember someone using some kind of offsets to the background file I just can't find it.
11:02  fep: When i use div's to place things around on the webpage i have problems everytime i put a new thing in, like a picture.. then i have to redo all the margins and/or paddings ... any adivce?
11:04  Clorith: overflow: none; ?
11:06  Pinchiukas: I think facebook also has a lot of images on a single file, I'll take a look.
11:09  rimantas: Pinchiukas, you can google for the term CSS sprites
11:10  Pinchiukas: I'll try that.
11:21  timing: Hi guys, is this the best way to have two columns where the left column has a fixed width and the right column takes all the other space? http://jsfiddle.net/timing/dCext/
11:25  Neillithan: timing: first of all, I would stop using ID's for something a class can handle.
11:26  timing: Neillithan: first of all, it's an example :-)
11:26  Neillithan: still.
11:27  Neillithan: another thing, I would avoid using absolute.  reason being is anything with absolute positioning will not stretch to the height of its contents.
11:28  timing: yeah, I'm not a fan of absolute either, but currently I don't know better :-)
11:28  timing: I can use fixed? but that's just the same in this case?
11:29  Neillithan: fixed works similarly to absolute.  My recommendation would be to use float or something else.
11:29  timing: but if I float the content it's becoming very small
11:29  Lazylegs: timing, using floats: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0i
11:30  timing: Lazylegs: it uses IDs o no!
11:30  timing: but thanks!
11:31  Lazylegs: Oh no! Ofcourse it uses ID's :D
11:31  Lazylegs: There is no single good reason why it would not use id's :)
11:33  timing: thanks for backing me up ;-)
11:33  Neillithan: the reason you should not use ID for visual styling is because they cannot be reused.  If it's for something you do not plan to reuse, then it doesn't matter.  However, it's still a good practice to use classes instead of id's
11:35  timing: Lazylegs: thanks, this looks way better!
11:36  timing: Lazylegs: I was this far too, but I didn't do height: 100% on html
11:37  Neillithan: timing: word of caution.  That example page uses overflow:hidden on the container.  Overflow hidden prevents absolute positioned elements from escaping the container.
11:37  Neillithan: timing: in other words, if you try to position anything with negative margins or negative positioning outside of the container, it will be clipped
11:37  timing: ok, thanks
11:38  Lazylegs: Neillithan, still there is no any good reason why ID's could not be used for styling an structural elements etc...
11:38  Neillithan: to prevent that, instead of using overflow hidden, specify a margin-left on the container equal to the width of your sidebar
11:39  yt_ror: How can I make a div appear as if is sliding upwards when someone clicks a button ?
11:39  yt_ror: I want to put it inside a div and hiden overflow and when an event is fired I want it ti slide up
11:40  Neillithan: Lazylegs: I already stated.  If you use IDs for styling on elements used only one time anywhere in a document, then it doesn't matter.  In other words, there's nothing wrong with it.  But you would be better off using a class instead because then you can put the same type of styling across other elements in the page.  Example, borders on header/middle/footer can all be the same by using a class
11:40  Neillithan: instead of an ID.
11:40  timing: Neillithan: http://jsfiddle.net/timing/dCext/6/ This is what I have now
11:40  Neillithan: Lazylegs: you can even further differentiate things by using multiple classes per element.
11:40  Lazylegs: Neillithan, I know these things
11:41  Neillithan: well you make it hard to believe.
11:41  Lazylegs: It does make all sense
11:41  timing: guys, shut up!
11:41  Lazylegs: :)
11:41  timing: you are both helping me, so in the same situation
11:42  Neillithan: timing: what else do you need to do to it?
11:43  timing: Neillithan: well, I didn't add the margin-left there, I wonder if your explanation about negative margins still applies to my version
11:43  Neillithan: timing: here, I'll show you an example
11:44  Lazylegs: I hardly want to have two .wrapper elements on my page.. so i still go with #wrapper selector. and I like to have high specificity on unique elements at page
11:44  Neillithan: timing: http://jsfiddle.net/dCext/7/
11:44  Neillithan: timing: notice how the floating red box is now clipped?
11:44  timing: yeah
11:44  timing: but that's an expected behaviour I think?
11:44  Neillithan: timing: if you don't mind that, then it's not a problem.
11:44  Neillithan: timing: that's an intended behavior of using overflow:hidden, but that's an unintended behavior of having a column layout using overflow
11:45  timing: and what would happen if you use the margin-left thing?
11:45  Neillithan: without overflow?
11:46  Neillithan: http://jsfiddle.net/dCext/7/
11:46  Neillithan: also, notice how you no longer have double scrollbars.
11:46  timing: it's still the same?
11:46  Neillithan: http://jsfiddle.net/dCext/8/
11:46  Neillithan: ^
11:46  Neillithan: my bad.
11:46  timing: ah ofcourse
11:47  timing: O that's not what I want :-)
11:47  timing: but thanks, I learned something today

12:43  timing: I'm now trying to add that #header, but #left and #content should not have a 100% height now
12:43  timing: is there a solution for this without using position: absolute ?

13:20  Ezdaroth: What would be the best way to make a div take all the available space? Like in most of the applications there's a toolbar on top, sometimes on the sides and bottom. I'm talking about the area in the middle of everything.
13:21  Ezdaroth: Is it possible without javascript or a table?
13:21  nkuttler: Ezdaroth: hm?
13:22  nkuttler: Ezdaroth: absolute/fixed positioning?
13:22  Kafetist: there was a nice tip page about it somewhere
13:23  milleja46: still can't figure out why on webdevout the navigation and main content are beside each other,  but when i put it on my xampp testing server, and add some navigation css code the navigation goes above it......
13:23  Ezdaroth: Yeah, but the toolbars would have dynamic width/height and I wouldn't want the "viewport" to go under the toolbars.
13:25  nkuttler: Ezdaroth: sounds like a javascript job
13:25  milleja46: this is what i get on webdevout,  but in xampp the thing that says content and is a little bolded is the navigation, and the other part is the main content of the page http://www.webdevout.net/test?01e
13:26  milleja46: but it doesn't come up right at all
13:26  ZombieLoffe: milleja46, <p> inside <h4> is invalid
13:27  nkuttler: Ezdaroth: or still absolute/fixed positioning but with excessive size maybe
13:27  milleja46: oh...maybe i should remove that, i tried that to last night and it didn't fix it i'm gonna try again....
13:28  ZombieLoffe: milleja46, also, #h4 would select <element id="h4">, not <h4>. If you want to select an element, use its tag name, eg h4 {}
13:28  Kafetist: Ezdaroth: maybe min-height: 100% ?

13:29  lukus: http://html5boilerplate.com/
13:29  lukus: a good thing? ^^
13:29  milleja46: yeah but zombieloffe, i think this is part code that you gave me last night, and i edited it last night nad after i did it went all weird and on different lines in xampp
13:29  ZombieLoffe: milleja46: Make sure it validates. :P
13:30  Ezdaroth: Kafetist: I don't want the document to overflow. Only the area in the middle should. I know it's possible with a table, but don't know any solution for divs.
13:30  Ezdaroth: Also even tho the whole application requires javascript, I wouldn't want to calculate the div width/height if there's any other way.
13:31  Kafetist: but the 100% is in relation to the containing object, so how would it overflow?
13:32  Kafetist: if I remember correctly that would work even if the containing object resized after render
13:32  Kafetist: at least it worked if it grew =)
13:33  milleja46: what does: Using Direct Input mode: UTF-8 character encoding assumed and No Character encoding declared at document level mean?
13:34  Kafetist: wouldn't that mean you're missing <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> ?
13:34  Kafetist: I don't think you can declare charset in CSS anyway
13:35  Kafetist: if you can it must be CSS3 because I've never heard of such
13:35  Ezdaroth: Yeah I think that's what I'm looking for. Just thought min-height would force the element to that size like height. That solves it for the top/bottom toolbars. Would min-width make the div scale properly if there's toolbars on the left or right side?
13:35  milleja46: well that's what came up when i validated the html stuff
13:35  milleja46: i'm about to leave school time
13:35  Kafetist: well do you have it?
13:35  Kafetist: milleja46:
13:35  milleja46: no just added it
13:36  Kafetist: Ezdaroth: haven't used the min- or max- that much even with the height, just read a tutorial about it like a week ago
13:37  Kafetist: you might wanna google about it before working with ti =)
13:38  Ezdaroth: Ok, read that there's a few problems with IE in that solution and it kind of feels like a hack. Hate that it would work perfectly and easily with just one table, but don't really want to go there.
13:40  yt_ror: if I have a div outside a main div and I want to hide it from sjowing.  Do i put the overflow: hidden; on the div that contains the div or the main ?
13:40  Kafetist: well, as you *require* javascript anyway, you might wanna give that a try
13:41  Kafetist: 4.8% of people use IE6, which doesn't support min- or max-'es
13:42  Kafetist: according to Browser Statistics @ www.w3schools.com
13:42  Kafetist: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
13:44  Ezdaroth: Yeah, found a working example where content has min-height in between header and footer and everything seems to scale right. However, I'd need the same scaling horizontally and can't really find anything that does both.
13:44  Kafetist: you got the same amount of people who don't use javascript, but who knows, they might be the exact same audience ;)
13:44  Kafetist: min-width?
13:45  Kafetist: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/30-the-css-layout-model-boxes-border/#minandmax

14:31  ZombieLoffe: Compare the definitions on w3schools and in the spec.
14:32  AndChat|: What's wrong about it is that it states that no floated elements are allowed next to it, which is wrong as it only applies to preceding floats.
14:32  Neillithan: I see nothing inherently wrong with their description

14:56  Reign1: body, html { height: 100%; font: Verdana 76%; } <-- why doesnt my font gets Verdana?
14:58  Neillithan: ZombieLoffe: Okay, I'm back from breakfast and I have taken the time to read the w3.org explanation of the <b> tag
15:00  Neillithan: from what I gather, the w3.org details possible usage scenarios for the b tag outside the normal use (bolding).  It points out that <b> tags can be used in other ways besides just bolding text by applying a class.  the w3schools explanation, however is simpler.  It explains the default visual style of the <b> tag.
15:00  ZombieLoffe: It's _wrong_
15:00  ZombieLoffe: The default visual style of <b> doesn't have to be bold, and it's not is purpose to bolden text

15:01  Neillithan: I realize that, but what I said is *not* wrong.  w3schools was telling what it does, not how it's intended to be used.

15:02  ZombieLoffe: Reign1: the font shorthand requires more properties
15:02  Reign1: ZombieLoffe seems so, tho i was sure it is enough :) ty
15:02  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: That's pretty retarded. It teachers its readers lies and bad practice.
15:03  Reign1: like heres an example from your link: p { font: 80% sans-serif }
15:03  Neillithan: I guess the real question is, why use <b> for anything other than bold when you can simply use <span> with a class?
15:03  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: Why use presentational html ever? :P
15:04  ZombieLoffe: Reign1: Oh, right, my bad. Well, switch the order, then -- font: 76% verdana;
15:04  Reign1: hehe, got it ;)
15:05  Neillithan: ZombieLoffe: but do you understand my point? span does pretty the same thing as b but without the bold
15:05  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: No, that's WRONG
15:05  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan, <b> has semantic meaning in html5
15:05  ZombieLoffe: (even if it's vague and pretty silly)
15:06  Juandev: how to work with class that includess dots?
15:06  Neillithan: personally, I *never* use b unless I'm writing something quick for an article for the homepage.  otherwise, I take the time to create a class that sets the font-weight
15:06  ZombieLoffe: Juandev: class names can't contain dots, afaik
15:06  Cork: Juandev: clases shoudn't ever include dots
15:07  Juandev: umm, its pregenerated to me
15:07  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: You should never use presentational html ever... it's that simple :P
15:07  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: And the point is that in html4 <b> is presentational  -- in html5 it's not
15:08  Juandev: so can I select eight li in the and style it?
15:08  Juandev: something like .sidebar ul li + li + li?
15:09  ZombieLoffe: Juandev: You could escape the dot in the CSS I guess -- like, <p class="he.llo">, select it using .he\.llo {}
15:09  ZombieLoffe: Juandev: CSS3 has :nth-child, so li:nth-child(8) would select it. Else you could do what you said, li + li + li... etc.
15:10  ZombieLoffe: Juandev: Or, if you want IE support and to keep it simple, assign an id or class to the 8th li.
15:10  Juandev: huh, further help, let me apply something
15:10  selckin: http://jsfiddle.net/LvEFw/ why is .term not at full opacity?
15:11  Juandev: ZombieLoffe: I cant edit the code, so let me try the firt option
15:11  ZombieLoffe: Juandev: Because opacity is applied to the parent element, meaning all its contents will be at .5 opacity. You can't revert opacity on a child element.
15:13  selckin: ZombieLoffe: thanks, i basicly just want to reduce opacity on  any text not in .term without wrapping it aswel, guess it's not possible?
15:13  ZombieLoffe: oh, sorry, yeah that was at selckin not at Juandev. Heh.
15:13  Juandev: ya
15:13  ZombieLoffe: selckin: Well, you could just apply it to another child element
15:14  ZombieLoffe: selckin, eg <span class="foo">foobar</span>
15:14  ZombieLoffe: er, failpaste
15:14  ZombieLoffe: selckin, eg http://jsfiddle.net/LvEFw/1/
15:15  Juandev: ha, cool this works:
15:15  Juandev: #n-P\.C5\.99ihl\.C3\.A1sit-se a {
15:15  selckin: ZombieLoffe: yeah was trying to avoid that because of how it's build up server side, but i guess its my only option, thanks
15:16  Neillithan: ZombieLoffe: I still do not understand the significant difference between <b> and <span>  in my eyes, If I wanted to make font bold in the easiest way possible without signifying it's importance, I would just use <b> with the default browser style.  If I wanted text to have a different color, or visually different, I would use <span>.  I would not use <b> for any other purpose.   In fact, I would
15:16  Neillithan: prefer never to use <b> ever.
15:17  ZombieLoffe: Neillithan: Read the fucking html5 spec
15:17  ZombieLoffe: god.
15:17  Neillithan: I did read it. It's bologna
15:17  ZombieLoffe: It's the spec :P
15:17  Neillithan: It's unimportant.
15:17  ZombieLoffe: ...
15:17  Neillithan: I know, I know
15:17  Neillithan: lol
15:17  pensfan: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02C&raw <--- can anyone help me make the inner div fit 100%?
15:18  ZombieLoffe: Yeah, the spec is unimportant. Why not just use <penis> and style it any way you want?
15:18  Neillithan: I have read both the html5 <b> tag and the <span> tag.  Both say essentially the same thing but with different words.
15:18  ZombieLoffe: pensfan: .view { width: 100%; } ?
15:20  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, sorry height wise
15:20  pensfan: i want it to fit in its parent dive
15:20  pensfan: div
15:20  ZombieLoffe: right
15:20  pensfan: and take up all but 5 pixels at the top bottom and left hand side, only its needed width, and then another div beside it to the right that takes up the remaining space
15:20  ZombieLoffe: pensfan: position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; would on .view{} would make .view take up the entire height (in proper browsers)
15:21  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, the inner div
15:21  pensfan: the one that has run, local groups, etc
15:21  ZombieLoffe: pensfan, so do the same on the inner div :P
15:21  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, it wont work cause when i go to put in the second div it's all messed up
15:23  ZombieLoffe: pensfan: add position: absolute; and remove margin-bottom: 1000px; -- looks fine on my screen.
15:23  ZombieLoffe: pensfan, on #host_view_scans that is
15:23  pensfan: gimmie a minute i'll setup the rest of it
15:23  pensfan: you'll see where that goes wrong

15:31  ZombieLoffe: right.
15:31  ZombieLoffe: so what's the point of .view?
15:31  pensfan: jquery slight of hand
15:32  ZombieLoffe: Easiest would be to set a width on #host_view_scans and set the same left value on #host_view_scan_view
15:32  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, but how will i know how big hostviewscans should b
15:32  pensfan: e
15:33  pensfan: it might not have all of those in there

15:33  ZombieLoffe: WHy do you want its width to be determined by its contents? That's just silly.
15:33 --- quellhor1t is now known as quellhorst
15:33  ZombieLoffe: I can't see any practical layout where you'd want that.
15:34  ZombieLoffe: Anyway, it can be accomplished by floating and ditching the position: absolute; or using display: table-cell; on both columns.
15:34  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, because we want maximum area to view
15:34  ZombieLoffe: that doesn't make sense.
15:35  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, we need to view as much data as possible in a single screen
15:35  ZombieLoffe: pensfan: and? Why do you want the sidebar to be as wide as its contents?
15:36  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, so that it will provide as much area as possible for the scan view
15:37  ZombieLoffe: pensfan, and what if there's a fuckton of content in the left column?
15:38  pensfan: sure i could make it a max width then ... but there won't be more than logged on users
15:38  ZombieLoffe: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02E&raw
15:39  ZombieLoffe: Won't take up 100% height in IE < 8.
15:40  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, or if in another div that is < 100% of the height it will extend past its parent
15:40  pensfan: nor will you be able to put a margin on it
15:41  Ungy: Ahh Another columns attempt I see
15:41  ZombieLoffe: Sigh.
15:41  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, yeah i don't think this is going to work out
15:41  Ungy: haven't been here in over a year and it is always the same question
15:41  pensfan: Ungy, lol yeah
15:41  ZombieLoffe: pensfan: Rethink your design.
15:42  Ungy: pensfan what you trying to do?
15:43  pensfan: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02D&raw
15:43  pensfan: Ungy, trying to get two columns side by side
15:43  pensfan: taking up all but a 5 pixel padding
15:44  Ungy: the end goal?
15:44  ZombieLoffe: pensfan, didn't I just show you a way to do that?
15:44  pensfan: and the left column should only take up as much as it needs
15:44  pensfan: ZombieLoffe, no you didn't
15:44  Ungy: will column 1 or column 2 always be longer?
15:45  pensfan: Ungy, no
15:45  pensfan: they should have overflow
15:45  pensfan: scrollbar overflow
15:45  Ungy: so tehy will always be the full height?
15:45  pensfan: yes
15:45  Ungy: and both have scroll bar overflow?
15:45  pensfan: yes
15:46  Ungy: interesting
15:46  Ungy: sounds like someone is trying to do frames without using frames ;-)
15:46  pensfan: Ungy, essentially ... i want jquery to implement the view
15:48  Ungy: you want frames design with JQuery doing what for you exactly loading the pseudo frames?
15:48 --- Hutch[S]|away is now known as Hutch[S]
15:49  pensfan: ungy, there are several different sets of data.  each type of data is going to have its own view(host_view_scan_view) will show the appropriate view that goes with that data type
15:49  Ungy: pensfan well if your using javascript anyway just calculate the window height and set divs accordingly
15:51  pensfan: Ungy, that's really ugly ... i don't wanna do that.  i'd rather have a fixed width on the menu ... but i was _strongly_ trying to avoid that.  seems like the least consequential
15:51  Ungy: you can have a fixed width
15:52  Ungy: just have to calculate the height
15:52  pensfan: if i have a fixed width i don't have to calculate the height
15:52  pensfan: i can position it absolutely
15:53  Ungy: did you want the columns to always be full size but scroallable?
15:53  pensfan: okay
15:53  pensfan: yeah
15:53  pensfan: it's okay ... this will work
15:54  Ungy: OK
15:54  Ungy: I think I might not be understanding your eventual goal but if you got somethign that will work then good on you
15:55  pensfan: ungy gimmie a couple minutes and i'll be able to show you
15:57  SixThreeOh: I have a minor aesthetic issue I would like help with: I have a table where the tbody has been given a fixed height, overflow y=auto,x=hidden.. this provides a table with a scrolling body and fized header
15:58  SixThreeOh: The one strange glitch is, that in ff, when I scroll, the borders stay fixed in position.
15:59  nisseni: I've got a weird problem; when I use text-transform: none; in a dropdown menu - one of the menu items breaks a row - however - when I use text-transform: uppercase; which obviously makes the menu item longer - it doesn't break a row... why is that?
15:59  pensfan: Ungy, http://www.webdevout.net/test?02F&raw
15:59  SixThreeOh: Does anyone know a way around this that isn't too much of a kludge?
15:59  Ungy: SixThreeOh I have seen that I removed border on my td and added a div inside with border
16:00  SixThreeOh: That's what I thought of doing...
16:00  SixThreeOh: Perhaps it is the only way
16:01  Ungy: pensfan so you do not want a fixed width left column
16:02  pensfan: right
16:02  Ungy: ahh could get ugly I would set a max-width

16:15  Ungy: Sppom you want a fixed width box with a specific set of lines?
16:15  Spoom: Ungy, yes, think of a sheet of lined paper
16:15  Ungy: how many lines?
16:15  Spoom: 6 in one place, 3 in others, i'm generating a report
16:16  ZombieLoffe: Spoom: Impossible. You don't know what font-size the user will use.
16:16  Ungy: Spoom: hmm well depnding on what you want {width:yoursize; hieght:6em;}
16:17  ZombieLoffe: Spoom: You can certainly do it with a tiled background, but you can't fix the number of lines.
16:17  Ungy: ZombieLoffe: if you do not allow for the user to specify size it is possible
16:17  ZombieLoffe: Ungy: The user can always specify font-size.
16:17  ZombieLoffe: Ungy: And besides, you should never even mess with the user's font-size :P
16:17  Spoom: ZombieLoffe, yeah, that was my main concern when looking around, *but* for this specific report, i'm sending it to a PDF printer immediately, so i actually do and can control the line height etc

16:20  Carmageddon: how do I write a css selector like this: .passform tr:first
16:20  Carmageddon: eg I want only the first tr element
16:21  Ungy: Carmageddon: you want to work in IE6?
16:21  Carmageddon: Ungy dont care its only font size
16:21  ZombieLoffe: Carmageddon, :first-child
16:22  Ungy: table.passform:first-child
16:22  Carmageddon: ZombieLoffe not working :(
16:22  ZombieLoffe: Ungy: that would be wrong.
16:22  Ungy: be careful though if your usig tbody
16:22  Carmageddon: Ungy it is tbody, why the warning?
16:23  ZombieLoffe: Carmageddon: table tr:first-child {} will select the first <tr> inside <table>, if it's the first element
16:23  Ungy: table.passform tbody tr:first-child
16:23  ZombieLoffe: Carmageddon: Might wanna do tbody tr:first-child {} if it's inside a tbody
16:24  Carmageddon: <tr><td align="center" colspan="2">change pass</td></tr> << is the part I want to catch, but its deep inside nested tbody/table stuff generated by .net

16:25  Ungy: Carmageddon: well figure out the output and put it accordingly
16:25  Kingsy: if I have an <li><a href="#"><span>Link</span></a></li>   how can I set the color of the text in the span using li { color:#FFFFFF; } ? if you do that you need to somehow set li a { color:none; }   does that make sense?
16:26  Kingsy: its a dodgy one because the a defaults to a blue color for a link.. the only way I know of getting rid of that is li a {color:#FFFFFF;} but what happens if you wanted to set the color from the li? not the a ?
16:26  Carmageddon: Ungy: is there any tool to help me build a css selector for the element I point to? something like firebug showing where you point
16:26  ZombieLoffe: Kingsy: Uhhh. _You_ make no sense. Just set li a { color: #fff; } ?
16:27 --- anos is now known as eternicode
16:27  ZombieLoffe: Kingsy: By default the browser applies color: blue; to <a>s -- that will override the inherit color from the <li>.
16:27  Ungy: Carmageddon: why not use firebug?
16:27  Kingsy: ZombieLoffe - yea in this case I cant set the color with the a because its for a menyu
16:27  ZombieLoffe: Kingsy: ... so?
16:28  Carmageddon: Ungy: firebug has such function?
16:28  Kingsy: ZombieLoffe - so its going in a li:hover , if I put it in the a:hover then the color would change back as soon as the user put their mouse onto the menu below the <a>
16:28  Ugot2BkidNme: Kingsy li a span{ color:#fff; }
16:28  ZombieLoffe: Kingsy: So set li:hover a {}
16:29  Kingsy: ZombieLoffe - ffs, why didnt I think of that? crap
16:30  Kingsy: thanks man, sorry about that, I appriciate it
16:30  ZombieLoffe: Sure, np
16:30  Ugot2BkidNme: li:hover no work in IE6
16:30  Kafetist: abandon ie6
16:30  Kafetist: let it rot
16:30  Ugot2BkidNme: wish I could wish I could
16:30  Kafetist: heh ;)
16:31  Kafetist: I'm definately glad I can.
16:31  Ugot2BkidNme: I used to love IE6 back in 2001 you know it was the best
16:31  Kafetist: lol no, sorry dude..
16:31  Ugot2BkidNme: but became old and outdated about 2004
16:31  Kafetist: I've been using intarnets from 97 and I didn't use IE back then
16:32  Bananobot: IE 6 was decent back in 2001
16:32  Bananobot: But IE 6 was still the latest version of IE after 5 years
16:32  Kafetist: I went for nutscrape navigator
16:32  Ugot2BkidNme: was the most compliant in 2001 well except for Opera but noone used that :-)
16:32  Lazylegs: I used Mozilla all those years :)
16:32  Bananobot: Opera needs a complete chrome rewrite, IMO
16:33  Lazylegs: before mozilla netscape :)
16:33  Bananobot: Opera needs to be made to feel more native
16:33  Bananobot: The patches they've been making aren't enough
16:33  Kafetist: oh man I like opera UI
16:33  Kafetist: but chrome takes less space
16:33  Neillithan: today I learned that you can prevent the clear:both from clearing floated preceding floated elements by simply using display:table
16:33  Bananobot: Using Opera feels like using some Java app.
16:33  Bananobot: It just doesn't feel right
16:33  Kafetist: that's the feel I get when I use firefox tho
16:34  Kafetist: so I guess I can relate
16:34  Bananobot: Firefox at least looks and feels like a native GTK app.
16:34  Kafetist: but it's about what you've been offered before..
16:34  Ugot2BkidNme: I have been trying IE9 so far so good I am impressed MS has made giant leaps and bounds with compliancy
16:34  Kafetist: Firefox has always felt clumsy for me
16:34  Bananobot: IE 8 was leaps and bounds better than IE 7 in terms of CSS support
16:34  Bananobot: IE 7 was... a modest improvement over IE 6
16:35  Ugot2BkidNme: Used to love Firefox until the plug-in creators went overboard and damn the memory leak man
16:35  Kafetist: well about time they started doing that, Ugot2BkidNme, as they've been plummeting down on browser stats from 2002 now and they're still going down fast.
16:35  Bananobot: IE 7 just picked some of the low-hanging fruit (width/height properties, selectors...)
16:35  GaiusOctavius: I want to define a background image which is 1px high and 2000px wide which get's centered in the background, but:
16:35  GaiusOctavius: background-image: url("../../tl_files/studio_q/background.gif");
16:35  GaiusOctavius: background-repeat: repeat-y;
16:35  GaiusOctavius: doesn't center it right :-/
16:35  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananbot but those things were a huge improvement for layout
16:35  Bananobot: I haven't had memory issues with Firefox since like Firefox 3
16:35  GaiusOctavius: what am I doing wrong?
16:36  ZombieLoffe: GaiusOctavius: background-position: center center;
16:36  Bananobot: Ugot2BkidNme: Right, they made a lot of difference in real-world situations, but they were low-hanging fruit.
16:36  Bananobot: Ugot2BkidNme: Not that much was actually changed
16:36  ZombieLoffe: GaiusOctavius: Or just use the shorthand background, eg background: url('bg.gif') repeat-y center; }
16:36  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananobot: true but better then nothing
16:36  GaiusOctavius: ZombieLoffe: I did, but it didn't
16:36  GaiusOctavius: center
16:37  Kafetist: it's the mistakes of the past that haunt MS for long time tho.. and then again, I don't really care even if they managed to make so crappy browser all the PC vendors installed different ones as default. firefox is now the most used browser, maybe it even comes as a default browser for some PC manufacturer
16:37  GaiusOctavius: ZombieLoffe: oh shit, forget it. The designer gave me the wrong images :-/
16:37  ZombieLoffe: Damn designers.
16:37  Bananobot: There's speculation that IE 8 will be the next IE 6, since IE 9 won't be available on XP. I'm not sure it's quite that bad, since the statistics I've seen put XP at below 40% now and declining
16:38  Ugot2BkidNme: Katetist actually IE8 is number 1 followed by IE6 (damned corporate users)
16:38  Ugot2BkidNme: IE8 is on XP?
16:38  Bananobot: Yeah
16:38  Ugot2BkidNme: ahh shit guess I shoudl update the laptop
16:38  Kafetist: Ugot2BkidNme: oh rly? where do you get that?
16:38  Bananobot: It requires either SP 2 or SP 3 (I don't remember which)
16:38  Ugot2BkidNme: Sweet thanks Bananobot
16:39  Kafetist: Ugot2BkidNme: I'm not saying my source is reliable, in fact it's w3schools so it might be dead wrong, but they state overall IE use is below 30%..
16:39  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: latest report i read from webtrends
16:39  Bananobot: w3schools is NOT reliable
16:39  Bananobot: Their statistics only counts visitors to w3schools
16:39  Kafetist: rly :D
16:39  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: that is only for their site
16:39  Bananobot: It's WAY incorrect
16:39  Ugot2BkidNme: most developers do not use IE6
16:39  Kafetist: haha, how lame.
16:39  Bananobot: Use Net Applications or StatCounter
16:39  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: but they also state that in there numbers
16:39  Bananobot: Net Applications puts most of their statistics behind a paywall
16:40  Bananobot: StatCounter is free
16:40  Ugot2BkidNme: Firefox is number 1 browser in Europe though
16:40  Ugot2BkidNme: barely beating out IE8
16:41  Bananobot: StatCounter puts IE 8 at 29.65% worldwide, Firefox 3.6 is 26.64%, IE 7 is 12.44%, Chrome 6 is 8.29%, IE 6 is 6.86%..
16:41  Ugot2BkidNme: IE6 though is still the most used corporate browser on the planet and makes certain industries a pain in the but
16:41  Neillithan: Can somebody tell me why this displays differently in webkit than firefox/opera? http://jsfiddle.net/fM8qf/5/
16:41  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananobot: oh interesting stats never use that site before
16:42  john2x: hi. how do I position elements to be centered in the browser?
16:42  Ugot2BkidNme: I just get Omniture results for the sites I work on IE8 then IE6 followed drastically by Firefox then Chrome then Safari which to me is the only thing that really matters since it shoudl depend on yoru site not on overall stats unless you are uilding a new site for new audience
16:43  Bananobot: Net Applications uses a different weight system, so their statistics are somewhat different. Basically, they look at what percentage of their data comes from a given country versus what the actual Internet population of that country is considered to be, and they adjust their weights to compensate for their regional bias.
16:43  Ugot2BkidNme: john2x you mean like center height and width?
16:43  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananobot: good to know
16:43  Bananobot: I don't think StatCounter does that
16:43  Ugot2BkidNme: Thanks for the information
16:43  Bananobot: So StatCounter is likely biased in toward Western countries
16:44  Kafetist: I'm just curious why would they do that :D
16:44  Bananobot: The most significant different would probably be China, which would be weighted more heavily in Net Applications' global stats than in StatCounter
16:44  Bananobot: *difference
16:44  Kafetist: Sounds like a stupid weighting to me.
16:45  john2x: Ugot2BkidNme: i have 2 divs, combined they are 960px wide. The left side is 640px and the other is 320px. I want the two of them side by side, centered.
16:45  Neillithan: anybody at all?
16:46  Ugot2BkidNme: john2x: bady { width:960px; margin:0 auto; }
16:46  Ugot2BkidNme: I meant body not bady duh
16:47  Bananobot: Kafetist: These companies can only gather statistics from websites that install their products. Net Applications knows that their customers tend to be more concentrated in some countries than in others (Net Applications might not have many customers serving Chinese audiences). So, when they notice that China is underrepresented in their data, they know what to adjust to make the distribution more accurate.
16:47  john2x: Ugot2BkidNme: super thanks!
16:47  Bananobot: Kafetist: So it's less about the distribution of their product and more about the distribution of Internet users.
16:48  Kafetist: yeah I guess that's good
16:48  Kafetist: and also maybe the data would also count in towards users that have shared IP etc.
16:48  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: but overall it really matters what your website/sites you are looking at use
16:49  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: not really you can determine a unique signature very easily
16:49  Kafetist: offtopic, anyone of you's got a javascript/flash videoplayer to recommend?
16:50  Kafetist: Ugot2BkidNme: oh, it seems I'm very little into web statistics :D
16:50  Ugot2BkidNme: Kafetist: well as long as your users are not complaining then you should be good
16:51  MuKatroNi: hello
16:51  MuKatroNi: :)
16:51  Ugot2BkidNme: hey ZombieLoffe I was wondering instead of first child woudl table > tr work?
16:51  Bananobot: Web analytics has inherent limitations. There's just no way to truly accurately measure the usage of web browsers. For starters, it's essentially a poll that depends on web browsers being honest. Then, it has to use various heuristics to try to tell different users apart. Each of these assumptions introduces inaccuracies, but there's no way around that.
16:52  drubies: assuming web browsers aren't being honest introduces a theoretical inaccuracy
16:52  GarethAdams|Work: Statistics can certainly be useful
16:53  drubies: most target demographics do not include hackers, bots, and... dishonest browsers
16:53  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananobot: depending on how you figure data you can make it more accurate as user-agent does not necessarily make it correct. However, if you have a large enough sample size you can presume your pretty accurate
16:53  GarethAdams|Work: but only when you compare what you collected at one point in time with what you collected at another point in time
16:53  MuKatroNi: i need help building a toolbar ,because im a designer not so much coder.. can anyone give me a hand maybe? thanks
16:53  MuKatroNi: this is the idea i have http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/6990/firegb.jpg
16:53  GarethAdams|Work: don't think of them as absolute figures, but as relative figures compared to information collected the same way at a different point
16:53  MuKatroNi: :D
16:54  Ugot2BkidNme: MuKatroNi: wow really Pink?
16:54  MuKatroNi: no its a test
16:54  MuKatroNi: hehe
16:55  MuKatroNi: i want to make a toolbar like that
16:55  Bananobot: The exact data sources are possibly the biggest weakness of existing web analytics companies. They can only get data from sites that install their software. If your software is non-free or otherwise targets large companies, your data sources are probably going to be biased toward e-commerce sites or other sites that are focused on revenue. This may not necessarily be representative of the "average" website.
16:56  Bananobot: This is why I wish Google Analytics would publish their global summary statistics.
16:56  Bananobot: Google Analytics is probably about as fairly distributed as they get
16:57  Ugot2BkidNme: Mukatroni well make a div at the correct height put inside the div your logo absolute position it left make a ul with an li for each of yoru menu's putting sub ul's inside for any drop down's float the firt ul right and have the li's below float left inside of it set a width of the top ul and ptu a display none on the ul ul then on hover of the selection make the ul ul display block
16:57  Bananobot: But apparently Google's mission isn't to organize the world's information and make it universally available and useful.
16:57  Bananobot: s/available/accessible/
16:57  MuKatroNi: wow let me diggest that Ugot2BkidNme
16:57  MuKatroNi: thanks
16:59  Ugot2BkidNme: Bananobot: you forgot to add the truly useful information is of course for a fee
17:00  Ugot2BkidNme: Mukatroni your also goign to need to use javascript ot make your hide show
17:01  MuKatroNi: and the tooltip
17:01  MuKatroNi: right?
17:01  Ugot2BkidNme: well if you want it to be that color yes otherwise you can just use title on it if you want a generic tootip
17:02  Shwaiil: Q: Having a main container, and a nested iframe, can we have iframe set to height auto and main div auto ? I'm now going to try float left, because its not working properly
17:02  Shwaiil: Thanks for looking any tip is appreciated!
17:02  Ugot2BkidNme: Shwaiil: not very descriptive what are you trying to do exactly?
17:03  Shwaiil: Ugot2BkidNme, well, have a main container, for the iframe!
17:04  Ugot2BkidNme: Swaiil ox you have an iframe inside of your div and.....
17:05  Shwaiil: The content on iframe, varies. Thats why I would like to have auto in both
17:05  Shwaiil: But thanks anyway, I'll stick with js
17:06  Ugot2BkidNme: Shwaiil: so you want the content of your iframe to set the size of your div?
17:07  Shwaiil: Yeah, like it would if the iframe was a inline block with some data
17:08  john2x: hmm.. if I specify the width of a div, and apply padding, it seems to increase its width. How do I specify padding to 'go inward'?
17:09  Ugot2BkidNme: Shwaiil interesting I like to use javascript and just show the content of the fram into the div but that is just me
17:10  Shwaiil: Ugot2BkidNme, you'd better stick with mootools or jquery
17:10  Ugot2BkidNme: john2x well your thinking IE6 and I agree with you that is how I think it shoudl be done but it is not the box model is actually this
17:10  Shwaiil: but yes, its possible =)
17:10  Shwaiil: you've got plenty of scripts and tuts that explain that
17:11  Ugot2BkidNme: width is = padding-left + content + padding-right
17:11  Shwaiil: they mainly use it, for forms that upload files, customized
17:11  Ugot2BkidNme: I don't remember off hand if border is included in width though
17:11  Ugot2BkidNme: Shwaiil: oh I know how to do it
17:11  Ugot2BkidNme: it is very easy
17:12  Ugot2BkidNme: John2x so essentially you just need to subtract the padding fromt eh width
17:16  john2x: Ugot2BkidNme: ah thanks again!
17:25  MuKatroNi: someone wants a design?
17:25  MuKatroNi: and you make me a little css?
17:25  MuKatroNi: hehe im crazy right
17:26  MuKatroNi: can anyone help me calculate the price of making this toolbar? http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/6990/firegb.jpg
