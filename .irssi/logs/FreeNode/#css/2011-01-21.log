19:17  mod_cure: how can i make it, so when i click on a link it will not out an underline on it
19:19  riven: mod_cure: out? "add"?
19:19  Vaerros: put, methinks
19:19  riven: ah "put" I guess
19:19  riven: `css text-decoration @ mod_cure
19:19  rivvles: mod_cure, CSS 'text-decoration' property: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-decoration
19:19  riven: `css :active
19:19  rivvles: CSS ':active' pseudo-class: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#the-user-action-pseudo-classes-hover-act
19:19  mod_cure: i dont want the underline when the link is clicked
19:20  Vaerros: wasn't someone asking about how to highlight 'current page anchors?'
19:20  freedrull: is making a container position:relative; and its children position:absolute; the proper way to align elements inside the edges of a container div?
19:20  mod_cure: .heading a:hover, .heading a:active, .heading a:focus {
19:20  mod_cure:   text-decoration:underline;
19:20  mod_cure: }   but when i click on the link, the underline stays there for some reason
19:21  riven: ..
19:21  riven: s/underline/none/ ?
19:23  freedrull: so what happens if a container is position:absolute; and its children are position:relative;?
19:26  riven: freedrull: same thing that would happen if this parent didn't have abspos.

19:43  nitrospectide: If I am using @font-face, how do i get things that are bolded in css to pick up the bold version of the embedded face?
19:44  hhaidar: nitrospectide: You'd need to get a bold version of the font.
19:46  nitrospectide: hhaidar: right, but normally, if i set the p tag to be say, Verdana... wrapping some words within a p in <strong> automatically makes use of Verdana Bold. If i set my p to an @font-face font like Ubuntu, now when I wrap something in <strong>, it doesn;t seem to intelligently find Ubuntu bold
19:47  nitrospectide: this assumes I have embedded it the same as the roman face
19:48  hhaidar: nitrospectide: Some fonts have seperate files for bold/italic/etc..
19:48  hhaidar: nitrospectide: What font are you embeding?
19:49  nitrospectide: hhaidar: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TitilliumText
19:49  nitrospectide: my tag sets the face like so: font-family: 'TitilliumText22LRegular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
19:50  hhaidar: nitrospectide: Well, there's like 6 files.
19:50  hhaidar: nitrospectide: Each file is a different weight.
19:51  hhaidar: nitrospectide: You'd need to get a font editing tool to repackage the otf.
19:51  nitrospectide: hhaidar: right. i get that. my question is, if <p> is font-family: 'TitilliumText22LRegular', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ... then how do i get <p><strong> text to be font-family: 'TitilliumText22LBold', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
19:51  nitrospectide: i was responding to your prev post
19:51  nitrospectide: about each being a diff weight
19:53  hhaidar: nitrospectide: I don't understand. If you're using <strong>, you shouldn't see a different in your font since the otf file is just 1 weight.
19:55  Lacrymology: is there a reference on what is considered more specific than what?
19:57  hhaidar: Lacrymology: http://www.webteacher.ws/2008/05/19/tip-calculate-the-specificity-of-css-selectors/
19:57  noxxy: anyone know how to make a link "pulse" on hover using css3? I'm thinking animation, but not really sure.
19:58  Lacrymology: I'm having a problem with this multiselect here: http://wordpress.tomasneme.com.ar/beta/static/test.html
19:58  Lacrymology: hhaidar: thanks
19:59  hhaidar: noxxy: That's done by jquery: https://github.com/jamespadolsey/jQuery-Plugins/tree/master/pulse/
19:59  noxxy: hhaidar: Yeah, I knew I could use jquery lol. I just thought css3 would have some way to make something pulsate. :p
20:00  nitrospectide: hhaidar: Arial, Arial Bold, Arial Italic, Arial bold Italic are all separate font files. But they live here on the local machine. Are you saying that if embedding and wanting things like <strong> to work, the different weights in a font have to be mashed somehow into a single otf file?
20:01  hhaidar: noxxy: I think webkit might have something fancy, but I don't think CSS in general has something like this.
20:02  noxxy: hhaidar: thats what I thought too. Couldn't hurt to double check lol.
20:02  Lacrymology: that's kinda stupid, that id wins over all else. Well, at least it's stupid that that #id attribute is inherited down the DOM tree.. how does one override a rule written on one's container by ID? adding an extra ID, I guess, but what if that doesn't make sense for the design (I want all multiselects to act like that)
20:02  noxxy: Lacrymology: learn the specifity rules lol.
20:03  noxxy: Lacrymology: css is built on a point system basically, you wouldn't need to add another id to make it more important, just another class or general element. :p
20:05  Lacrymology: noxxy: I'm reading the, what I'm saying is this.. specific example: wordpress wraps everything in a div with #wpcontent right? and in it's standard css does #wpcontent select { height: 2em; }
20:06  Lacrymology: now everything that's under wpcontent gets matched over a #wpcontent rule, unless it has a more specific ID
20:06  MauriceJ: smop: Brill, mate, thanks for keeping me up to date.
20:07  Lacrymology: so I need to add #wpcontent to every rule I want to override, which is kind of stupid
20:08  Lacrymology: that's all I'm saying
20:08  Lacrymology: I don't know who's doing it wrong. Possibly the wordpress people
20:08  Lacrymology: probably me
20:13  diamonds: Lacrymology: depends on your approach.  is there a reason you are overriding the rule rather than changing the rule itself?
20:14  Lacrymology: diamonds: because the rules is defined by wordpress and changing it would get undone in the next upgrade? and shouldn't be done?
20:14  diamonds: Lacrymology: styles are in the core?
20:15  Lacrymology: diamonds: in the themes, I think
20:15  diamonds: Lacrymology: yes, you keep your own themes
20:15  diamonds: the theme is yours to do with what you want
20:16  Lacrymology: I guess
20:19  diamonds: but it sounds like you want to be able to upgrade the theme?
20:32  nitrospectide: hhaidar: here's a simple test example of what I meant: http://dev.hexatrope.com/font-face/
20:39  nitrospectide: can anyone tell me how to get the <strong> tag to automatically use the bold version of the embedded font - as shown in my link above?
20:39  diamonds: nitrospectide: strong{font-family:'your-font-bold-variant'} ?
20:40  nitrospectide: diamonds: well, i know i could do that, but then i have to explicitly state it any time i'm doing this in different places. I was hoping there was a way to get <strong> to just pick up the bold variant the way it does for non-embedded fonts like arial
20:41  diamonds: nitrospectide: no
20:41  diamonds: that is the css way ^^
20:41  diamonds: nitrospectide: anyway just make a sitewide style on strong
20:42  nitrospectide: diamonds: but it wouldn't be that simple. i'd have to make a new strong for each place i define a font change
20:43  diamonds: ?
20:43  diamonds: you want the browser to just "automatically" know which font-face to use without telling it?
20:43  nitrospectide: so if a sidebar is another face, that needs its own strong css, if embedded code is, that needs it's own
20:44  diamonds: .sidebar strong{font-family:'other-bold-variant'}
20:44  diamonds: dude idk what to tell you :p
20:44  diamonds: you have to specify the font you want the browser to use
20:45  marcamilly: anyone have a work-around for this issue in FF ?
20:45  marcamilly: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4756049/why-does-border-5px-dashed-not-come-out-as-dashed-in-firefox
20:47  nitrospectide: diamonds: if i define p as arial, #sidebar p as georgia, code as courier.... i just put a <strong> inside any of those and it automatically picks up the bold weight. now you're saying that with embedded fonts, I'd have to do p Ubuntu... p strong Ubunto Bold, #sidebar p Titillium... #sidebar p strong Titillium Bold... etc?
20:47  nitrospectide: that seems kludgy
20:47  diamonds: nitrospectide: you are not changing the WEIGHT you are changing the font
20:48  diamonds: if you want it to be bold add font-weight:900 or bold or whatver
20:48  diamonds: if you want a special font, specify what font
20:48  diamonds: the browser does bold, what you want is a different font
20:49  smop: god
20:49  smop: the validator
20:49  smop: is so fucking awesome
20:50  riven: diamonds: if the browser does bold, it's faux bold, and far from ideal :)
20:51  diamonds: riven: true.
20:51  diamonds: I'm attempting to explain why it doesn't do what nitrospectide would like
20:51  diamonds: you know more about this tho so please correct/add to anything I've said
20:52  nitrospectide: diamonds: but when I use a local font like Georgia - one that is installed on the machine (a standard web font), it is my understanding that <strong> actually uses the Georgia bold font, not a crappy pseudo bold done in the browser
20:53  MauriceJ: riven! :D
20:53 * MauriceJ shakes in fear
20:53  diamonds: nitrospectide: fair enough. Ask riven. :)
20:53  nitrospectide: riven: please do add your input.
20:55  user_corrupt: hello all
20:56  riven: nitrospectide: @font-face selects a font, not a family.
20:57  riven: In short, CSS' font system is a total mess. :)
20:57  nitrospectide: riven: so there is no way it be a family and have things like <strong> auto pick up the proper face?
20:58  riven: No.
20:58  user_corrupt: I have a div for a menu that Im working on on this page, and the individual images contained within it are appearing one on top of another...how do I make them appear one after another, horizontally? www.yourprintshop.com
20:58  nitrospectide: what is the font-weight attribute in the @font-face tag?
20:58  Vaerros: user_corrupt, site's broken
20:58  diamonds: user_corrupt: your link doesn't seem to work
20:58  Vaerros: anyway, display: inline-block
20:58  Vaerros: basically
20:59  riven: nitrospectide: a descriptor that tells the browser that it's a "bold" font.
20:59  Vaerros: on second thought, sounds like something else is going on--images directly inside a div, right?
20:59  user_corrupt: oops
20:59  user_corrupt: http://www.yourprinthouse.com/
20:59  user_corrupt: duh
21:00  nitrospectide: riven: for what purpose? jQuery targeting or screenreaders?
21:00  Vaerros: style.css ~ line 27 gives them display: block
21:00  riven: `search font-face
21:00  riven: meh
21:00  riven: nitrospectide: read up here: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#the-font-face-rule
21:01  user_corrupt: Vaerros: inline-block, thanks man
21:01  nitrospectide: riven: thx
21:01  nitrospectide: and you're right.. this is screwed up
21:07  mod_cure: when i move my mouse over over text, i want to have an underline show up under the text. how can i do this ?
21:08  diamonds: mod_cure: .yourclass:hover{text-decoration:underline;}
21:09  Muty: hi guys.. one question. I want to remove the top margin of the body / html element. I remember the solution was html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0}. But this doesn't work in Chrome, Safari, Firefox
21:09  Muty: Any ideas?
21:10  Cork[home]: that should work
21:10  riven: Sure that works. If it doesn't do what you expect it to, the margin comes from somewhere else.
21:13  Muty: div's don't have padding / margin right? so maybe the h1 (block?) in the header-div?
21:13  Muty: ok it was the h1. Sorry.
21:17  Spreadsheet: Is there a way to set a setting for all headers h1-h6?
21:18  systemfault: h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { lulz: roflmao; }
21:20  Spreadsheet: Thanks
21:23  tempesta: are there any compatibility problems with @import url() statement?
21:24  daviddoria: when I float an image, the vertical-align property appears not to work anymore: http://daviddoria.com/HTMLExamples/TextBesideImage/TextBesideImageFloat.html - what I am trying to do is just have the text and image vertically centered, but with the image floating so if the text wraps it will stay to the right of the image instead of going under it
21:26  tempesta: my problem is i have several collections on the site and each collection has articles looking differently. so, instead of keeping several copies of the style sheet, i'd like to keep on "main.css" and include a few bits to overrride the styles for other collections. Is is the way to go?
21:27  tempesta: right now, each collection has its own style sheet. So, what I want to do is to import main.css and then use the collection specific css to override some styles
21:28  tempesta: is this the right approach?

21:48  nitrospectide: riven: diamonds: I got it working the way I was talking about: http://dev.hexatrope.com/font-face/
21:49  speak: welcome back riven!
21:49  nitrospectide: This blog post was the precise answer I needed - even outlined the kludginess of the other solution nicely: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201012/font-face_tip_define_font-weight_and_font-style_to_keep_your_css_simple/
21:49  MauriceJ: :D
21:51  Itrace: What does this mean for the line-height: "...   font:13px/1.231 arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif;   ..."  Is it 1.231 em or px or pt or what?
21:51  diamonds: nitrospectide: awesome!
21:51  diamonds: I didn't know that.
21:52  nitrospectide: diamonds: well, that's why i took the time of redoing my example and giving you that and the blog post. I appreciate your time. I thought you'd benefit from this.
21:53  diamonds: I did, thank you for sharing.  Good on you for not listening to riven and I :)
21:53  diamonds: *me
21:54  nitrospectide: on a completely different front - what are the most popular/flexible ways for sizing type on the web? is the 62.5% method considered obsolete?
21:54  nitrospectide: I tend to use pixels, but last I knew, some browsers wouldn;t resize that
21:58  ravenzz: em
21:58  nitrospectide: ravenzz: don't ems compound as you go further into child elements? or is that some other measurement that does that, like %?
21:59  systemfault: ems is relative.
21:59  tempesta: nitrospectide, do not use pixels, use em because em is relative to the vertical font size whatever your screen resolution is. pix may look very small on high resolution screens
22:03  nitrospectide: tempesta: interesting point. hadn't considered that
22:05  nitrospectide: is this update on 62.5% what you guys use? http://www.alistapart.com/articles/howtosizetextincss/

22:21  JoeNeedsHelp: Quick question,  let's say you have an element floated right with a margin-left and other element has an overflow hidden which shows up on the left side of it, could you float another element to the right above the previous 2?
22:21  JoeNeedsHelp: Or would you need to put a container div around the other 2 before doing that?
22:29  qq99: I've got a display:inline with a margin-bottom, but the stuff below it collapses into its margin.  effectively, its margin does nothing, is there a fix?
22:32  riven: qq99: no. Use something other than inline.
22:33  qq99: riven, aside from float and inline, is there some box that expands only to the size of the text contents inside?
22:34  riven: abspos, d:inline-block, d:table, d:table-cell
22:34  qq99: riven, thanks, guess I'm screwed re: ie lol
22:35  riven: no you're not
22:35  qq99: will read up more on margin collapse to try to remedy this
22:35  riven: d:inline-block works in IE, and you probably don't even need it
22:35  qq99: IE7+? never knew
22:35  riven: qq99: this isn't margin collapsing.
22:35  riven: ie5.5+
22:35  riven: vertical margins on d:inline elements just doesn't work like you'd expect.
22:36  qq99: ohhh I see

22:36  Drule: Look at how a horizontal scrollbad appears
22:36  Drule: Isn't that weird as hell?
22:36  Drule: scrollbar*
22:36  riven: Drule: yes, and that will change in the future
22:36  Drule: What's the cause of this?
22:36  riven: nothing you can do about that right now, though
22:36  Drule: I couldn't find anything on Google.
22:37  riven: Drule: the spec used to prescribe that behaviour. Changed now, but will have to wait for implementations to catch up.
22:37  Drule: are there fixes yet?
22:51  hagus: if the parameters for <p> are not explicitly stated as related to p in a stylesheet, where might the text be getting its spacing from?
22:54  hagus: Basically, I have downloaded a free html5 css3 template.  I am using it to wrap around some ruby output.  However, although I can vary the parameters for <ol><ul>, headers, etc.,  I cannot find how to set paragraph style.
22:55  hagus: The default style is OK but I want to be able to play about with it.

23:35  daviddoria: can you vertically center text on a floated image?
23:36  dravekx: daviddoria, http://htmlcsstutorials.blogspot.com/2009/07/vertical-align-text-in-floating-div.html
23:37  daviddoria: that is for when the text is IN the float right? I have this: http://daviddoria.com/HTMLExamples/TextBesideImage/TextBesideImageFloat.html
23:38  dravekx: ew
23:39  daviddoria: ew? haha
23:39  dravekx: daviddoria, use the image as a background in the div, then use the bove link. screw that img tag.
23:40  daviddoria: I didn't know img tags were bad?
23:41  daviddoria: dravekx, if the image is the background of the div, then wont the text appear on top of it instead of next to it?
23:41  dravekx: ugh.
23:41  dravekx: ok
23:41  dravekx: you're right. good luck.
23:42  smop: have fun.
23:42  daviddoria: wow, I'm just trying to understand - no need to bite my head off
23:43  dravekx: he said "Hey, slow it down whataya want from me" lol
23:43  riven: daviddoria: img { vertical-align: middle }
23:44  daviddoria: riven: i have that on the img tag
23:44  daviddoria: and it worked fine
23:44  daviddoria: until I floated the image
23:44  riven: oh, floated.
23:44  dravekx: yeah
23:44  riven: um, why float it?
23:45  daviddoria: otherwise this seems to happen: http://rpi.edu/~doriad/ - see the logo on the left
23:45  daviddoria: the text is vertically aligned until it wraps
23:45  daviddoria: which is what I thought a float is used for?
23:46  riven: Right. Well, you're out of luck, then. Happy hacking!
23:46  riven: `vertical center
23:46  rivvles: riven, no such command `vertical center`. Try `search <query> to search for commands.

23:54  daviddoria: This is exactly what I thought would happen: http://daviddoria.com/HTMLExamples/TextBesideImage/TextBesideImageFloat.html
23:54  daviddoria: the text is just on top of the image
23:57  dravekx: daviddoria ?
23:57  dravekx: so you want the text on the right and centered on the image floated by itself?

23:58  daviddoria: I think so
23:58  daviddoria: I'm happy to do it another way if you suggest
