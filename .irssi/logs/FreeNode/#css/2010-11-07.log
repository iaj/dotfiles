21:09  [eXception]: hi
21:10  [eXception]: what position-type should the elements have inside of a position:absolute-div, wich is inside of a position:relative-div
21:10  [eXception]: ?
21:10  [eXception]: its like this:  <p:relative><p:absolute><ul,li (left floated)></p></p>
21:12 --- Hutch[S] is now known as Hutch[S]|away
21:14  ZombieLoffe: [eXception]: First of all, <p> cannot have block-level children, so <p><ul></ul></p> is invalid
21:14  ZombieLoffe: [eXception]: and second, you don't need to set any particular position to children of pos: abs; elements, the default (static) works fine
21:15  eighty4: ZombieLoffe: third, should you every have nested <p>s?
21:15  [eXception]: sry... I meant P=position
21:15  [eXception]: its div of course
21:15  ZombieLoffe: oh, right.
21:15  ZombieLoffe: eighty4: "Cannot have block-level children" covers that, since <p> is block :)
21:16  eighty4: ZombieLoffe: well, yeah...
21:16  steveym: top navigation got all screwed up pretty much overnight I didn't make any changes, any ideas what could have happened? url is spiritpharma.com

21:35  steveym: The font element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.
21:35  steveym: guess my html for dummies is no longer valid
21:35  b1lly: i'm having trouble vertically aligning my text in the middle of an element
21:36  somasin: steveym: it appear simply adding 2 more <li> to the <ul> inside <div id="navitop"> was enoungh to break the nav

21:43  somasin: disappearedng: consider using display:inline-block instead of float
21:45  b1lly: somasin: I still cant figure it out
21:47  newbee: Can someone tell me how to get my content to the top on www.obruhn.dk

22:36  p3lim: boogyman: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01w
22:36  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz1: Because you have some funky CSS applied to it, most likely.

22:38  razieliyo: so, pointer, ok
22:38 --- jigz is now known as jrockjiggz
22:38  boogyman: Chubbz1: <hr> is a presentational element and should be represented instead by using a border
22:39 --- Chubbz1 is now known as Chubbz-School
22:40  Chubbz-School: boogyman: wait, what?
22:40  ZombieLoffe: boogyman is correct.
22:40  boogyman: no im' not
22:40  ZombieLoffe: Okay, he's a filthy liar.
22:41  Chubbz-School: Ok... i was getting a little confused
22:41  boogyman: ZombieLoffe: please reference a semantic use for <hr>
22:41  ZombieLoffe: I agreed with you, lawl
22:41  riven: boogyman: HTML5 has some
22:41 --- squiggy_ is now known as squiggy
22:41  ZombieLoffe: In HTML5 it's a semantic element again, though
22:41  Chubbz-School: But seriously, no "funky" css applied to my HR, but its not showing up in FF
22:41  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz-School: Most likely you shouldn't be using a <hr> in the first place.
22:41  riven: basically, menu division or thematic break in paragraph
22:42  somasin: disappearedng: put vertical-align:middle on all of the inline elements (ie the second inline-block div as well)
22:42  Chubbz-School: Educate me, why should I not use HR?
22:42  boogyman: p3lim: thank you for the testcase... now what are you trying to center, and are you trying to center horizontally, or vertically?
22:42  riven: We just told you, brah.
22:42  Chubbz-School: other than it no being able to display?
22:42  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz-School, because it's presentational, in html4
22:42  riven: Pay attention
22:42  disappearedng: wow that did it
22:42  disappearedng: somasin: thx, but may I know what the problem is? 
22:42  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz-School, presentational HTML == bad. Stuff like <b>, <font>, <i> (in html4, of course)... they're presentational
22:43  boogyman: riven: testcase?
22:43  riven: ?
22:43  Chubbz-School: any suggestions as to what to replace it with?
22:43  p3lim: boogyman: I'm trying to place #about with an offset to the right (horizontal) from the center
22:43  riven: For what purpose is it being used, Chubbz-School?
22:43  ZombieLoffe: boogyman,  http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element
22:44  boogyman: <b><i><hr> are presentational elements... regardless of what the HTML5 specification states
22:44  ZombieLoffe: Eh.. "regardless of the spec"? What?
22:44  Chubbz-School: riven: as a separator between my main page and my fotoer
22:44 --- Azure|dc2 is now known as Azure
22:44  Chubbz-School: *footer
22:44  somasin: disappearedng: I'd explain it better if I could.
22:44  ZombieLoffe: boogyman, they used to be presentational, now they have semantic meaning
22:45  riven: Chubbz-School: visual separator?
22:45  Chubbz-School: riven: yup
22:45  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz-School: CSS borders to the rescue
22:46  Chubbz-School: ZombieLoffe: right, but I'm gonna have to put a div there, because I dont want the HR going all the way across
22:46  ZombieLoffe: Chubbz-School, so be it
22:46  boogyman: ZombieLoffe: please define "stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance"
22:47  ZombieLoffe: generic elements (like div) are better than presentational one
22:47  boogyman: PS, this is #html discussion :-s
22:47  ZombieLoffe: boogyman, I find it vague too, and I don't like it... but the spec defines it.
22:47  ZombieLoffe: true
22:47  Aleoss: boogyman, don't refer to #html. That channel is bullshit. #web is more effective.
22:48  ZombieLoffe: haters gonna hate
22:48  Aleoss: Referring to #html is like referring to W3Schools.
22:50  ZombieLoffe: Aleoss, what, did you go in there saying "Tables for layout rock!"? :)
22:52  boogyman: Aleoss: just because #css is a lot more lenient in "OT" doesn't mean that #html is equivalent to w3schools

23:04  Aleoss: boogyman: No, it is a matter of that #html is ran by Visage who doesn't know his ass from his face the amount he spews out bullshit. Half the things he says are "JS" when it can be easily accomplished in HTML and/or CSS with some server-side support.
23:04  Aleoss: And he bulls out the ban stick every time someone corrects him.
23:04  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: it positions to the left, don't you mean margin-right or something?
23:05  ZombieLoffe: p3lim: Uh.. no?
23:05  Aleoss: pulls*
23:05  ZombieLoffe: Aleoss: That's just plain not true :)
23:05 --- Channel #css was synced in 129 seconds
23:05  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: because margin-left doesnt do shit, im testing on webdevout
23:06  ZombieLoffe: I've been lurking #html for more than a year, I've seen Visage ban someone 3 or 4 times, and each time it was more than deserved
23:06  Aleoss: ZombieLoffe: Oh it's true, I've seen it happen several times before I myself got banned.
23:06  boogyman: Aleoss: in the year i've been following that channel, I've not seen him +b anyone... He does reference just about every other IRC channel, but most of the time it's appropriate
23:06  Aleoss: I've seen him ban 5 people in the 2 months I spent there. Where were you ZombieLoffe?
23:07  boogyman: Aleoss: ahh, now the reason emerges... what did you do directly prior to being +b
23:07  Visage: Good to know I'm loved. :)
23:07  ZombieLoffe: p3lim: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01y
23:07  Aleoss: boogyman: No, the reason isn't about me being banned, the reason is about that Visage is a tyrant kiddie who was given too much authority.
23:08  Aleoss: boogyman: He doesn't have much knowledge of HTML and CSS.
23:08  boogyman: Aleoss: I wouldn't know... it's not my turn to babysit channels :P and/or their OPs
23:09  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: then why doesnt it work in my example?
23:09  ZombieLoffe: p3lim: Dunno. have you linked an example?
23:09  Visage: Aleoss, Totally. You found me out. Congrats bro. <3
23:09  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01w
23:10  Aleoss: boogyman: He tried to tell someone that wanted to draw shapes on an <img> that he can only do that in JS. He doesn't even know that <map> exists apparently.
23:10  boogyman: Where's cannonfodder and cesurasean when you need them :-O lolz
23:10  p3lim: placing it like that within #about, margin-left does not work
23:10  ZombieLoffe: p3lim: Umm... http://www.webdevout.net/test?01z ?
23:11  ZombieLoffe: Or am I totally misunderstanding what you want?
23:12  Aleoss: boogyman: I've seen him refer several people to #JS when their problem can be solved in HTML and/or CSS as I've already stated.
23:12  p3lim: ZombieLoffe: I think I found the error
23:13  p3lim: was doing right: 50%; instead of left
23:13  cesurasean: boogyman, I'm right here.
23:13  ZombieLoffe: p3lim: Sounds like it, yes.. :F
23:14  Aleoss: boogyman: There is another guy with the alias Archanamiya who asked a question who he referred to #JS when his problem has NOTHING to do with JS and in fact was solved with HTML and a server-sided programming language and that is what he wanted. He still failed to recognize this interpretation mistake he had made afterwards as well.
23:15  Aleoss: In fact, he banned Archanamiya afterwards too.
23:15  boogyman: Aleoss: Thanks for holding a grudge... now can we move on?
23:15  Aleoss: Sure if you aren't going to refer people to #HTML. That place is bullshit as long as Visage has +O.
23:16  Visage: ...He loves me. :)
23:16  ZombieLoffe: We'll keep referring people to #html as long as people ask questions related to html :)
23:16  Aleoss: ZombieLoffe: You're ignorant.
23:16  ZombieLoffe: Aleoss: I can sort of see why you got banned
23:16  Aleoss: They should be referred to #web where they'll get better assistance.
23:17  Aleoss: As #web doesn't have abusive ops.
23:17  ZombieLoffe: Let it go, man.
23:17  Visage: </drama>
23:17  boogyman: Aleoss: killswitch and oreocookie can be just as dramatic
23:18  boogyman: not to bring them into this dramatized conversation
23:18  Aleoss: boogyman: Anyone can be dramatic, but the thing is that killswitch and oreocookie aren't capable or else don't ban people who are asking for help or ban people who are of actual assistance.
