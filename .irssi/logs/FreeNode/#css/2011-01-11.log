00:00  _ZofBot4: Bartzy, IE Conditional Comments: http://haslayout.net/condcom
00:00  Bartzy: anyway to avoid conditional comments ?
00:00  publo: hey guys, i'm looking for a CSS reset recommendation, I'm viewing Eric Meyers verision which is very popular, but I dont like how the font-size keeps getting inherited on multiple levels in my webpages over and over again http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
00:00  oksushi: Bartzy: why?
00:01  systemfault: publo: I'd probably use the one in YUI3.
00:01  publo: yui3 huh
00:02  systemfault: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/cssreset/
00:02  publo: yea im there now
00:02  publo: any reason you recommend it over ericmeyers?
00:02  Bartzy: oksushi: I don't want the extra http request...
00:02  Bartzy: and I don't want inline style tags :)
00:02  systemfault: Not really, i'm just recommend it because I actually used it :)
00:03  HappyPelican1: or write your own based on your needs?
00:03  HappyPelican1: not they're a reset is even necessary if you're overriding your resets later on anyway
00:03  HappyPelican1: <insert daily css reset argument here>
00:04  publo: lol
00:04  HappyPelican1: not that*
00:04  oksushi: Bartzy: what extra http request?
00:04  oksushi: sheesh
00:04  systemfault: Heh...
00:04  systemfault: A classic case of technical masturbation.
00:05  dantost1s: I have been stumped can anyone help me is there any way to fix this space http://drupal.org/files/issues/Capture_79.PNG I would be so happy
00:05  systemfault: He probably also use gentoo and program everything in C.
00:05  HappyPelican1: Hack the planet!
00:06 --- HappyPelican1 is now known as HappyPelican
00:06  oksushi: dantost1s: still using a table?
00:08  dantost1s: I tried using the other ones but I cant get the same results i like the style of table
00:08  Bartzy: oksushi: of the extra css file for IE only
00:08  oksushi: Bartzy: you don't need an external css file
00:08  Bartzy: oksushi: So just with style tags ?
00:08  oksushi: Bartzy: you could use this: http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/
00:09  dantost1s: I think my problem is all the content is stacked
00:10  dantost1s: instead of displayed horizonatally

00:23  webPragmatist: I have a question… i have a website which i've set the body font-size to 97% and from there i use pixel font sizes… I have an email i am creating and the same font size doesn't apply in email clients
00:23  publo: sushi do you use a reset ?
00:23  publo: is there an oksushi_reset :)
00:23  webPragmatist: how can i get around this or how can i find the actual equivalent font size?
00:23  dravekx: there
00:24  oksushi: huh?
00:24  publo: CSS reset file i mean
00:24  oksushi: webPragmatist: why the hell would you use 97%?
00:24  webPragmatist: sorry 76%
00:25  oksushi: webPragmatist: looks like you need to check out http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/
00:25  oksushi: then read this: http://24ways.org/2009/rock-solid-html-emails
00:26  webPragmatist: oksushi: hrm
00:27  webPragmatist: so the reason why i originally used 76% in the body it seems I read somewhere that that resets all the browsers to the same "start"
00:27  oksushi: it does
00:27  oksushi: but HTML emails are a different thing altogether
00:27  webPragmatist: oksushi: i understand that… just wondering if there was a best practice in that regard
00:27  webPragmatist: oksushi: I follow the campaignmonitor stuff to the T
00:33  publo: do you guys advocate having font-size in css resets? like is there a point
00:36  oksushi: publo: http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/typography/
00:39  nikonierer_: Usually I use the css reset of Eric Meyer where the font-size is set to 100%. http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
00:40  piklu: the best tool for css and javascript, IDE @ mac?
00:40  publo: sushis link is interesting, talksa bout 76% lol
00:44  oojacoboo: piklu: IDE for css?
00:45  piklu: yeah
00:45  piklu: IDE for web
00:45  oojacoboo: :/
00:46  piklu: should cover everything
00:46  oojacoboo: maybe you would like aptana.com
00:46  oojacoboo: I don't like IDE's for myself though
00:58  publo: i'm looking through Eric Meyers 2011 Reset CSS and Yui Reset, and im just wondering, do you guys advocate removing the font-size: 100% declaration from the massive reset list ? http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/01/10/reset-2-0b2-paring-down/

01:28  coreyw: Is there a way to target the "innermost" element? For example, if I had some nested divs, how could I select only the current one that is being hovered over?
01:28  coreyw: Or is that only possible with JS?
01:29  coreyw: Sorry, not the "innermost", but just the one that is being hovered. No parents, no children.

01:52  bonhoffer: i have to have the ampersand in there
01:52  oksushi: bonhoffer: use &amp;
01:52  oksushi: like it says

02:08  evilaim: all text.
02:08  evilaim: So it'd be like.
02:08  evilaim: Title
02:08  evilaim: -Sub1
02:08  publo: whats better practice, naming CSS classes based on their order in hierarchy of the page? or naming them just as what they are, then targeting them via css
02:09  publo: So for example:     .header  , .headertop , .headerbottom        or  .header, .top , .bottom  ->   .header > .top

02:15  bonhoffer: why does ms keep the name -- they totally need to re-brand ie, at least for web developers

02:38  publo: the container is a div class="header"  , would you guys recommend …      header_nav  , header_logo , header_search ?
02:39  publo: or would the consensus be "navbar" "logo" and "search"

02:43  K3rmit: yep
02:43  oojacoboo: K3rmit: the point of html is to markup your language as semantically correct as possible
02:44  oojacoboo: a definition list is intended to represent items where you are defining a term or phrase
02:44  krambiorix: oksushi, in my hyperlinks, my text is black but the line below the link is red... Now i want to have the line also black... How can i do that? I tried checking with firebug but can't find the reason
02:44  oojacoboo: think, FAQ, dictionary, etc
02:45  bonhoffer: the bottom line is margin:auto doesn't work for ie6
02:45  bonhoffer: i guess i need to have a custom style sheet

03:08  oojacoboo: dakur: position: absolute on the footer
03:09  oojacoboo: why are you using that?

04:43  Yoofie: publo: why dont you put the login status above the nav menu
04:43  Akufen: CSMan you can make one table look like 3 tables I suppose, or put 3 inside another table ;)
04:43  CSMan: table 1 will take all horizontal space
04:44  CSMan: Akufen: I can't make .net do that =/

04:44  CSMan: oh I see what you mean...
04:44  CSMan: nested tables (eww)
04:44  Yoofie: use seperate menus then
04:44  publo: im just confused as to whether i should do 3x <UL>  ?
04:44  CSMan: was thinking maybe css could help
04:44  Yoofie: easier to code, easier to integrate into a CMS
04:44  K3rmit: sushi man?
04:45  Akufen: CSMan it probably can, if you set a width for the table, it should not be taking up the entire width
04:45  Yoofie: 3x ULs
04:45  publo: okay cool
04:45  ogp: i need some help to fix the html on this site; onegreenplanet.org -- the homepage has excerpts listed below recent articles, there are 4, i need code to make it 6
04:45  Yoofie: it really does not matter how you do. You code so that it works with the CMS your using
04:45  K3rmit: oksushi do you know how?
04:46  publo: yea well still i want to code it the way sushi would do it
04:46  K3rmit: also why did you use height:100% for ?
04:46  Yoofie: how would sushi do it?
04:46  Akufen: K3rmit are you using php?
04:47  K3rmit: not really
04:47  Yoofie: ogp: you want to split the two columns so that there is six columns in one row?
04:47  K3rmit: Akufen why do you ask?
04:47  Akufen: K3rmit because you could get the width of the image and set the actual width, instead of a percentage
04:47  ogp: <yoofie> how can i do that.
04:48  ogp: i dont have any html knowledge :(
04:48  Yoofie: ... :/
04:48  Yoofie: using wordpress?
04:48  K3rmit: Akufen I am using a php anyway....how could I find the width then?
04:49  Akufen: K3rmit also, I believe that an image with a image set as a percentage suffers the same rendering issue as an image without its dimensions set
04:50  Akufen: K3rmit: http://php.net/manual/en/function.getimagesize.php
04:50  K3rmit: Akufen so basically you're telling me to not do it that way and resize it
04:50  ogp: yes <yoofie> its wordpress
04:51  Yoofie: craptacular theme. the code is hideous
04:51  Akufen: K3rmit well it depends on the difference in kilobytes resizing it would save, but it's not required
04:51  temhawk: btw i thought a percentage width on an image will scale it based on the parent's width, not the image's original width
04:51  Akufen: K3rmit just get the actual dimension, divide it by 2, and set that as the width/height, instead of using percentages
04:52  Yoofie: ogp: you want all six column in that one content area? thats wayy too small...
04:52  Aliv3: hey
04:52  K3rmit: ok
04:53  K3rmit: thanks
04:53  Akufen: K3rmit normally you'd solve this on input instead of on output though :)
04:53  ogp: i want 2 extra rows.
04:53  ogp: so it would be 2,2,2
04:53  ogp: right now its 2,2
04:53  K3rmit: Akufen what do you mean?
04:54  Akufen: K3rmit for instance, get the image dimensions when you upload it, save it to database, so that you can get it in the query when you're using the image
04:55  Akufen: that whay you're the only one waiting for that operation to finish, instead of every visitor on your site, however short it may be
04:56  K3rmit: oh i see
04:56  foo: Anyone happen to know an alternative to absolute positioning? I am trying to position a back button and stick it to the right of the screen, but it breaks on a certain page with jquery and I'm not sure why.
04:57  temhawk: foo: float it right maybe
04:57  oksushi: an alternative?
04:57  temhawk: text-align might also do it
04:58  foo: temhawk: I am doing it on the same line with an h2 header. The problem if I float it right is that it is below the h2 header on the right, but I want them on the same line. hmm
04:58  oksushi: foo: sounds like you are Doing It Wrong
04:58  Akufen: foo have you checked the width of the h2?
04:59  foo: oksushi: :)
04:59  foo: Akufen: heh, no... actually.
04:59 * foo does
04:59  publo: how do you float right 2 elements, but get the one that appears second in the code, to appear second in the page?
04:59  publo: i dont want to position them in reverse in the code just to make it work visually
05:02  foo: Akufen: hm, looks like it is taking width 100%
05:02  foo: Akufen: is there a way I can just tell it to use the width of the text within the div?
05:03  Akufen: display inline?
05:03  temhawk: foo: floating it will do that iirc
05:04  Akufen: yes, unless your name is internet explorer
05:04  foo: haha
05:04  temhawk: —__—
05:04  Akufen: maybe it's just 6 though, I'm not sure about 7
05:10  ogp: i need some help to fix the html on this site; onegreenplanet.org -- the homepage has excerpts listed below recent articles, there are 4, i need code to make it 6
05:11  marky_b: change the sql?
05:14  foo: temhawk / Akufen - thanks, I'm getting closer. So, I have an h2 title with 5 words, then I have an image outside the h2 following it. Do I need to make the h2 display inline if I want to float the back button to the right and have it on the same line as the title?
05:14  JoeNeedsHelp: Is a div ok to use as my login-bar and to hold my soon-to-be slidedown button?
05:15  JoeNeedsHelp: http://seekit.com
05:15  foo: temhawk / Akufen - looks like if I float left the h2, and float right the back button, I get what I want. Does it sound like I'm doing it an ok way?
05:16  temhawk: foo: just floating the image/button to the right should put both the h2 and the image/button on the same line
05:16  Akufen: foo yes that works, floated elements collapse to the width of the content of the element
05:16  foo: Akufen: yeah, hmm, ok, thanks
05:16  temhawk: :) bye
05:17  Akufen: foo, infact, since your h2 is not a 'container' you probably wont have to worry about IE support
05:19  Akufen: bedtime, g'night
05:20  foo: Akufen: ok, thank you!

05:29  oksushi: marky_b: that depends
05:30  JoeNeedsHelp: really?

06:15  chouchou: no one is there,
06:15  chouchou: the room is silent
06:15  oksushi: K3rmit: fix your markup first. Use a proper doctype

06:17  chouchou: well, just a sketch... a mockup, I will perfect it
06:17  chouchou: even an idea
06:26  K3rmit: oksushi whats wrong with my doctype?
06:26  oksushi: transitional?
06:27  K3rmit: no good?
06:27  oksushi: you know what's wrong
06:27  K3rmit: you want strict
06:27  oksushi: it's your site
06:28  K3rmit: yea currently its transitional
06:28  K3rmit: don't specifically know the big diff beyond common sense of the wording strict vs transitional
06:29  oksushi: transitional was there to assist people /transitioning/ from older versions of html
06:29  juboba: hey
06:29  juboba: how can I make the body use the 100% of height?
06:30  juboba: it stays the size of the window
06:30  oksushi: juboba: http://www.pud.ca/misc/testcase/fullheight.html
06:31  K3rmit: oksushi thats in regard to?
06:31  oksushi: huh? You said you didn't understand the difference
06:32  juboba: oksushi: I want exactly the opposite
06:32  K3rmit: the link
06:33  K3rmit: ohh my bad oksushi you were giving the link to juboba. Anyway yea its changed to strict
06:33  juboba: I want the height to be dependant on the content
06:33  juboba: not on the browser's size
06:33  K3rmit: oksushi hows it looking now then before :D
06:34  juboba: huh?
06:34  juboba: look
06:34  juboba: juboba.sytes.net/jubobanew
06:35  juboba: I'm trying to make the body grow if the text excedes the height
06:40  juboba: any clue
06:40  juboba: ?
06:42  oksushi: juboba: a) remove the 'height: 100%' from #container
06:43  oksushi: b) just link to http://patrianet.sytes.net/juboba/jubobanew/ to avoid the shitty frames
06:43  juboba: sry
06:43  oksushi: however, that page lacks a doctype, and requires one
06:43  oksushi: put <!DOCTYPE html> as the first thing on that page
06:43  juboba: how do I create a DOCTYPE?
06:43  juboba: just that?
06:44  juboba: uhm
06:45  oksushi: then you need to containt he floated children
06:45  oksushi: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
06:45  JoeNeedsHelp: oksushi: for the one link and image background, should i also put that in a list or is a div good for that one?
06:45  JoeNeedsHelp: because right now i have it in a div
06:45  K3rmit: oksushi hows my page looking you think? I always learned to use <br '/'> or <img '/'> but now strict tells me not to use it.... I wonder why transitional even included that. I'm getting an error still while validating it says no such "xmlns" ? I copied and pasted code for strict...

06:55  K3rmit: like you :D
06:55  juboba: xD
06:55  oksushi: K3rmit: I guess you’ll have to make your own decisions. Starting with reading the pages I just linked you to would be a good start
06:56  oksushi: instead of just "he said, she said"
06:56  K3rmit: agreed
06:56  K3rmit: I like getting other opinions too of course
06:57  K3rmit: so you think its ludacrous or just a tight battle and controversy one over the other
06:59  juboba: chouchou: uhm, what is it for?
06:59  chouchou: the logo is for a website,
06:59  juboba: do u have the website?
06:59  chouchou: http://www.unglitch.com
06:59  chouchou: initially, troubleshooting, bug fixing, additionally, do-it-yourself stuffs. later, highlighting ignored issues
07:00  juboba: the Un has nothing to do with the rest
07:00  juboba: chouchou: is that the set of colors u are using?
07:01  chouchou: for the website or logo?
07:01  juboba: I mean the theme of the site
07:02  juboba: I don't picture the logo with that colors
07:02  JoeNeedsHelp: i've been reading many different sources and some say use buttons for forms and others suggest not
07:02  JoeNeedsHelp: should i ?
07:02  chouchou: juboba: it was originally a brown colour with a different theme which I later changed
07:02  juboba: oh
07:03  juboba: JoeNeedsHelp: u mean submit the form with an image or link?.
07:03  paleywiener: hey which do you think has potential to look good (in other words, does the green/ thingy look okay?? man! my idiot sib says that the colors don't match): http://www.grex.org/~veek/green/ http://www.grex.org/~veek/ http://cyberspace.org/

07:06  chouchou: ok
07:06  chouchou: but it's just a mockup I did, I want to have some definite nice logo
07:06  oksushi: chouchou: then pay a designer

07:08  JoeNeedsHelp: really?
07:08  oksushi: imo
07:08  juboba: JoeNeedsHelp: as I said before: it depends on the designer

07:09  juboba: JoeNeedsHelp: you may use whatever to submit
07:09  JoeNeedsHelp: ok...because i was reading w3schools and they said not too
07:09  JoeNeedsHelp: so i was double checking with you
07:10  JoeNeedsHelp: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp
07:10  oksushi: …
07:10  JoeNeedsHelp: Important: If you use the button element in an HTML form, different browsers will submit different values. Internet Explorer will submit the text between the <button> and </button> tags, while other browsers will submit the content of the value attribute. Use the input element to create buttons in an HTML form.
07:10  oksushi: JoeNeedsHelp: you need to stop reading that Web site
07:10  JoeNeedsHelp: lol fair enough

07:15  JoeNeedsHelp: and if you have 1 anchor with 1 image background, should you still use a ul or is a div more appropriate?
07:22  atan2: JoeNeedsHelp, if it's a list of links with only 1 it's still a list
07:22  JoeNeedsHelp: gotcha
07:22  atan2: Generally you will <ul> all that unless it's inline with your text.
07:23  atan2: Come visit my <a...> my website </a> when you get a minute is fine
07:23  JoeNeedsHelp: so if i just list one link out there, it should be in a ul?
07:23  atan2: What's the link for?
07:23  JoeNeedsHelp: just to visit a facebook page
07:23  atan2: Is it navigation or is it part of the page content?

07:24  JoeNeedsHelp: the social networks are in a dl
07:24  JoeNeedsHelp: but the rss should be in a ul?
07:25  atan2: I don't see any RSS links on the page.
07:25  JoeNeedsHelp: look at the right
07:25  atan2: Well yes then, that should be a UL.
07:25  JoeNeedsHelp: it says subscribe to our feed
07:25  JoeNeedsHelp: oh ok
07:25  JoeNeedsHelp: weird...i would have never thought to use a ul for only one link
07:25  JoeNeedsHelp: that's really good to know
07:26  atan2: Turn styles off and look at your content. If the link looks stupid, it needs a ul.
07:26  atan2: Inline links should look fine, but navigation type stuff is at home in a <ul>
07:26  atan2: You have a list of 4 links over there ;) they should all be in one UL really I do suppose
07:26 * atan2 runs off

10:46  Shay128: for now in my css there is a line :
10:46  Shay128: header h1 span { padding-top:7px}
10:47  Shay128: how can i set the id in this line ?
10:47  oksushi: ]css select @ Shay128

10:47  rosstitute: hey. I'm using jQuery's ui-corner-bl css class. I have an <li> with a :hover defined in its css definition. When i roll over the li, it looses the ui-corner-bl class ? any ideas as to why this is happening ?
10:47  oksushi: rosstitute: perhaps it is overridden with a more specific selector?
10:48  rosstitute: i dont *think* so
10:48  oksushi: firebug will tell you what is happening
10:49  rosstitute: good call
11:00  stygyan: hello guys
11:04  Sanshi: hey stygyan
11:04  stygyan: what's up?
11:04  stygyan: i think i solved the problem i had, but let's wait
11:05  Sanshi: nothing much, just some working :)
11:05  rosstitute: is there an inline method for applying css to IE only? something like <!--[if IE]> but in the css body?
11:13  iaj: hmm what is the common way to have a mail: telephone: .... aligned correctly?? so that the phone numbers are starting at the same place?
11:19  treebeen: rosstitute: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter
11:26  iaj: lo there - how can I make the DIV.csc-header use margin-top: 0em; if its on top of the page in my case?  http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=48 
11:30  iaj: nevermind got it solved.
11:45  rosstitute: i've got a superfish (jquery) menu, the menu drops down using <li>'s. In firefox everything is fine however in IE8, the dropdown menu falls BEHIND other page elements such as the depicted <fieldset>, see http://sixby9.co.uk/IEProblem.jpg any suggestions ? quite stuck on this
11:55  sullivan0: rosstitute: stupid question but have you set the z-index s
11:55  sullivan0: ?
11:57  rosstitute: sullivan0: i dont think position absolute can be set
11:59  sullivan0: why not?
11:59  sullivan0: @ rosstitute
12:00  rosstitute: because the position is relative
12:00  sullivan0: so wrap the item in another div and position that absolute (absolute to the top level relative element)
12:01  sullivan0: div / span w/e
12:01  sullivan0: not semantically great but if it solves the issue so be it
12:02  sullivan0: and if it doesn't then maybe have a look in IE dev toolbar and make sure the element hasLayout
12:02  sullivan0: and that is 'hasLayout'
12:04  sullivan0: and before you do anything else... is your code xhtml valid?
12:04  sullivan0: rosstitute: make sure your code is valid before anything else tbh... the amount of times ive seen simple validity causing issues.

12:20  Engin: two classes button, disabled. button has :hover state too. I want the :hover state to be disabled when class "disabled" added
12:20  Engin: any idea ?
12:21  Engin: more specifically, button:hover has a background-image change... I want to suppress it, no change to the background-image in "button" class itself
12:21  sullivan0: can we see the page or is it local hosted?
12:21  sullivan0: @ Engin
12:22  Engin: at the moment local
12:22  Engin: i can paste the css right away thoguh
12:22  sullivan0: Id prefer to see the whole thing...
12:22  Engin: not possible at the moment, the local running server is only available to localhost
12:23  Engin: http://codepad.org/SZoHLRYr
12:23  Engin: this is the css anyway
12:23  Engin: the disabled:hover attempts to override/suppress next:hover... with no success
12:24  sullivan0: add ! important; after the css declaration
12:25  sullivan0: i.e. in the rule you want to make sure is never over ridden use color:#fff ! important;
12:25  sullivan0: or you can make sure the rule has higher precendence by making the selector more specific i.e. using the whole chain of elements to select it
12:26  sullivan0: #id div .elemClass.elemClass { // rules }
12:26  Engin: I don't think we are on the same page
12:27  Engin: <div class="button disabled"/>
12:27  Engin: .button{} .button:hover{}
12:27  sullivan0: yes it wasnt meant to be for your code... just general rules - let me see your paste
12:27  Engin: I just want to suppress .button:hover all together
12:28  sullivan0: you cant suppress it.. you can only apply styling to match what ever the !:hover is
12:29  Engin: yeah I think so, just tried my luck
12:29  sullivan0: i.e if you want the button to appear the same as when its not being hovered then copy the non:hover styling
12:29  sullivan0: remove pointer, border changes etc
12:30  Engin: I can do it in various ways, just tryin to put the burden on CSS :)
12:30  sullivan0: you cant remove browser DOM events without hacking the browser
12:41  jusme: hello all!
12:42  jusme: I'm having a CSS problem....can someone help?
12:42  sullivan0: fire away jusme
12:43  jusme: thx sullivan0
12:44  jusme: I have an image that i want to use as a background image.....but.....it's bigger than my div ..........so i set my div height and width to lets say.....
12:44  jusme: 960 x 150......
12:45  jusme: and my background image to my file stored on disk.
12:45  jusme: ....[]
12:45  jusme: however...
12:45  jusme: my image shows up larger than the original image.
12:46  jusme: this is a header image by the way
12:46  jusme: it's like my image is being magnified
12:46  sullivan0: you cant set widths and heights on background images
12:46  sullivan0: make your background image the right size for the container
12:47  jusme: well....i only set the width and height on the containing div
12:47  sullivan0: yes that wont affect the background image size. It should stay 100% of original (the 'magnification' is odd issue... are you sure
12:48  hans_: what about using a img and set the Z-index to the background?
12:48  jusme: i was trying to use the technique that sprites use......are you familiar with sprites.....i want to show just a certain aspect or portion of a given image.
12:48  hans_: then you can scale
12:48  sullivan0: yes I know sprites
12:49  sullivan0: are you saying that you want to crop your background image to just the size of the containing div?
12:49  jusme: sullivan0>  yes.....i guess i want to crop my pic for my header to a certain size
12:50  sullivan0: do you want the code to crop a background image? i.e. as a sprite?
12:51  sullivan0: i.e. in a div?
12:52  jusme: but also i want to not only crop (well crop may not be true) I want to select a certain starting and ending point in the original pic....similar to sprites
12:52  hans_: smashingmagazine.com has a few nice articles about css and sprites. I have only used them one time to play with.
12:54  sullivan0: okay one sec
12:54  hans_: like this one: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/31/transparent-css-sprites/
12:54  sullivan0: yes i understand
12:54  sullivan0: there is a caveat
12:54  sullivan0: but one sec
12:54  jusme: thx
12:54  jusme: thx hans !
12:54  hans_: np, hope it helps
12:54  jusme: i've been looking at articles all night....(all day) and can't fix my problem.......i love software problems .... :(
12:55  jusme: btw....i'm joining from japan.....what time is it there?
12:56  hans_: about 13h00
12:56  jusme: where u @ hans?
12:56  sullivan0: jusme: <div style="background:url('wsfp.png') 10px 10px;height:100px;width:100px">

12:57 --- Cain` is now known as Cain
12:57  jusme: @sullivan>   thanx ....  let me try
12:57  sullivan0: you can only set the x1, y1 on the background image. to crop the right hand bottom side it is dependant on the width and height of this div
12:58  jusme: ok...that is good information sullivan!
12:58  sullivan0: so my example shows the image from 10,10 to 110,110
12:58  jusme: bathroom break
12:58  jusme: ok
13:01  jusme: sullivan .... what was your example again?
13:02  jusme: sorry
13:02  jusme: oh ..

13:14  aitiba: how can I put label and text on a line on the form of http://www.aitoribanez.com/que-hacemos/programacion/ ?
13:14  aitiba: i0m getting crazy
13:15  dravekx: you mean you're turning sane
13:17  sriley: aitiba: change the markup http://assemblesoft.com/examples/form/
13:17  muszek: aitiba: removing the <br> would be a good start
13:21  aitiba: muszel, i'm using wordpress and I have to remove the <br> using dislay: none
13:21  aitiba: i use div#wpcf7-f3-p292-o1 .wpcf7-form p br {display: none}
13:21  sriley: im sure wordpress doesnt force you to have that markup
13:21  aitiba: i dont know how can i keep this markup
13:26  muszek: aitiba: I'm pretty sure you need to change the html, not just css... it's just not very flexible (br being just one example)
13:26  muszek: aitiba: look at the url that sriley gave you, that's all you need

13:35 --- chouchou_ is now known as chouchou
14:19  Axcy: Hey guys, I've got a bit of a problem - On a site a costumer wants all links to have a dotted line under them, but the problem is that this causes all my image link within content to have this dotted line under it as well :/
14:22  ZombieLoffe: Axcy, easiest solution would probably be to put a class on all links containing an image and not set the border for that class
14:23  Axcy: ZombieLoffe: Using a CMS, and it puts a link on some, and not on others?
14:24  ZombieLoffe: Uh... what?
14:24  Axcy: Sorry, bad exp
14:25  Axcy: I'm using a Content management system, and unfortunately some image-links have a specific class, while others simply have none :/
14:25  ZombieLoffe: so make sure they do.
14:25  ZombieLoffe: Or you could use JS to detect what a link contains and style it accordingly, but that's an ugly solution if you ask me.
14:26  Axcy: True, must be some way to force all image links to have a specific class assigned

14:45 --- chouchou_ is now known as chouchou
14:55  Axcy: What's the difference between "a" and "a:link" ? :s
15:01  RonaldJ: is it possible to make a link in a certain position in a image?
15:02  speak: Axcy unless i understand your question incorrectly, couldn't you do something like #content img a { text-decoration: none }  ?
15:02  ZombieLoffe: Axcy: a:link targets links that have not been visited.
15:03  ZombieLoffe: speak: That selector would mean "any a inside img"... doesn't make sense.
15:03  ZombieLoffe: RonaldJ: Yes... easiest would probably be to put the image as a background to some containing element and position the <a> absolutely on top of it
15:04  MauriceJ: RonaldJ: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap/
15:06  speak: ZombieLoffe okay, i understand... other way around then? :D *durr*
15:07  ZombieLoffe: Not without either a) Using JS or b) Applying classes to the links containing images.
15:07  Axcy: ZombieLoffe: Then what's the function of "a" alone when nothing is specified, such as :link or :hover
15:08  ZombieLoffe: Axcy, it selects any <a>.
15:09  ZombieLoffe: a:link selects only non-visited links, a:visited selects visited links
15:09  RonaldJ: Thanks MauriceJ !

15:11  ogp: umm, i dont really dont cause i dont know html or css
15:11  ogp: :(
15:11  ogp: yes i am looking for html help!
15:12  ZombieLoffe: ogp: It has nothing to do with either HTML or CSS, really. :P
15:12  ogp: so what do i do?
15:12  ogp: i am a writer for the site
15:12  MauriceJ: ogp: I'm afraid we are here to help people, not to give them code.  You're misunderstanding is that we will do code for you when in fact you need to learn how to do HTML/CSS and then you can get assistance with already extent code.
15:12  ZombieLoffe: I'm guessing some CMS is generating the front page. Configure your CMS to display more items.
15:13  ZombieLoffe: Either way, it has nothing to do with CSS.
15:13  ogp: ok i gotcha.
15:13  ogp: thank u
15:13  iaj: hmmm, http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46  what's the right property to have the ul
15:14  Axcy: ZombieLoffe: Thank you for all your help! Much appreciated
15:14  ZombieLoffe: No problem.
15:14  iaj: eg the lis in the ul indented the same way like the line above?
15:14  ZombieLoffe: iaj: list-style-position: inside; on the <li>s, or apply some margin-left.

15:27  bfred: or maybe sematicism
15:27  bfred: *semanticism
15:27  bfred: a stick? :o
15:27  MauriceJ: No, semantics are for philosophy majors who love to sit and do intellectual masturbation.
15:27  ZombieLoffe: And people interested in decent html.
15:28  MauriceJ: bfred:  Yes, our preacher visits our homes with his stick and beats the hell out of anybody misusing the religion.
15:29  MauriceJ: ZombieLoffe: I'm only refering to the non-HTML semantics.
15:29  ZombieLoffe: Are there other kinds? ;)
15:29  bfred: MauriceJ: LOL
15:30  ZombieLoffe: Whenever someone uses the expression "Let's not argue semantics" or something similar I always think of HTML first and foremost... are they arguing whether to use an <ul> or <dl>?
15:30  jomofcw: Maurice is there a non-HTML semantic :x ? What the hell could it be ?
15:30  MauriceJ: jomofcw: Before HTML there was semantics.
15:30  ZombieLoffe: Yeah, but they weren't important.
15:30  jomofcw: omfg ! dude ! what's that... nothing exists before HTML ^^

15:34  MauriceJ: bfred:  :/ No, I'm already disappointed with it as it is.
15:34  bfred: ah
15:35  jomofcw: Yep, I agree with MauriceJ
15:35  jomofcw: [you should be affraid about yourself too so]
15:35  bfred: jomofcw: :(
15:35  MauriceJ: Things were supposed to be amazing with new technology and instead it's just ignorance with better ways to screw things up.  I am scared of the future.
15:35  jomofcw: But sure, I hope the world in fifty year will be a IE free world :)

15:43  jomofcw: Procrastination (Thief of Time) est le vingt-septième volume de la série Les Annales du Disque-monde, écrite par le romancier anglais Terry Pratchett. Paru originellement en 2001, il a été publié en France en septembre 2005 chez l'éditeur l'Atalante et est traduit par Patrick Couton.
15:43  jomofcw: that's more geek !
15:44  systemfault: OMG! On parle français ici?
15:44  systemfault: On est rendu cultivés
15:44  MauriceJ: Pratchett est chouette.
15:44  sriley: a lot of the standards have come about from what ie did 10 years ago
15:44  MauriceJ: Cultivated my procrastinating arse.
15:45  jomofcw: systemfault nop, that's just a dream, you can wake up now :)
15:45  jomofcw: sriley sure
15:45  systemfault: Ok.. then you'll all have to live with my "not so bad" english.
15:45  jomofcw: but if something is good in past that doesn't mean it will be good in future and in present
15:45  ZombieLoffe: Doesn't change the fact that IE was quite slow in adopting actually important parts of CSS2 ;<
15:46  sriley: so to blaim ie for not supporting standard x when the standard came about 10 years after it had implemented it is a little unfair
15:46  MauriceJ: 10 Years ago IE did some cool stuff but it's not implementing standards today so I can't really cut them any slack.
15:46  tw2113: IE6 used to be the best browser, but then they sat on their ass for much of the next decade
15:46  sriley: about the only part of css2 that ie was lacking is the child selector, ie7 fixed that
15:46  systemfault: In the C world, C99 is 12 years old and GCC still doesn't implement it fully :P
15:47  tw2113: what about css2.1?
15:47  MauriceJ: 10 Years ago is a long time ago, it's gone to hell since then.  It's like saying that the Twin Towers are a standard to hold other skyscrapers to in terms of height when in fact they have been gone for nearly 10 years now.
15:48  jomofcw: systemfault je compatis pour l'anglais très moyen :)
15:48  systemfault: Merci :)
15:48  ZombieLoffe: sriley, display: table/cell/row
15:48  sriley: ZombieLoffe: how often is that really needed?
15:48  ZombieLoffe: it's immensly useful in some cases
15:49  jomofcw: sriley it could be needed, but we don't use it because it doesn't work on it
15:49  jomofcw: actually, we don't use lot of css feature (to talk only about it) because IE doesn't support it.
15:49  sriley: yes instead we have other techniques that work
15:49  ZombieLoffe: but yeah, there's quite a bit missing from ie6 -- http://www.webdevout.net/browser-support-css#css2standards
15:49  jomofcw: And we learn how to do without those
15:49  jomofcw: sriley yea, if the bridge is break, we could construct a boat...
15:50  systemfault: We can really begin to "ignore" IE6...
15:50  ZombieLoffe: IE6 wasn't bad when it came out -- it just became horrible because it stuck around so long
15:50  systemfault: At work, IE7+ is the target.
15:50  ZombieLoffe: IE7 was released, what, 8 years after IE6? And even then, adoption was fairly slow
15:50  jomofcw: systemfault I have already beguin
15:50  tw2113: the users and user demand vastly outpaced IE development
15:50  jomofcw: begun
15:50  systemfault: ZombieLoffe: Correction, Vista's adoption was fairly slow.
15:51  ZombieLoffe: Eh... and ie7 adoption.
15:51  tw2113: vista had wonderful anti-piracy built in
15:51  systemfault: Well.. A side-effect.
15:51  systemfault: tw2113: Yeah right..
15:51  sriley: tbh id also say that using display:table etc is also a "technique we have to learn"
15:51  tw2113: no one wanted to pirate a steaming pile of poo
15:51  systemfault: Vista actually became usable after SP1
15:52  jomofcw: just usable, no more
15:52  systemfault: Yep

15:53  MauriceJ: Linux works.
15:53  systemfault: It has its share of problems...
15:53  systemfault: But it's a "saner" choice.
15:54  MauriceJ: I didn't realise how much I swore, screamed, or had raised blood pressure using a computer until I got linux that all stopped.
15:54  jomofcw: I'm a gamer, I can't use those :(.
15:54  ZombieLoffe: I've had zero problems with windows 7 so far
15:54  ZombieLoffe: hurp durp
15:54  systemfault: I never had any problem with Windows since Windows 2000
15:54  jomofcw: zero prob with Win7 too... but...
15:54  MauriceJ: I've tried Windows 3.1 through 7 and MacOS9 through Snow Leaopard as well.
15:54  jomofcw: And so... that's the troll day today :D
15:55  MauriceJ: Windows 7 didn't even have the ability to search documents for a search term until people complained.
15:55  MauriceJ: What the hell is that?
15:55  jomofcw: I start linux on Mandrake :/
15:55  ZombieLoffe: We should probably cut this discussion short before it becomes nerdragefest
15:56  systemfault: I started on slackware.. haha
15:56  jomofcw: :P
15:56  systemfault: Then came back to windows.
15:56  MauriceJ: I just have noobs get used to linux and terminal on Ubuntu then find their favourite flavour after they're comfortable.
15:56  systemfault: (Too hard)
15:56  jomofcw: yea ZombieLoffe is right ^^

15:57  ZombieLoffe: Not unless it's raining and I'm missing an umbrella.
15:58  MauriceJ: Well, okay then!
15:59  MauriceJ: Our CSS, who art in presentation, Style.css be thy name.
16:05  iaj: hmm when I got a div with margin-top: 2em... and then got a div inside which I want to put to the place, where margin-top would be zero.. how could I reach that?
16:06  iaj: i tried margin-top: -2em but the contents then get erased :\
16:06  ZombieLoffe: margin-top: -2em; on the element and overflow: visible; on the parent
16:07  ZombieLoffe: (overflow: visible; is the default value)
16:08  danmichel: im looking at someones css and it says font size is 82.5. what's that in pixels?
16:08  MauriceJ: 82.5 What?
16:09  ZombieLoffe: danmichel, it's invalid... font-size values need a unit
16:09  ZombieLoffe: (unless it's 0)
16:09  danmichel: MauriceJ ZombieLoffe http://www.whitezine.com/
16:09  ZombieLoffe: probably supposed to be 82.5%
16:09  danmichel: yeah
16:09  MauriceJ: ZombieLoffe: That's what I was thinking myself but just in case thought I'd find that out.
16:10  danmichel: 82.5%
16:10  danmichel: whats 82.5% in pixels?
16:10  bfred: danmichel: 1px
16:10  bfred: or 100px
16:10  iaj: ZombieLoffe: thanks that worked flawlessly :)) now if the div its inside got padding-right: 14px set.. and I wanna use that space as well... I can use -14px?
16:10  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Use. margin-left: -14px;.
16:11  ZombieLoffe: Sure*, lol.
16:11  danmichel: bfred: i dont get it
16:11  ZombieLoffe: danmichel: That just means "82.5% of currently applied font-size"
16:11  bfred: danmichel: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/relafont/
16:11  danmichel: ZombieLoffe: but he doesnt have a ciurrently applied font size
16:11  ZombieLoffe: danmichel: Then it uses the browser default, which is whatever the user set it to
16:11  bfred: danmichel: this is quicker: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/520939/css-font-size-relative-vs-absolute-values-which-to-use
16:12  danmichel: i see
16:12  danmichel: thanks guys
16:12  ZombieLoffe: danmichel: Which is very good practice, btw -- you should always let the user set the base font-size
16:12  iaj: ZombieLoffe: but if I use margin-left it will lose its actual position... :-(
16:13  ZombieLoffe: iaj, well, you can't use negative padding values.
16:13  bfred: danmichel: AFAIK 1em = 100% = inherited font size, which might be the default size of the browser, which is usually 16px
16:13  iaj: ZombieLoffe: would there be a way to extend it to the left after using margin-right: -14px ?
16:13  danmichel: ok thanks
16:14  iaj: or is my goal only reachable by using position: absolute; ?
16:15  bfred: iaj: position: relative is also a good option
16:15  bfred: position: relative; left: -14px
16:16  Qci: is ther a problem with underline in <a> in IE?
16:17  iaj: bfred: when I use pos:relative I need to use pos: absolute on the upper div?
16:17  ZombieLoffe: no, iaj
16:17  ZombieLoffe: Qci: Not that I know of

16:43  user_corrupt: I have an absolute positioned div which contains three image links (rss, facebook, and twitter), and the images are appearing one on top of the other...how can I make them appear in sequence from left to right? www.danielbombardier.com
16:43  plow: float
16:43  plow: user_corrupt: float:left for exampl
16:44  plow: user_corrupt: set them to relative positioned too
16:44  plow: anyone able to help me with my question? :)
16:45  user_corrupt: plow: thanks man, though it isnt working for some reason
16:46  plow: user_corrupt: do you want to paste the full code you're referring to?
16:46  airco: if padding is displayed as 3px 3px 3px 3px, which on is padding-top?
16:48  user_corrupt: line 97: http://www.pastie.org/1448550
16:48  user_corrupt: airco: according to my own quick googling, its the first one
16:49  ZombieLoffe: airco: top right bottom left -- like a clock
16:49  ZombieLoffe: plow: Got a link?
16:50  plow: ok
16:50  airco: zombieloffe, thanks that's an easy way to remember :)
16:50  ZombieLoffe: indeed :)
16:53  iaj: is there some way to take influence on the border-bottom of a h1.. eg .. increase its spacing?
16:54  ZombieLoffe: user_corrupt: Remove clear: both; from the imgs
16:55  iaj: oh i think with line-height :-) and margin-bottom..   ZombieLoffe is it wise to chose overflow: auto ? 
16:55  ZombieLoffe: iaj, for what purpose?
16:57  plow: here's the code http://pastie.org/1448560, here's the pic http://yfrog.com/gy6sg5p
16:57  plow: ZombieLoffe: I don't know what to make of it
16:58  ZombieLoffe: plow, make a test-case replicating the problem at www.webdevout.net/test -- we really can't help much without playing with the code
16:58  plow: ZombieLoffe: no probs
16:59  iaj: ZombieLoffe: well look. i don't know how to fix my site ;)  if you go to http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46  its fine.. but if theres a larger content that's extending the min-height property of div.main... its looking weird: http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=3
17:01  user_corrupt: ZombieLoffe: thanks man
17:01  plow: ZombieLoffe: the 'shopping_area' should scroll down too http://www.webdevout.net/test?01Y

17:08  Sceak: Is there any way to suppress an automatic break after an element?
17:09  Sceak: I have a <ul> in a <td style="vertical-align: middle"> and the automatic break aligns the list half a line above the center.
17:10  Sceak: I'd really like to fix this without absolute positioning or tweaks to the element itself.
17:11  Sceak: Anyone?
17:11  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Ah, yeah, yes. You need to contain the float, and for that purpose, overflow: auto; works great.
17:12  ZombieLoffe: plow: Sounds like you want position: fixed;, not absolute
17:12  plow: ZombieLoffe: haven't tried that before, I'll test it in ie ow
17:12  iaj: contain the float? what does that mean...hmm when I use overflow: auto.. its somehow getting disorderd:(
17:12  iaj: thanks btw :)
17:13  ZombieLoffe: iaj, read http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/
17:13  plow: ZombieLoffe: that only puts it in the top left for IE, nothing changes for chrome, ffox
17:14  ZombieLoffe: Sceak: Don't use tables for layout. Anyway, seems like your issue shouldn't happen if there aren't any margins or paddings applied. Try setting margin: 0; on the <ul>.
17:15  ZombieLoffe: plow, http://www.webdevout.net/test?01Z&raw appears the same in Fx, Chrome and IE8 for me... I might be misunderstanding what you're asking
17:16  plow: ZombieLoffe: ah it is working
17:16  Sceak: yeah i just remembered that.  it'snot a break it's a top and bnottom margin.
17:16  plow: ZombieLoffe: much gracias! :)

17:20  user_corrupt: how to you make a label display when you float mouse over an image link?
17:20  iaj: ZombieLoffe: I tried that solution but it just doesn't get aligned anymore when I use overflow: auto... did I make something wrong on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46 ?
17:21  ZombieLoffe: iaj, what isn't aligned?
17:21  ZombieLoffe: user_corrupt, use the title attribute on either the <a> or <img>
17:21  ZombieLoffe: eg. <a title="appears on hover">
17:23  iaj: ZombieLoffe: the 'Auf einen Blick' div.... it should usually use margin-top: -20px... and margin-left.. but it isn't :(
17:23  iaj: oh.. the left is used.. the left isn't :(
17:24  ZombieLoffe: iaj, it doesn't even if you have overflow: visible; on .main
17:24  iaj: containing element is refering to the div that had my overflow:
17:24  iaj: ZombieLoffe: huh? I just tried it does... http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=46
17:25  ZombieLoffe: iaj, you should probably use the other method described in the article I linked you, eg. the one involving :after and so on
17:25  iaj: ZombieLoffe: yeah.. Im trying with :after actually... im just a bit confused... what does #foo in my case refer to...  div.main no?
17:25  ZombieLoffe: yes
17:26  iaj: got it set up exactly as described then.. but doesn't work.. :(
17:26  iaj: omg,
17:27  iaj: i have to get rid of overflow: .. completely.. ohmy.. sorry.
17:28  iaj: another little issue.. if a li goes over multiple lines and I have set up   li { list-style-position: inside; }  how can I make it indent?
17:30  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Instead of doing list-style-position: inside; do list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 1em;
17:30  will_hough: iaj: with a margin
17:33  pngl: I just noticed that the margin of an element does not affect the size of its containing block. Could someone explain why to me?
17:33  will_hough: because the margin is outside of the element
17:34  ZombieLoffe: pngl, margin is the space between the element's edges and the container's edges... why would it increase the size?
17:34  pngl: But this causes a lot of problems when calculating the height of a container. You have to account for the extra space that the first and last container elements will occupy.
17:35  will_hough: exactly
17:35  pngl: er, "that the first and last containeD will occupy".
17:35  ZombieLoffe: yup.
17:35  ZombieLoffe: I don't see how margin increasing the container's size would fix that..
17:36  pngl: ok. I understand the reasoning. Still, there should a simple concept to represent "the *actual* total space occupied by an element (including any space generated by its children)".
17:36  ZombieLoffe: meh.
17:36  will_hough: math
17:37  pngl: ok, I'm really complaining about nothing here. Thanks for the explanation :)

Essentially, though, I cannot work out  despite following exactly instructions in a book (and clarifying online) how to make an html page 'read' a css file. I have specified the css file in my HTML doc as described here: http://w3processing.com/index.php?subMenuId=181
18:45  ComradeHaz`: If I view the source in firefox, and click on the css file specification, it displays it fine but ignores the content. Copying the css file's content into my html file works fine.

19:54  hLVEHEART: Stupid question, can you declare an <!--[if IE]> within a stylesheet?
19:54  dravekx: no
19:54 * hLVEHEART sighs
19:54  hLVEHEART: :(
19:54  hLVEHEART: that sucks.
19:56  speak: hLVEHEART there are ways to apply IE specific CSS rules, but naturally they're all invalid
19:57  ronghail: is there a color for clear?  I want the form submit button to just be the color of what is behind it
19:58  hLVEHEART: speak, that sucks becuase rounded corners from jqueryui don't work 100% properly in IE... even with modernizr
19:58  hLVEHEART: so I was stuck using the PIE.htc fix to get them to display properly
19:59  hLVEHEART: Problem with that, is that PIE.htc code is a quite a bit of code to execute 100% of the time
19:59  hLVEHEART: :3
19:59  hLVEHEART: lose/lose situation.

20:03  nemo: hLVEHEART: why would you want to do that anyway? why not just keep your IE rules away from the others?
20:04  quest88: I have a div whose height takes up 100% of the page, which is what I want. I have a child div that I've set height and min-height to 100% yet it doesn't take up the remaining space. Any ideas why?

20:19  nemo: Engin: IE6 doesn't support alpha on PNG
20:19  Engin: this is IE8, and I don't support IE6
20:19  nemo: Engin: either use an indexed (256 colour PNG w/ a single bit transparency) png or else javascript fixes
20:19  nemo: ah
20:19  nemo: hm.
20:19  nemo: well. IE8 does have some alpha bugs too :)
20:19  quest88: hard to give you a test case as I'm using less.js for my css
20:19  nemo: quest88: ugh
20:19  nemo: all the more reason for a reduced testcase
20:20  nemo: quest88: oh. I hadn't looked at your pastebin. you mean the filter: alpha...
20:20  quest88: Engin: ^
20:21  nemo: Engin: ok. no prob. just change it to IE8 compat syntax
20:21  nemo: Engin: MS deprecated that one in IE8
20:21  Engin: huh ? I used that exact syntax on another div it worked
20:21  nemo: filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=50)
20:21  nemo: hm
20:21  nemo: I thought it was deprecated...

20:23  kappaluppa1: does anyone know if IE7 & IE8 have issues with class being added to <a tag?
20:24  kappaluppa1: I'm working on a site that uses jquery to add a class to an a href tag. the class shows up in FF, but does not show in IE
20:24  kvnn: kappaluppal : using addClass ?
20:25  kappaluppa1: yes
20:25  kvnn: if its not documented a jQuery, then it wouldn't be a bug. You are sure its not a cache thing?
20:26  kappaluppa1: I thought it might be but the code does not show the class at all in ie
20:27  kappaluppa1: <a href="/undergradschool/interests" class="modalframe-processed">Choose Interests</a>  in ff
20:28  kappaluppa1: <a href="/undergradschool/interests" >Choose Interests</a> in IE
20:32  goleif: kappaluppal: Is it even possible to see the changes jQuery make, in IE?
20:34  kappaluppa1: goleif no, that's why i was wondering - at first - if IE doesn't like a class on an a tag
20:34  goleif: kappaluppal: There should be no problems
20:34  goleif: ...theoretically.
20:35  goleif: kappaluppa1: Have you tried using a class name without a "-" in it?
20:36  kappaluppa1:  goleif no. i might have to give it a go. however - as is always the case two hours to launch and ie still looks like crap
20:37  goleif: kappaluppa1 that's why I don't give a crap about ie anymore.
20:37  kappaluppa1: goleif - me either. i wish my client felt the same way  :/  she may not have a choice! lol

20:42  Ugo-from-roofs: Hello! I have a problem:
20:44  fg-: have you ever had any issues in dealing with z-index for chrome, i can't make a div overlap an iframe
20:44  fg-: no matter what z-index i set to it, the iframe stays on top
20:44  rhelic: Ugo-from-roofs: don't ask to ask
20:46  Ugo-from-roofs: I'm making ePub book.
20:46  Ugo-from-roofs: And I need to solve objective:
20:46  Ugo-from-roofs: Bound picture with sign. And deny transfer sign to the next page.
20:46  Ugo-from-roofs: How I can do it?
20:47  Ugo-from-roofs: I've attempted merge picture & sign in div
20:47  Ugo-from-roofs: And declare "display: inline-block" in css
20:47  goleif: fg- Are you using "position" on both the div and the iframe? Because that is necessary when using z-index.
20:47  Ugo-from-roofs: Like it was written in apple manual.
20:47  Ugo-from-roofs: But it does't work(
20:47  fg-: goleif: hmm no, i'll add the position to the iframe
20:47  fg-: goleif: let me check that
20:48  goleif: fg- Maybe it won't work, but I read it a while ago, so it's worth a try...
20:50  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs: Do you have the possibility to show the problem?
20:52  fg-: goleif: it works
20:53  Ugo-from-roofs: goleif, it's difficult, because in html/css no need divide text to pages(
20:53  fg-: goleif: i tried it in a separate html page, i will now in the original one
20:53  goleif: fg- Good, good :)
20:54  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs I just have a hard time understanding your description of the problem
20:54  Bananobot: fg-: z-index only applies when position is non-static. It's common to simply set position:relative; in order to get z-index to work. Also, an element with position:relative will appear on top of an element with position:static even without a z-index
20:55  Ugo-from-roofs: Ok, I'll attempt figure it simplier. I'm sorry for my poor English.
20:56  Ugo-from-roofs: I have image: <p><img alt="" src="../Images/ris_st17.jpg" /></p>
20:57 --- ryanblair_ is now known as ryanblair
20:57  Ugo-from-roofs: And I have sign: <p>Description of image</p>
20:58  Ugo-from-roofs: And I have problem: When sign has no space on a page under image,
20:58 --- arumaniac is now known as i00nsu
20:59  Ugo-from-roofs: It transfers to next page
20:59 --- Azure|dc is now known as Azure
21:00  fg-: goleif: thanks a lot
21:00  Ugo-from-roofs: I need: Deny transferring sign.
21:00  goleif: fg- no problem!
21:00  fg-: goleif: if i add a position: relative to the div that contains my banner it works good, i should read a little more about position: static
21:00  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs: I just have to try to understand for a little moment! :D
21:01  Bananobot: fg-: "static" is what "position" defaults to
21:01  Bananobot: fg-: I you don't set any position, it will be static
21:01  fg-: Bananobot: i see, i thought the default was relative
21:01  fg-: but i was confused
21:01  Bananobot: fg-: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-position
21:02  Ugo-from-roofs: I need resize image, if for sign has no space beneath image on the page.
21:02  Ugo-from-roofs: ohh. it's difficult to explain(
21:03  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs: First, you shouldn't use <p> like that. <p> is only for normal text. Use <span> for short texts and <div> for miscellanous content
21:03  fg-: Bananobot: thank you
21:03  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs: Second, - are you sure it's not a javascript solution you need?
21:05  Ugo-from-roofs: goleif, I afraid, epub readers for iPad, Kindle, etc. don't understand javascript(
21:06  Ugo-from-roofs: I'm reading manual: EPUB Straight to the Point: Creating ebooks for the Apple iPad and other ereaders.
21:06  Ugo-from-roofs: "So, if you apply display: inline-block to a div, all of the contents of that div are treated as a unit, and are kept together on a page—as much as possible—often starting a new page in the process."
21:06  goleif: Ugo-from-roofs: Oh, sorry, I don't know anything about iPad stuff...
21:06  tw2113: i haven't tested yet, but i think chrome can read epub in browser
21:07  tw2113: at least with an extension
21:07  Ugo-from-roofs: tw2113, It can.
21:08  Ugo-from-roofs: But chrome don't divide ePub to the pages.
21:08  Ugo-from-roofs: But iPad do it(
21:14  dravekx: brain freeze.

21:26  qq99: how would I go about adding an underline effect to a header but keeping the header display only as wide as the text within it?
21:27  qq99: I was thinking inline with a border-bottom, but the margin-bottom collapses with the paragraphs below it
21:32  qq99: altenatively, is there a way to control how far text-decoration:underline is from the text?
21:32  goleif: qq99 Instead of inline, use display: block; float: left;
21:32  goleif: qq99 and possibly clear: both;
21:33  WierdAAR: I'm currently building a demo site, at http://demo.hyperbolic-space.com/. I am trying to get to two elements (the one with DLM and the navigation ) to be on the same "line". That is, first the DML, and then the navigation menu without a line break. I've tried several things, but can't get it to work. Stylesheet is at http://demo.hyperbolic-space.com/style.css with all failed attempts removed.
21:33  qq99: goleif, thanks :)
21:33  goleif: qq99: And no, you can't control the underline position.
21:33  goleif: 1199: No problem.
21:33  goleif: qq99*
21:33  goleif: qq99: Though, you can skip the underline and use a border-bottom instead
21:34  kappaluppa1: i know that with IE only rules in 31 style sheets are applied. and the first 4,095. That wouldn't happen to be 4,095 x 31, eh?
21:34  qq99: goleif, yeah, I'll go with float and border-bottom, but is there a way to make the following p's auto-clear without me explicitly adding a clearfix or adding clear:left/both to the p?
21:34  kappaluppa1: :p
21:36  qq99: next question, why would anyone use clip when they could do overflow:hidden and define a length & width?
21:36  qq99: or basically what is a use case for css clip property?
21:37  goleif: qq99: To understand your first question, I would probably need to see the layout to understand the problem.
21:37  goleif: Never heard of clip, though...

21:46  phantomcircuit: <div><p>sometext</p></div> how would i align the text vertically in the middle of the div?

21:48  Kunda: http://www.biodynamic-craniosacral.org/Resources
21:49  Kunda: In general it looks like this http://pastie.org/private/rlawxuapf1wzubduaf19lw hence the list redundant list icons
21:50  speak: phantomcircuit one trick that comes to mind is setting line-height to the height of the div, but that's relatively dirty and only works with single lines :P

21:57  silky: Kunda those roses are being set by the content property, not list-style-type
21:57 --- arumaniac is now known as i00nsu
21:57  silky: if you did, for example .entry ul li::before {content: '';} that would remove them
21:59  silky: content: "none"; should work too
21:59  Kunda: how do I add that as a tag to the page instead of using the .css file ?
22:01  silky: you could just throw it in some style tags but if you're trying to preserve a source css file just make another one and put your custom css in there
22:01  silky: and include that custom file in your document as well

22:11  silky: oh that sure does look nice
22:11  sullivan0: oh and not to mention css FUNCTIONS haha with default values for the arguments :D
22:12  silky: i just wish css had variable support
22:12  sullivan0: its very sweet... if you use it right you can do theming and base all values on ems etc, hold a single page for the 'theme variables' so you can swap colour schemes etc

22:36  bove: How can I get scrollbars on an element inside a fixed position div?

22:40 --- Sefyroth_ is now known as Sefyroth
22:40  temhawk: |Bboy|: use server-side content-negotiation to send the correct stylesheet, or include the ie-specific stylesheet in a conditional comment which should override the regular stylesheet

22:58  temhawk: or did I interrupt your question?
22:58  benallard: hmm, not in my case ... my child one is absolute positionned

22:58  temhawk: then, it's not possible afaik
