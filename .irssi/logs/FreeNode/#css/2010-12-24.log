01:08  _bogus_: is there anyway to keep a footer sticked to the bottom of the client (i mean the browser's window, not of the page) using only css ?
01:09  boogyman: ]css put bottom @ _bogus_
01:09  _ZofBot4: _bogus_, Put #foo to the bottom of #container: <div id="container"><p id="foo">lal</p></div>  #container{position: relative;} #foo{position: absolute; bottom: 0;} /* IE may need either `left` or `right` as well */
01:09  _bogus_: im using position: absolute; and bottom: 0px; but when you scroll the page, it doesn't keeps sticked to the bottom of the window
01:14  Cryophile: use fixed not absolute
01:19  dravekx: phicked
01:19  _bogus_: Cryophile that worked! thanks

03:14  wahnfrieden: hi
03:14  wahnfrieden: think it's possible to have a rounded trapezoid in CSS? sort of like chrome's tabs
03:15  azazul: with images
03:15  wahnfrieden: :-/
03:16  azazul: google : sliding doors
03:16  wahnfrieden: i can do it using "triangles" via borders
03:16  wahnfrieden: but those can't be rounded
03:17  ekkis: anyone around that has used cursor: url() successfully before?
03:17  wahnfrieden: thanks azazul, but the left/right sides of the "tab" need to be angled. but yea I'll just need to use images
03:17  ekkis: I seem to have an issue with the Transitional doctype
03:18  ekkis: it seems like if I use a Doctype at all, that functionality doesn't work (in Chrome)
03:22  ekkis: anyone with a clue?
03:27  azazul: 'doctype
03:27  azazul: bot is down again
03:27  azazul: dont ever use transitional doctyp

04:30  wahnfrieden: have 2 divs flanking the tab title div. set a rounded corner to the bottom left/right, and do -moz-transform: skewX(10deg)
