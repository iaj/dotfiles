00:09  Inazad: hi
00:09  crackguy: nemo, placing box2 before box1 solved the problem
00:09  Inazad: If i have a border-bottom, how to add a padding to get it lower ?
00:09  nemo: crackguy: that won't fix the height problem though :-p
00:10  nemo: that'll need the nesting approach
00:10 --- Channel #css was synced in 111 seconds
00:10  nemo: Inazad: by lower, I take it you mean you want like whitespace or something between the edge of the box, and the border?
00:10  nemo: Inazad: depending on what you want and what your box looks like, you can probably literally just use padding...
00:11  Inazad: nemo, yeah a little bit
00:11  nemo: otherwise, you might need CSS3 multiple borders, or nested boxes CSS2 workaround (needed if the styling must look same in IE)
00:11 --- MonsterKiller is now known as monsterkiller
00:11  Inazad: padding ? how to apply padding on a border ?
00:11  nemo: Inazad: padding on the box, not the border
00:12  nemo: Inazad: if you need something like, say, a lined box, whitespace then a border
00:13  nemo: you will need either multiple border support or nested boxes
00:13  coachz: what is the correct way to specify that any  element.style { z-index: 1002; }    in my #mydiv  should have z-index: 2000;
00:14  nemo: Inazad: hm. could probably also use box-shadow, but that requires CSS3 as well
00:14  coachz: in firebug i don't see a # or .  in front of  element.style either does that mean element.style is for any element ?
00:14  nemo: coachz: I'm not aware of any selector that does what you want, but I have to wonder about a design that would inspire this request
00:15  nemo: the style attribute can be applied to any element yes
00:15  coachz: element.style is overriding my z-index
00:15  coachz: so i'm need to override it
00:15  nemo: yes. element.style is bad bad
00:15  coachz: for my dialog box
00:15  nemo: oh. element.style
00:15  nemo: as in the attribute. that you *can* override, but it is not CSS compatible
00:15  coachz: how would i override it for #mydiv ?
00:15  nemo: er
00:16  nemo: IE compatible
00:16  nemo: coachz: just use !important if you can. that will work in IE
00:16  nemo: otherwise... http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors
00:16  coachz: how do i do that for only my div
00:17  nemo: #mydiv { z-index: 2000 !important; }
00:17  coachz: i tried that and element.style is overriding that
00:17  nemo: doesn't override !important
00:17  coachz: ok, i'll try it again now

01:16  phpAdam: in the page

01:16  phpAdam: got ideas?
01:16  phpAdam: (easy)
01:16  KenBW2: asfahaan: "chop an image into html", "for some reason the image is breaking"
01:16  KenBW2: lol
01:17  asfahaan: lol
01:17  asfahaan: hey man i meant sumthing else
01:17  oksushi: asfahaan: do not use fireworks to generate html
01:17  asfahaan: anyways u can see what i mean here
01:17  asfahaan: http://www.waha.co.nz/clients/kwa/takepu.html
01:18  KenBW2: phpAdam: <div style="clear:left; height:1px"></div> under the <img /> tag
01:18  oksushi: KenBW2: …
01:18  asfahaan: well how should i  make the read more and play video as links in that image ?
01:18  oksushi: asfahaan: create correct html, then use absolute positioning
01:18  oksushi: not tables for layout, like you have now
01:18  oksushi: phpAdam: http://colinaarts.com/articles/float-containment/

01:19  asfahaan: ta
01:20  phpAdam: its as if the box cant hold my picture and would use its own height
01:20  KenBW2: phpAdam: that would be correct
01:20  oksushi: phpAdam: read the link I gave you, dawg
01:20  phpAdam: oki
01:20  KenBW2: phpAdam: when you float an element it no longer counts in the layout
01:20  oksushi: KenBW2: if you advocate a 'clearer div' you should read it as well
01:21  KenBW2: oksushi: i know its nasty, i wouldnt use it in anything i use
01:21  oksushi: then why tell others to use it?
01:21  KenBW2: oksushi: i was highlighting the CSS that is to be used
01:21  KenBW2: the HTML wasnt really what  was trying to portray
01:23  KenBW2: phpAdam: i just now looked at your HTML - are they inline styles? :O

01:26  KenBW2: asfahaan: that HTML is so bad i wont even begin to explain why its so liable to break
01:27  asfahaan: fair enough. can you please suggest what approach should i be taking if i want to make the Read More and Play Video as links to open up a fancybox

01:29  JoeNeedsHelp: Ya
01:29  KenBW2: the div or ul?
01:30  JoeNeedsHelp: Btw oksushi, I really appreciate all the sound advice you've given me until this point.
01:30  asfahaan: can you please suggest what approach should i be taking if i want to make the Read More and Play Video as links to open up a fancybox. - > https://skitch.com/asfahaan/rky7u/takepu-chart
01:30  KenBW2: JoeHazzers: the links are there for me, what browser?
01:31  KenBW2: asfahaan: http://fancybox.net/howto start by reading this
01:31  oksushi: asfahaan: not a css question
01:32  oksushi: JoeNeedsHelp: sure, np
01:32  JoeNeedsHelp: any idea what's causing that?
01:33  oksushi: JoeNeedsHelp: I don’t see the issue
01:34  JoeNeedsHelp: There's subtabs in the light blue bar that aren't showing up when position relative is applied
01:34  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: what browser are you seeing the problem in
01:35  oksushi: JoeNeedsHelp: ensure #navbar .navTabs {} has adequate z-index
01:35  JoeNeedsHelp: chrome, firefox and ie
01:35 --- nemesis is now known as Guest12145
01:36  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: any reason why youre using position:relative?
01:36  JoeNeedsHelp: I added z-index of 2 but still nothing
01:36  JoeNeedsHelp: ya, I'm going to position some links pretty soon relative to that navbar.
01:37  JoeNeedsHelp: Haven't gotten to it yet being that the issue I'm having
01:37  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: i can see the a using Firebug
01:38  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: but not the text
01:39  KenBW2: aha
01:39  JoeNeedsHelp: weird
01:39  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: i think ive got it
01:39  JoeNeedsHelp: Awesome!
01:39  phpAdam: thanks guys
01:39  mikeric: is there any way to draw a canvas element as a background in firefox 3.x? (like -webkit-canvas(n))
01:40  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: on ul.navTabs you have position:absolute, but you havent specified top or left, so it's hiding behind the top level nav
01:45  JoeNeedsHelp: Oh I didn't want to specify top to keep it in it's current height.
01:45  JoeNeedsHelp: How would I go about doing it so it retains its current height?
01:45  JoeNeedsHelp: Or will that just be trial and error?
01:45  JoeNeedsHelp: I applied a top position
01:45  JoeNeedsHelp: But it hides behind when I apply it
01:45 --- richardwh1uk is now known as richardwhiuk
01:46  KenBW2: i think position:relative is the wrong way to go about it to be honest
01:47  JoeNeedsHelp: I just wanted to add some more links but have them on the right side as oppose to the left.
01:47  JoeNeedsHelp: Did that make sense?
01:47  JoeNeedsHelp: But when I do a float right on the li, it doesn't move.
01:47  JoeNeedsHelp: So I thought to use position absolute and place a position relative on the navbar
01:48  JoeNeedsHelp: To achieve that goal
01:49  KenBW2: no you want float:right on the ul
01:50  JoeNeedsHelp: No that's not what I mean
01:50  JoeNeedsHelp: I would like to keep the ul that's already there fixed where it is
01:50  JoeNeedsHelp: And position a few li's to the far right out of it.
01:50  KenBW2: you mean ul#navbar or ul.navTabs?
01:50  JoeNeedsHelp: neither. I would give a few li's class names
01:51  JoeNeedsHelp: And position them to the right
01:51  JoeNeedsHelp: Well I guess li's of ul.navTabs yes
01:51  JoeNeedsHelp: But not the whole thing
01:51  JoeNeedsHelp: Just a few of them
01:52  KenBW2: in that case stick to your position :relative thing, but only apply it to the ones you want to move to the right
01:52  JoeNeedsHelp: right i was doing that
01:53  JoeNeedsHelp: But, the problem is when I apply the top like you suggested, they're getting hidden behind
01:53  KenBW2: make the change and ill reload
01:54  JoeNeedsHelp: I made the change
01:55  KenBW2: JoeNeedsHelp: you have position:absolute on ul.navTabs
01:55  JoeNeedsHelp: Right I have too
01:55  KenBW2: you only want to do it on the li's you want to align to the right
01:56  JoeNeedsHelp: Oh I didn't do that yet. I'm still trying to work out the issue with it hiding the current links when position relative is applied to the navbar
01:56  JoeNeedsHelp: Once that's sorted, I can take it from there
01:56  KenBW2: right
01:57  KenBW2: ok it looks like it's because of your padding-bottom on #navigation div
01:57  KenBW2: 2.72em
01:57  JoeNeedsHelp: Do you suggest an alternative for that?
01:58  KenBW2: remove that padding and give it a height
01:58  JoeNeedsHelp: When I applied height, it was so variable between browsers
01:58  KenBW2: try using px instead of em
01:58  JoeNeedsHelp: k
01:58  em: orly?
01:58  KenBW2: back in a bit
01:58  KenBW2: em: rly

03:26  oojacoboo: ]testcase @ Announcement
03:26  _ZofBot4: Announcement, testcase: a single page (or set of pages) that describes and isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styles, and scripting
03:27  Announcement: the first one would be extra hard for css, but relatively easy for javascript, so i assume thats what they used
03:27  oojacoboo: Announcement: are you hard of hearing?
03:27  zulax: how would I have so that the current active link have different css class than the others?
03:27  oksushi: zulax: with your preferred scripting language.
03:27  Announcement: awesome
03:27  Announcement: AWESOME I GOTA AN IDEA
03:27  oojacoboo: zulax: or you could indicate within that specific page in the markup
03:28  zulax: hmm...then looks like javascript job then :(
03:28  oojacoboo: zulax: I like to inject the name of the page into the <body> tag, and then I can target whatever I need based on that page
03:28  oojacoboo: <body class="home">
03:29  oojacoboo: from there, you can do something like...
03:29  oojacoboo: body.home ul#main-menu li.home a  {text-decoration: underline;}
03:29  oojacoboo: or whatever you like
03:30  zulax: interesting, let me wrap my head around that
03:31  zulax: oojacoboo, are body.home and li.home the same home?
03:32  oojacoboo: umm, yes/no ?
03:32  oojacoboo: that question doesn't make sense
03:32  oojacoboo: same class, two different elements
03:33  oojacoboo: you could name them anything you wanted though
03:33  Announcement: li is inside body
03:33  oojacoboo: body.homepage ... li.home
03:33  Announcement: (both home)
03:34  zulax: oojacoboo, if you did <body class="home">, how about other links like "contact"
03:34  oojacoboo: zulax: you could do body.home ul#main-menu li.contact {
03:34  oojacoboo: sure, but you wouldn't want to, presumably
03:35  oojacoboo: the point is to say, when I am on the homepage, I want the main menu item for home to be styled as such
03:35  oojacoboo: the above example would be styling up a contact page, or something
03:35  zulax: ah, ok
03:35  oojacoboo: when you have set class="home" for the body
03:35  oojacoboo: you would presumably use body class="contact" in that case
03:35  zulax: i was thinking smthg like that did the underline for whatever active page we on
03:36  oojacoboo: but there could be reasons to do otherwise, just depednds
03:36  oojacoboo: zulax: that's exacltly what my first example was
03:36 * zulax is confused
03:36  oojacoboo: zulax: link
03:37  zulax: does you technique only style the link for home page, or any active page?
03:37  oojacoboo: zulax: there is no way of targeting what the active page is like you are thinking
03:37  oojacoboo: it's a bit more manual
03:37  oojacoboo: I'm telling you my preferred method
03:37  zulax: ok
03:38  oojacoboo: zulax: http://dev.rentpost.com
03:38  oojacoboo: please look at the code here to see how I did it
03:38  zulax: yup that works
03:38  oojacoboo: yea, so look at the code and learn
03:39  zulax: oojacoboo, so do you have 5 individual php pages for Managers, Tenants...
03:39  oojacoboo: I do
03:40  oojacoboo: I use a php framework though, and there is a header/footer template
03:40  zulax: because, while using CMS and frameworks, its not necessary to duplicate the templates
03:40  zulax: thats right
03:40  oojacoboo: I then pass a php variable through each page that is then processed in the template and added to the body tag
03:40  zulax: ok, that works
03:41  zulax: i knew php would do it , but I would prefer javascript unless there was a css way of doing it
03:41  oojacoboo: zulax: you could use js I guess, but I don't know why you would want to
03:42  oojacoboo: zulax: <?php slot('pageNick', 'about'); ?>
03:42  oojacoboo: I use something like that
03:42  oojacoboo: and 	<body <?php if(has_slot('pageNick')) echo 'id="'.get_slot("pageNick").'"' ?>>
03:42  zulax: looks like i will use something like that
03:42  zulax: thanks for you time bud

04:32  lukus: I'm fade from a variable background oojacoboo
04:32  lukus: *fading
04:32  lukus: it's for a modal window with a dropshadow

04:34  oojacoboo: lukus: you can add lots of filters to elements, I'd need to see the specific example to be able to tell you the best method
04:35  oojacoboo: etcetera: div * {font-weight: bold;}
04:35  etcetera: oojacoboo: thanks
04:35  CoJaBo: oojacoboo: I'm using swype
04:35  oojacoboo: etcetera: although, I would bet that's not what you want
04:35  oojacoboo: even though that's what you asked for
04:35  etcetera: oojacoboo: why's that?
04:36  etcetera: you mean I want to only make all text elements bold?
04:36  oojacoboo: just would be willing to bet on it
04:36  oojacoboo: that would make all ELEMENTS within a div bold
04:36  oojacoboo: and all divs too
04:37  etcetera: oojacoboo: so it's better to just explicitly set things like p, h1, h2...

04:42  Announcement: a element is worth 1 point, class is 10, id is 100, if they r  equal whichever is last is priority

04:43  etcetera: jedimind_: thanks.
04:43  jedimind_: oojacoboo, i said it nicely :)
04:43  oojacoboo: jedimind_: I've had enough ;)
04:43  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: can I msg you a link?
04:44  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: if you must
04:44  etcetera: jedimind_: so how can I increase the specificity for a label.
04:44  Forbidd3n: thanks
04:44  Forbidd3n: if you hover over second item
04:44  jedimind_: etcetera, read the link i gave you to understand what i meant
04:45  etcetera: jedimind_: right.
04:45  etcetera: I understand what the link is saying.
04:45  jedimind_: you dont, otherwise you wouldnt have asked the question you asked :)
04:45  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: #nav li a:hover  -- should be -- #nav li:hover a
04:45  jedimind_: you cannot "increase specificity" of an html element
04:45  oojacoboo: !important
04:46  jedimind_: im not trying to be a hardass
04:46  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: use important as well
04:46  etcetera: jedimind_: ok, I'll read all the way through then ;-)
04:46  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: no!
04:46  Forbidd3n: oh sorry
04:46  oojacoboo: that was to jedimind_
04:47  jedimind_: oojacoboo, im aware of what important does, but im not sure thats' what he needs or what he's trying to do
04:47  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: now the child is taking the parent class
04:47  jedimind_: his question is somewhat arbitrary and nonsensical
04:47  oojacoboo: jedimind_: yea, I don't really know
04:47  jedimind_: so id rather figure out what he wants first before giving advice :)
04:47  oojacoboo: wasn't looking at his case
04:47  jedimind_: yeah
04:47  jedimind_: s'all good
04:47  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: msg me link again
04:48  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: you need to specify the top level menu from the secondary
04:48  Forbidd3n: I have - #nav ul
04:48  oojacoboo: you'll want to override the child
04:49  oojacoboo: #nav ul li ul li {
04:49  oojacoboo: or you will want to assign it a class itself
04:49  oojacoboo: then override the styles you are setting on the parent
04:49  Forbidd3n: so #nav li ul li {
04:49  oojacoboo: yes
04:50  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: no luck
04:51  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: you don't want the white background?
04:51  Forbidd3n: i want the white, not the one with the top border
04:51  oojacoboo: ok
04:52  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: this is a mess
04:52  Forbidd3n: It appears that this - #nav li:hover a - is superceding this - #nav ul li
04:52  oojacoboo: you don't need to assign all your styles on :hover
04:53  oojacoboo: instead, assign the styles to the element, then just display: block; or display: list-item; on :hover
04:53  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: not sure I follow that concept
04:53  oojacoboo: much easier to manage and debug like that
04:54  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: design it so it's all visible the way you want, then ping me
04:54  oojacoboo: no :hover
04:54  oojacoboo: remove it all
04:54  Forbidd3n: ok, minus the rollovers
04:54  Forbidd3n: ok
05:01  rainabba: I'm dealing with a page which has a margin ~25px' on the right edge causing horizontal scrolling. Using various hilight functions in FireBug or IE devtools, I've been unable to determine what element is causing it. before that I reviewed the code but nothing stuck out at me. Any other tricks out there to find out what's causing this?
05:02  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: I need the main menu item styled like it is active as well
05:02  oojacoboo: or, you can just leave both pieces there
05:02  rainabba: When I "Inspect Element", I get <html>, not even <body> which surprises me.
05:02  oojacoboo: and add the :hover bit to it now
05:03  oojacoboo: rainabba: link?
05:03  rainabba: Intranet app :(
05:03  oojacoboo: sounds like you are SOL
05:03  rainabba: Sounds like you're pretty worthless, but thanks for the notification.
05:03  Forbidd3n: add the hover state as static
05:03  oojacoboo: either way, go ahead and make it a live :hover Forbidd3n
05:04  Forbidd3n: on the li:
05:05  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: the hover is there on the parent now
05:05  Forbidd3n: still goes to the child now
05:06  oojacoboo: k
05:08  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: any luck with helping me
05:09  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: #nav li:hover ul li a {background: none; border: none; padding-top: 4px;}
05:09  oojacoboo: add that AFTER the :hover on the parent
05:10  Forbidd3n: now to only show subnav on hover
05:11  oojacoboo: #nav li ul {display: none;} #nav li:hover ul {display: block}
05:13  Forbidd3n: oojacoboo: I am using this to set a hover on the subnav
05:13  Forbidd3n: #nav ul li:hover a, #nav ul li a.active {background:#F1F5BA;}
05:13  Forbidd3n: not working though
05:13  Forbidd3n: thank you btw for the help
05:14  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: ok?
05:14  oojacoboo: link me again
05:15  oojacoboo: Forbidd3n: add li:hover before that ul in that statement for each one, or !important after the #F1F5BA
05:16  Forbidd3n: the height is messed up on it with !important
05:17  oojacoboo: do you have something else being set in that statement other than the background?
05:17  Forbidd3n: no
05:17  Forbidd3n: well I just added height
05:17  oojacoboo: I have a feeling you can figure this one out from here ;)
05:17  Forbidd3n: nothing now
05:17  Forbidd3n: ok thanks
05:18  Ellement: i cant seem to disinherit opacity selector, my child element keeps inheriting its parent opacity value

05:28  oojacoboo: but I appreciate the advice
05:29  rainabba: I'm sure you have, but hanging out on IRC, trolling, and otherwise acting like a spoiled brat is far more appealing.

05:31  oojacoboo: somehow, deep down, that gives me joy
05:31  rainabba: Amazing how one little command can make the world a slightly better place by filtering out worthless chatter :)
05:33  cspray_in_ny: rainabba, i've routinely been amazed by how much one little comma can do
05:36  rainabba: cspray_in_ny: I'm guessing that's a reference to something that I've missed because I'm not sure what comma you'd be referring to.
05:37  cspray_in_ny: sorry, i guess i was too ambiguous...i was commenting on your comment about one little command
05:37  cspray_in_ny: i think if could have put some tone or inflection behind it it would have made more sense...but alas
05:38  rainabba: gotta love the toneless communication of chat :)
05:40  cspray_in_ny: indeed
06:02  rainabba: Not exactly elegant, but I found a method to resolve my issue. I used Chrome (though FF would like have been good too) and exploded the DOM view. Then from the inside I began to deleted nodes and watch for the issue to resolve. Eventually it did and I knew exactly which node was causing the problem which quickly led to me seeing the cause.
06:03  rainabba: ajpiano: Hey!
06:11  jtascher: Could anyone tell my the two pages here: http://pastebin.com/SmuhvJY2 are giving different widths to div.fright (the div around the content images/captions)?  I don't see why the first one (conduit) is getting a width of 505px
06:15  oojacoboo: jtascher: it's b/c the text is long within that container
06:15  oojacoboo: div is going to size itself to the max width
06:15  jtascher: oh so the text container needs a width
06:15  jtascher: i see
06:16  jtascher: i believe its a span so i either got to make it block or change it to a p tag
06:16  oojacoboo: yea, either the span tag does or the div
06:16  jtascher: ok thanks
06:16  oojacoboo: thank rainabba

06:56  dravekx: show respect to Paul Cézanne. he was a french homo with feelings.
06:58  oksushi: aaroninfidel: no, there is no :contains
06:58  oksushi: why we don’t have a parent selector: http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors
07:01  aaroninfidel: oksushi: can you explain why you would use > ?
07:04  aaroninfidel: can someone explain to me how I can achieve the following? I want to indent my text a little bit to the left its inside of a list, but I'd like the background of the LIs to span 100% of the page some LIs contain A tags.
07:08  oksushi: why I would?
07:08  oksushi: aaroninfidel: give them a class
07:10  dravekx: what are the px dimensions of a 14MP image?
07:10  dravekx: 4096x3072? no. thats 12MP. hmmm.
07:13  aaroninfidel: oksushi: I have no idea why I would ever use > when creating CSS so I guess I was just looking for some insight.
07:16  oksushi: aaroninfidel: if you need to select a child instead of a decendant
07:17  oksushi: or are you asking something else?
07:17  JDigital: Do I have to escape apostrophes inside <title> tags?
07:17  JDigital: if I want to make a page called "JDigital's Website", say
07:17  aaroninfidel: well, if I wanted to select a child couldn't I just call it like .parent .child ?
07:17  oksushi: ’ should be fine in there
07:18  oksushi: aaroninfidel: yes, but that would also select .parent div div div div .child
07:18  oksushi: for example, which you may not want
07:18  dravekx: I saw Jesus using tables.
07:18  aaroninfidel: so if I do .parent > .child it would skip over the extra?
07:18  aaroninfidel: and just be applied to .child
07:18  aaroninfidel: ?
07:19  oksushi: aaroninfidel: that would select <div class="parent"><div class="child"> but not <div class="parent"><div><div class="child">
07:19  aaroninfidel: I see.
07:19  aaroninfidel: thank you :)
07:19  oksushi: it selects a CHILD not a DESCENDANT
07:19  oksushi: a child is a specific descendant though :)

11:07  krambiorix: ok, i know that all that doesn't work with IE but i'm looking for something that actually DOES work
11:07  oksushi: because you have overflow: hidden on .main-desc li

13:00  linelevel: Hi, I'm having a tough problem: I have a DIV with position:absolute followed by another DIV, which I want to appear below it. Instead, the 2nd DIV is overlapping the top of the first DIV.  I tried clear:both on the 2nd div, but that's not working (since, as I've learned, that only works to clear elements with the float property set)
13:00  linelevel: Any suggestions?
13:01  linelevel: The first DIV is of variable height, so I can't absolutely position the 2nd DIV
13:01  oksushi: linelevel: the nature of absolutely positioned elements is that they are /removed/ from the document flow
13:02  oksushi: they will not effect anything else on the page
13:02  linelevel: oksushi: Yes, I've learned that. So how can I make something else appear below it?
13:02  oksushi: by not making it position: absolute;
13:02  linelevel: :/
13:02  linelevel: ok, thanks then
13:03  oksushi: perhaps a good solution would be to wra the two elements in an absolutely-positioned container, and let the elements inside it behave normally?
13:03  oksushi: *wrap
13:03  linelevel: oksushi: Actually, the 1st DIV is not position:absolute, it is position:relative, but contains DIVs that are position:absolute
13:03  oksushi: sure, well there is no way to get the parent to adjust height to contain the abs positioned children
13:05  linelevel: hmm, I may see a solution. Is it possible to have a DIV which is float:left but which contains abs. positioned children (positioned relative to the floating div)?
13:05  oksushi: yes
13:05  linelevel: Can I make a DIV   float:left (so it floats)   and make it   position:relative  (so abs. positioned children will be relative to it)?
13:06  oksushi: yes

14:10  Absolute0: On windows my textarea appears to fill up the entire div that contains it and on linux the width is about 70%. I have checked opera and firefox on both platforms. Is it possible to set the width of the textarea to 100% of the div? i tried textarea {width:100%;} but that didnt do anything.
14:11  Absolute0: sorry the other way around, not that it matters. (windows 100%, linux 70%)

14:34  krambiorix: i have a body with background image that is centered. When i resize my browser window, the background image is pushed to the left and is not viewable anymore... Anyone?
14:38  linelevel: Another quick question:  I have two divs side-by-side; the left one contains a variable-width image, and I need the right one to expand to fill the left-over space.  Naturally, I did this by making the left one float:left. But here's the catch: The right DIV will be taller than the left one, and I want it to maintain its left edge position (i.e., not spill under the left DIV). Is this possible to accomplish?
14:39  linelevel: I can't use   margin-left   because the margin depends on the width of the image in the left-hand DIV
14:42  Lazylegs: linelevel, give the right div property overflow: hidden or overflow: visible ( if no need to overflow stuff out of it)
14:43  Lazylegs: krambiorix, url or testcase?
14:44  Lazylegs: ah, he left already

14:46  linelevel: Lazylegs: Don't see how that will work. The right DIV will overlap the floating DIV
14:48  Lazylegs: linelevel, will or needs to?
14:48  linelevel: Lazylegs: will. I'd rather it didn't, but I'm not sure how to accomplish that without setting a margin equal to the  width of the left DIV (which I can't do, since the width of the left DIV is variable)
14:49  Lazylegs: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0u <-- linelevel, alter the width of #left to try out
14:51  Lazylegs: linelevel, http://colinaarts.com/articles/the-magic-of-overflow-hidden/ it's a kind of magic :)
14:56  Evet: is it possible to make font-size scale automatically?
14:56  linelevel: Lazylegs: That is awesome. You are awesome. :)
14:57  linelevel: I would have thought that would just hide the text. Does it work that way across all browsers?
14:57  Lazylegs: linelevel, down to ie6

15:54  Vaerros: krambiorix, link?
15:54  lutherross3: thank you i will see what i can work up
15:54  krambiorix: Vaerros, it's not online but this is my css http://pastebin.com/YEfsTvAU
15:55  Vaerros: lutherross3, np
15:56  krambiorix: Vaerros, do you understand my problem?
15:56  Vaerros: krambiorix, can't say I do :
15:58  krambiorix: when i make my browser window smaller, from right to left. My background is moving to the left, but it's on the left side out of sight
16:00  krambiorix: Vaerros, so the bg image is centered and when i resize the window the image stays centered but the left side of the image is out of the browser window (invisible)
16:00  zigzapca: Good morning
16:01  treebeen: krambiorix: the browser is not going to resize it so it's clipped?
16:03  krambiorix: hmm i don't know what 'clipped' mean, but half of the image is no moved to the left outside the browser window. it can move to the left but only till the border of the window
16:03  zigzapca: Hey im working on a website for a client at http://dianamotofoundation.org/index.html the logo on the left is still moving when i change the size of my browser window what should i set it as to keep it positioned and not break the navbar?
16:03  zigzapca: Anyone have a second to help me out?
16:04  krambiorix: treebeen, Vaerros , this guy has the same problem : http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/help/viewtopic.php?p=44996
16:05  krambiorix: damn, treebeen Vaerros i found it!
16:06  krambiorix: but my hyperlinks are gone in IE
16:07  Lazylegs: zigzapca, the tagline moves cause you have set it absolute from right.. so when you resize the page, the right edge moves
16:09  zigzapca: Lazylegs: what should i change it too? if i change it to fixed then it makes the logo do the same thing
16:10  Lazylegs: zigzapca, set the position from left not right.. or do not use positioning at all
16:10  zigzapca: Lazylegs: Oh i gotchya
16:10  zigzapca: thanks
16:11  Lazylegs: I might disconnect any moment now (sitting in train) so hopefully my solution works :)
16:11  zigzapca: Lazylegs: Awesome yeah that worked thanks =)
16:11  zigzapca: lazylegs: why did it have to be from the left and not the right?
16:12  zigzapca: If you havnt disconnected yet lol
16:16  Dartfall: Guys, are my colors too "sharp"? http://92.80.206.73/blog.php
16:16  systemfault: They're fine imho.
16:16  treebeen: zigzapca: because if you have it from the right it will position objects taking the right side as root
16:17  PrgmrBill: Dartfall: title color is hard to read, but that's it
16:17  systemfault: The font for the text is very bad though but fine for the titles
16:17  zigzapca: treebeen: Oh i see thanks
16:17  PrgmrBill: and the icons on the side being faded make me think they're disabled, not navigation
16:17  PrgmrBill: pretty confusing imo
16:18  treebeen: green computing! ;)
16:19  zigzapca: Dartfall: I like the green but the buttons and title need to pop some more maybe a white outline or dark outline
16:19  zigzapca: Green is a wonderful color =p
16:20  Dartfall: zigzapca, green is the only color :D
16:20  Dartfall: PrgmrBill, I know. It's still a WIP
16:20  zigzapca: treebeen: how do i make it so both the logo and tagline stay centered everything else when changing browser sides now?
16:20  PrgmrBill: Dartfall: duh :P

16:23  systemfault: I'm not sure that's what you want.
16:23  kaylee_work: well, our stuff has a custom template that builds all the header and menu wrap around crap..... but I need a bunch of stuff specifically for the content of this one page

16:26  airco: the rates yes
16:26  kaylee_work: because you have the contents of some cells wrapped in a <p>
16:26  kaylee_work: ?
16:27  kaylee_work: and your p style has a bottom margin of 15px
16:27  kaylee_work: you could align all the cells to the top, or you could take the margin off to get things to line up

16:29  treebeen: zigzapca: don't use absolute positioning
16:29  zigzapca: treebeen: what should i change them too?
16:31  treebeen: zigzapca: just remove the position attribute
16:32  treebeen: zigzapca: and make the crap float
16:32  treebeen: jk
16:32  zigzapca: treebeen: it breaks the navbar and pushes it way down and moves the taglines under the logo
16:32  zigzapca: lol
16:33  zigzapca: Let me try somethin real quick
16:33  treebeen: float: left;
16:33  treebeen: for the logo
16:34  zigzapca: ok i was gunna say it still pushes the navbar down
16:34  zigzapca: but that repositions them correctly
16:34  treebeen: float: right;  for the tagline
16:36  zigzapca: treebeen: awesome thanks now i just have to reposition the navbar and im good
16:36  zigzapca: =)

16:47  doberman: Just interested, which css reset do you usually use ?
16:48  HangoverMauriceJ: etcetera: If you don't mind donig something lame then just put an inline style in the HTML element of your choice.
16:49  HangoverMauriceJ: That information is based off of you saying you an't change the CSS file.
16:49  ridethefire122: WHERE IS OKSUSHI?
16:50  etcetera: HangoverMauriceJ: the css is applied dynamically at document load.
16:50  etcetera: inline styling isnt possible.
16:50  etcetera: i just did .center-label label { ... } and encapsulated the label in a div.

16:57  halcyon1234: Vanishing elements. That's not good. :|  Thanks, didn't think of that.
16:57  nemo: halcyon1234: are you doing this due to the IE z-index bug?

16:58 --- Hutch[S] is now known as Hutch[S]|away
16:58  nemo: 'cause... I'm not clear why you can't easily write a target like
16:58  nemo: * { z-index: 10; }
16:58  nemo: then target the ones you care about to z-index: 1;
16:58  nemo: or #main * { z-index: 10; }
16:58  nemo: or whatever
16:59  halcyon1234: nemo: I didn't know of that bug. It could be. The main issue is I don't have access to all the html controls that are already in use, and they don't set z-index at all. Can I do something like this:
17:00  halcyon1234: <div background z-index:0 position absolute>Background stuff</div>  <div all_existing_stuff_wrapper z-index:10>All existing stuff</div>
17:00  nemo: halcyon1234: er...
17:00  nemo: halcyon1234: I'm a little puzzled what the heck you are trying to do there TBH
17:01  nemo: halcyon1234: often using position absolute on base elements is a strong indication someone is doing something very wrong
