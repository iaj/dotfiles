08:53  WierdAAR: MauriceJ, Where is oksushi's magic library mind when you need it...
08:54  MauriceJ: WierdAAR: Amen, hehe.  I saw him sign-off a few hours ago.
08:54  WierdAAR: MauriceJ,  Hehe.. Must try to catch him sometime. He could properly point me to an article or two.
08:54  Lazylegs: racar>, you have url?
08:54  MauriceJ: AMcBain: Yep.
08:55  MauriceJ: WierdAAR: If you just had your client in here and read up the buffer you'd have a barrel full of great links and information.
08:55 --- Channel #css was synced in 116 seconds
08:55  racar: Lazylegs, i'm working on it ( webdevout test-case )
08:56  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, to get site working at ie7 should be stroll in a park. to get it working with ie6 needs usually something to be fixed. but pixel perfect results in all at the same time is pretty much impossible
08:56  WierdAAR: MauriceJ, Not a bad idea. I have a couple of things to do to day and I think I'll just leave it open.
08:56  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, but ie7 can require tricks
08:56  MauriceJ: WierdAAR: Yeah this channel has helped me a lot just by that method.
08:57  WierdAAR: Lazylegs, Ok. I think I'm going to have to install a virtual box with all the browser, and just go through them one by one.
08:57  AMcBain: ... there is IETester ...
08:58  WierdAAR: IETester?
08:58 * MauriceJ repeats that.
08:58  AMcBain: Yeah. It's a Windows app that will test IE5.5 through 9, if you have 9, otherwise up to 8.
08:58  AMcBain: (as most have 8)
08:58  MauriceJ: http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage
08:58  WierdAAR: AMcBain, Intriguing... A virtual box with IETester and the others then..
08:59  WierdAAR: Thanks for that!
08:59  AMcBain: It's faster than waiting for browsershots, and more interactive than the one IE-only renderer I found on the web.

09:00 --- curt`off is now known as Curt`
09:00  racar: if you remove the div id="description" and the height in the #middle ... you will see , its "moving" , its not center at the same place.
09:01  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, read earlier conversation.. if you do work for ie6.. :hover works only for anchor elements (<a>), then theres things to remember with z-index (ie6 and ie7) that act differently compared to other browsers.. but best method is.. do it, test it, fix it :)
09:01  AMcBain: racar, well, even if you remove the height from #middle you can see it since you've given it a top+relative position ...
09:01  AMcBain: So it's offset is fixed despite the container.
09:02  WierdAAR: Lazylegs, I think I'm only using :hover and not z-index. But I'll look it all through tonight and.. yeah.. do it, test it, fix it.
09:03  Lazylegs: AMcBain, no.. it offsets from it's original position
09:03  MauriceJ: WierdAAR: This site is full of good information: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html
09:03  racar: AMcBain, true , but wait on my website , its not moving if i remove only the height
09:03  AMcBain: racar, it doesn't move here iether.
09:03  AMcBain: either*
09:03  AMcBain: If you want it always centered, you don't want a fixed position offset.
09:04  AMcBain: ]vertical centering
09:04  AMcBain: ]middle @ racar
09:04  _ZofBot4: racar, middle: www.zoffix.com/zoffix/css/vertcenter.shtml , www.phrogz.net/css/valign_in_body/content.html , www.reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/ , www.wpdfd.com/editorial/thebox/deadcentre4.html
09:04  WierdAAR: MauriceJ, Great link.. Thanks
09:04  racar: AMcBain, hahaha damn i'm stupid ... the reason why its "moving" its a got the "vertical scroll-bar" hhahahaha
09:04  AMcBain: oh. that.
09:04  racar: :/
09:05 --- Curt` is now known as curt`off
09:05  racar: sometimes ... you need to go to sleep ;)
09:05  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, also check this if you face an issue http://haslayout.net/css/ could be a real bug
09:06  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, usually you avoid issues when you do clear and well structured html
09:06  Lazylegs: In most cases the big problems are more about html than css
09:07  WierdAAR: Lazylegs, Thanks... And my html are pretty clear and structured.. -> http://demo.hyperbolic-space.com/
09:07  WierdAAR: ....I think so anyway...
09:08  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, there's always something to refine and do other ways to keep it clearer.. but that is not bad at all what you have done :) and this is really subjective thing
09:09  WierdAAR: Lazylegs, Yeah.. Perfection is hard to reach hehe. But thanks!. I'm kind of a neat freak.. All the divs are actually php includes, so the actually file is even more minimal.. weeeee!
09:09  MauriceJ: Yeah, I found WierdAAR's HTML refreshing to look at: good code and clean.
09:10  WierdAAR: MauriceJ, Thanks..!  :)
09:10  MauriceJ: WierdAAR: If you saw all the divitis and other hell that comes through here.... :D
09:12  Lazylegs: WierdAAR, semantically thinking.. I do not know what your goal is, but the box1, box2... have <h1> in them.. if the titles are really really important, use h1. but do not use it to make font bigger

10:51  paleywiener: i'm trying to theme them for the seasons so they ought to be equally good
10:51  nikki`: you asked which one is better...
10:51  paleywiener: yup :p hmm so why is the blue better than the yellow
10:52  nikki`: its prettier
10:52  nikki`: :P
10:52  paleywiener: looks blurry? colors not sharp? oh!
10:54  paleywiener: hmm.. so how should i fix the yellow one?? any suggestions..
10:54  nikki`: well they are both outdated designs
10:54  nikki`: but as prefrence, i preffered that one

11:00  disappearedng: just out of curiosity, what's the best job place for top css designers to go to? (Like engineering it would be google and fb, but does that apply to designers as well? )
11:01  freen: is it possible to change the height of the scroller pointer or whatever its called on a html selet
11:01  freen: select
11:01  oksushi: ]css form styling @ freen
11:01  _ZofBot4: freen, CSS 2.1 does not define which properties apply to form controls and frames, or how CSS can be used to style them. User agents may apply CSS properties to these elements. Authors are recommended to treat such support as experimental. ( http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#conformance )
11:01  oksushi: so no
11:01  freen: disappearedng: what makes you think engineers want to go to facebook?
11:02  oksushi: disappearedng: 'top css designers' would unlikely be trawling Web sites looking for work.
11:02  freen: scrappy over ajaxed app written by students
11:02  freen: ok oksushi
11:02  freen: I have a select with opt groups and the scroller is so small since there are so many options
11:03  freen: might have to split them out
11:05  nikki`: paleywiener: i just mean it looks like an old design
11:05  nikki`: but it also looks perfectly fine and not bad
11:07  paleywiener: oh.. umm.. yeah but umm.. since i'm a n00b at this.. could you suggest some resource where i could see different designs. I'm not very creative :p
11:07  paleywiener: like  a book or umm something
11:07  nikki`: search google
11:08  paleywiener: for what css templates?
11:08  paleywiener: already did that <g>
11:08  paleywiener: most of emm were okayish..
11:08  nikki`: no for nice looking websites
11:08  nikki`: you dont want any templates.
11:09  oksushi: paleywiener: did the resource I gave you yesterday not help?

11:16  [eXception]: Hi
11:16  nikki`: hi
11:16  [eXception]: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0k   ..this does not work when you have the <P> inside of a <DIV> (assumed: div= height;10em, p becomes line height).
11:18  oksushi: does nto work?
11:18  oksushi: ]doesnt work @ [eXception]
11:18  _ZofBot4: [eXception], Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
11:18  freen: lol
11:21  [eXception]: <oksushi>: It means, that the intended output is not given
11:22  [eXception]: which was: Wrap the Text inside of an outer container with a given height correctly at the line end, instead of cropping it in the middle of the line.
11:23  MauriceJ: [eXception]: Way to draw this out: What the hell are you trying to do?
11:25  [eXception]: what I want is simple: <div style="height:10em;overflow:hidden"><p>huge_text</p></div> . In this container the Text (variable font size) should never show half text-lines at the bottom.
11:26  [eXception]: www.webdevout.net/test?0k <--  this is not bad, but it doesnt help me, because it has no DIV around his P
11:27  nikki`: [eXception: makes no sense
11:27 --- chrislabeard_ is now known as chrislabeard
11:29  freen: [eXception]: take the margin-top off P
11:29  oksushi: [eXception]: this does as you say http://www.webdevout.net/test?02h&raw
11:31  freen: [eXception]: is SHOULD show half text lines.. depending on size because your have a strict height with overflowing content
11:32  freen: the P container has no concept of individual line height, it won't divide the height by each line....
11:43  [eXception]: freen: so the only solution is to compare the div.height to the p with a script (js or serverside) ? So its not possible with css right?
11:44  oksushi: [eXception]: my solution didn't solve your issue?
11:45  [eXception]: oh. sry havent seen it
11:45 * [eXception] is evaluating...
11:49 --- dunkel2_ is now known as dunkel2[iPad]
11:50  freen: oksushi: the margin doesn't seem to be his issue, although it is an issue
11:50  oksushi: it was getting the height of the box to cut off the text at the right place
11:53  freen: ah i see you added divs
11:53  freen: [eXception]: is oksushi link not what you need?
11:54  freen: and no you dont need javascript
11:57  freen: [eXception]: my rant about P was completely wrong, I was getting mixed up with your set width ... instead of height.
11:58  afeijo: hi guys
11:58  afeijo: I want my div to cover the whole page, so I set both width and height to 100% and I set display: block; it didnt work, what am I missing?

12:13  danjjdh762: hi
12:13  oksushi: milligan: what's up with your html?
12:14  oksushi: milligan: the answer to your question is that you need to remove the default margin and padding from your <ul> that are under the images
12:15  oksushi: milligan: I suggest you learn about 'definition lists'
12:16  milligan: oksushi, cheers mate :)
12:16  notregistered: in firefox I use margin-left: -25px; to position a div and when the page is short (no scrollbar) it displays correctly, but when the page is long (scollbar), the div is moved 1px extra to the left. Is there a fix for this?
12:21  oksushi: notregistered: http://haslayout.net/css-tuts/Fixing-Page-Shift-Problem
12:22  oksushi: it's not really a problem though
12:22  oksushi: just the changing of width of the viewport
12:28  notregistered: the overflow option ruined my menubar inside IE :p
12:29  notregistered: strange.. it got fixed by itself
12:29  notregistered: maybe some caching stuff going on

13:23  notregistered: that shoild be possible
13:24  Prototype0: How do I make one <div> be on the right side of a parent <div>, while another be on the left side of it? (on the same line)
13:24  rosstitute: border-collapse seems to remove all border elements
13:24  notregistered: Prototype0: both to be float: left
13:24  notregistered: the leftmost first
13:25  notregistered: rosstitute: do you absolutly need the border-collapse? why not just use border: 0;?
13:26  Prototype0: I mean, both <div>s are contained in a single parent <div>. I want to be on its right side, while the other on the opposite side.
13:26  Prototype0: Also, float has some strange effect on the borders
13:26  nikki`: Prototype0: same thing, just make sure the main div is wide enough
13:26  Prototype0: Oh
13:27  Prototype0: Do I have to fix the borders too?
13:27  Prototype0: I mean, manually?
13:27  danjjdh762: how remove spacing between <input> tag. Tried padding,border, and margin 0px but didnt help

13:28  Prototype0: danjjdh762, position them?

13:31  notregistered: horizontally?

13:32  notregistered: when using p
13:32  danjjdh762: notregistered: between top and bottom
13:32  notregistered: and you have tried to have padding/margin 0 on the <p> tag?
13:33  danjjdh762: notregistered: not specifically, on the form id attribute
13:33  Prototype0: Can I adjust line-height for normal text?
13:33  danjjdh762: notregistered: should apply to everything in the form tag i believe
13:33  notregistered: so you have #formid p { margin: 0; padding: 0; } ?
13:34  notregistered: try to apply it specifically
13:34  notregistered: Prototype0: line-height: 1.5; in the body tag maybe
13:34  danjjdh762: ok
13:34  Prototype0: I need for it to be in a <div> and it doesn't seem to work. Can I remove to indentation from a <ul>?
13:35  notregistered: yes.. margin and padding 0 on the ul tag
13:35  notregistered: and li tags
13:35  Prototype0: Oh

13:36  danjjdh762: notregistered:  #formid p { margin: 0; padding: 0; }  didnt work either. any other ideas?

13:42  wathek: Hi all
13:43  wathek: how do you do to style elements, let's say divs, that got the <p> tag ? only those divs ?
13:44  Lazylegs: wathek, you cant with css.. no parent selector or anything that would check if parent has child like you want

14:01  ComradeHaz`: Hi all. I am trying to replicate http://harriersview.com/newSite/HarriersView/Cottage.html using just html and css. At the moment I am trying to do the buttons on the left. So far I have http://lithitux.org/~haz/
14:01  ComradeHaz`: Can anyone assist, please?
14:02  Prototype0: Can I make float elements stretch the containing element's borders?
14:02  sriley: look up an article about containing floats by ed elliot
14:03  Prototype0: thanks
14:03  Prototype0: ComradeHaz`, are you familiar with CSS?
14:04  ComradeHaz`: Prototype0: This is day four of my steep learning curve.
14:04  ComradeHaz`: Need to have pretty much rewritten that site by Monday or I am in BIG trouble
14:04  ComradeHaz`: facing significant imbarasment
14:05  Prototype0: Well, first of all you'll need to make sure each of the links has its own container.
14:05  ComradeHaz`: Really?
14:05  ComradeHaz`: Crazy.
14:06  ComradeHaz`: so I need to specify a div for each?
14:06  Prototype0: Why is that so crazy?
14:06  ComradeHaz`: Meh
14:06  ComradeHaz`: Just surprises me
14:06  ComradeHaz`: But as I say, day four :D
14:06  Prototype0: Then set up the spacing between the containers.
14:06  ComradeHaz`: So more than happy to take your word for it!
14:07  Prototype0: Alternatively, I suppose you could use line-height
14:07  ComradeHaz`: Okay.
14:07  ComradeHaz`: Any hints?
14:07  Prototype0: Yeah, you probably can
14:07  ComradeHaz`: Code based hints, I mean
14:07  Prototype0: It's in a list, right?
14:07  ComradeHaz`: Obviously the replaceing of picture on mouseover is important
14:08  ComradeHaz`: Well, it is, but that may be incorrect
14:08  Prototype0: Why?
14:08  ComradeHaz`: I don;t know if pictures should go in a list - probably not.
14:08  Prototype0: They can, and do.
14:08  ComradeHaz`: Ah, cool.
14:08  ComradeHaz`: So my thinking was correct.
14:08  Prototype0: But why shoulod there be pictures?
14:08  ComradeHaz`: As you can see I stuck that W3C logo on as a test
14:09  Prototype0: the mouseover is solid color
14:09  ComradeHaz`: and I can't make it validate
14:09  ComradeHaz`: needs to be a picture because not a standard font
14:09  Prototype0: D:
14:09  ComradeHaz`: Am I chatting shit?
14:11  Prototype0: No, you're right.
14:11  Prototype0: The design is just strange.
14:11  ComradeHaz`: Design of what?
14:11  nikki`: ComradeHaz: look into cufon fonts
14:12  Prototype0: He needs to reproduce the site exactly, so I think the images are required as they are.
14:12  ComradeHaz`: Well, it doesn't actually have to be exactly
14:12  ComradeHaz`: But that is the design I am currently working to
14:13  ComradeHaz`: slight changes would be ok
14:13  ComradeHaz`: especially if they are improvements
14:13  Prototype0: Can you not use images and use normal text?
14:13  xomp: good morning everyone :)
14:13  Prototype0: And change the backcolor on mouseover?
14:13  Prototype0: mornin'
14:13  ComradeHaz`: If I can find an appropriate font, I guess I can
14:14  xomp: Not sure why this is doing this, but I believe I'm having a span issue with my forums "Quick Reply" section (at the very bottom of the page). It seems to cause a horizontal scroll bar to appear at the bottom of the page here http://www.busybeingbrutal.com/showthread.php?tid=680 any ideas how I can fix this?
14:16  Prototype0: ComradeHaz`, that won't work. The point here is that you change the font to a standard one. People can't see a font they don't have installed.
14:17  Prototype0: which browser are you using? xomp
14:17  ComradeHaz`: Indeed, which is why I went down the image route.
14:17  xomp: Prototype0, Firefox
14:18  nikki`: image as text is poor :(
14:18  ComradeHaz`: how does this cufon thing work?
14:18  nikki`: http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/
14:18  Prototype0: It is horrible. And all just so users will be able to see some guy's 'cool font'
14:19  ComradeHaz`: nikki`: yeah, there, what does it do?
14:19  nikki`: allows you to use custom fonts
14:19  nikki`: without using images
14:19 --- graphitemaster is now known as kfbot
14:19  ComradeHaz`: by uploading the font to the web
14:19  ComradeHaz`: ?
14:19  Prototype0: what does it use?
14:19  ComradeHaz`: sounds like an even worse hack
14:19  Prototype0: xomp, I can't see it
14:19  Prototype0: Is it on a particular page?
14:20  ComradeHaz`: Let's stick with images :D
14:20  nikki`: ComradeHaz: its not a hack, nor is it worse
14:20  nikki`: using images as text is the worst of the worst
14:20 --- kfbot is now known as graphitemaster
14:20  nikki`: you just havent looked into it enough, so ebfore commenting, look into how it works... youll find its actually very good
14:20  xomp: Prototype0, it seems to only effect the showthread.php pages where a quick reply form is needed. Are you not able to see the page at all or the quick reply form?
14:20  Prototype0: Wait, it uses flash?
14:21  Prototype0: Maybe because I'm not registered.
14:21  xomp: Prototype0, you can use this test account if you wanna login to see, username: urbrutal password: urbrutal
14:22  Prototype0: it only appears on firefox
14:22  xomp: ahhh
14:23  xomp: I never use IE for ethical reasons :P
14:23  Prototype0: I mainly use Chrome
14:23  Prototype0: What did you change before this happened?
14:24  xomp: Prototype0, the original quick reply did give you any formatting options at all. I found a MyBB plugin that gave you this advanced quick reply (which is the standard reply) for a quick reply
14:24  xomp: s/did/didn't
14:25  xomp: so I'm not 100% sure what it changed since it was an automatic modification caused by a plugin :\
14:27  Prototype0: Can you just wrap everything in a div and give it a fixed width?
14:28  xomp: that's the thing, I'm no expert in this at all heh, it took nearly a year of me poking and prodding to get the look I currently have by changing a small value here and there.
14:28  xomp: I was hoping maybe it was a simple width change or something equally easy to pull off somewhere in all that code hah
14:31  Prototype0: there are some suspicious things, but I'm not exactly sure what's causing it.
14:31  Prototype0: especially since it's a combination of stylesheets, in-line styles, and html table styling.
14:32  xomp: heh yeah, I tried hard to get the plugin author to fix his plugin but sadly he's dutch and they aren't exactly known to have a good work ethic :P
14:33  tsyrak: lol
14:33  tsyrak: it could be worse
14:33  tsyrak: he could be careless like a french
14:33  tsyrak: or aslow like an american
14:33  tsyrak: :P
14:33  xomp: hehe
14:34  nikki`: how are americans slow?...
14:34  nikki`: have you seen how fast they can run to mcdonals?
14:34  ZombieLoffe: drive to
14:34  ZombieLoffe: *
14:34  Prototype0: At any rate, a div limiting the width of the quickreply plugin to the current width the page should't disturb anything. The width is fixed anyway.
14:34  nikki`: lol
14:35  xomp: Prototype0, ah okay. I'm not privy on how that's done so I think I'll let this little issue ride it out. With my luck I'll end up trying to figure it on my own and end up with an upside down website hah
14:37  xomp: or maybe I can talk my users into using anything but firefox hah
14:38  nikki`: i think youll find if it fails in ff it will also in opera
14:38  xomp: I have a friend that works for firefox
14:38  xomp: maybe I can ask him to tell me why this is doing this xD
14:39  xomp: doubt it would be any use since he is over the jaegermonkey thing there
15:10  ogp: how can i get this page to align on IE, in FF it works fine http://www.onegreenplanet.org/channel/animals/

How can I make it so no matter what size the font is, it will always be in the middle of the div. I usually do tihs using margin top but as the size of the text is not static id have to change the margin top to fit in with the text size. can it not do it auto?

16:08  daviddoria: if I want three divs to appear horizontally next to each other (i.e A B C), do I have to float anything?
16:09  NET||abuse: all the divs : P
16:09  daviddoria: really?? but I thought you only had to float something if you wanted to take it out of the "flow"
16:09  daviddoria: but here the three things ARE the flow, right?
16:10  NET||abuse: it's just one of those things :) the flow reaserts itself inside those divs
16:10  NET||abuse: at least that's how i think of it.
16:10  daviddoria: so do I float the left one left, the right one right, and the center one __ ?
16:11  NET||abuse: there's a few ways it can work,j ust float:left; all 3 an dset widths
16:11  NET||abuse: or else if you want to understand more, read up on some of the layout tutorials.

16:12  Lazylegs: daviddoria, http://oksushi.com/test/3col-no-margin/ check from that

16:18  JSM87: I have a div that is 500px in height. I have a div within that div which contains text. Sometimes there is 300px whitespace for the div to fill, sometimes there is 200px. How can I make it so no matter how much text is in the child div, it never spans out of the parent div (I want it to be hidden)
16:19  JSM87: The same way overflow:hidden works except I cant specify a height.
16:19  JSM87: Because the height is different (using php and database etc)
16:22  sandman64: overflow: hidden doesn't work?
16:25  JSM87: sandman64: Only if I specify a height, but they height is always different
16:25  Tempus2: Are absolute elements not part of the page flow?
16:25  Lazylegs: daviddoria, sorry for delay.. inline-block is ok to use, http://colinaarts.com/articles/inline-block-and-you/
16:25  JSM87: basically there is a container div that i never want any of its contents to span outside of it
16:25  JSM87: if they go over the height limit of the container I simply want anything trying to overflow to disapear
16:27  iaj: hmm.. can someone help me.. on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=3  - the limiters (which are images actually) between "Produkt", "Ueber uns" and Karriere... are placed 1 pixel too far on top... is there some way to fix this?
16:27  Lazylegs: JSM87, max-height and overflow: hidden?
16:27  JSM87: Lazylegs: I cant use max-height as sometimes other childs displayed inside of the container div are not there, hence the div with the text has more space to use
16:28  Lazylegs: iaj, top: -5px for them?
16:28  JSM87: in other words the container div can sometimes have 8 child divs, 5 child divs, 7 child divs etc etc, but it will always have a div in it with text. I want the text to always use up the white space but never spill out of the container div
16:28  iaj: Lazylegs: hmmmm.... but they look ok on firefox
16:29  iaj: won't they be affected there then :)
16:29  sandman64: max-height: inheret?
16:29  Lazylegs: they will :)
16:29  iaj: Lazylegs: its actually a top: -6px attribute
16:29  sandman64: inherit*
16:30  JSM87: sandman64: max-height: inherit; didnt work
16:30  Lazylegs: iaj, what you could do is. discard the span element that has the separator. And use the image as background of the li element. and position it with background-position or use shorthand background
16:31  iaj: Lazylegs: hmmm yeah... that sounds good... =)
16:31  JSM87: sandman64: Something like z-index would work perfect where it kind of just lies underneath everything if it tries to expland over it
16:31  JSM87: But z-index didnt work
16:32  sandman64: did you set a z-index for the other divs as well, just in case the chosen browser's default settings were conflicting
16:33  JSM87: sandman64: I made the container div z-index:5 and the div with the text z-index:0
16:33  JSM87: In my mind it shouldnt be able to break out over the top of the container but it does
16:35  sandman64: that's strange
16:35  Tempus2: How can I make the page scroll when the right links of the page is outside the screen? It doesn't make a scrollbar before you can only see parts of the main portion? http://bcreativewilde.com/main_page.php the links are placed absolute, does this affect it?
16:36  sandman64: did you explicitly state position: on the the divs?
16:36  JSM87: sandman64: No I havnt done anything with position
16:37  sandman64: try using position:relative on the divs you're working on, then try setting the z-index
16:37  JSM87: position:relative on the div with text on
16:37  JSM87: or on the parent container too?#
16:38  sandman64: both
16:39  JSM87: sandman64: Tried, didnt work
16:39  JSM87: ive just stuck overflow:hidden on the container div
16:39  JSM87: that did the trick, obviously really. Silly me

17:15  koskoz: hi guys
17:16  koskoz: i've got li with padding, and a background on the ul, but the ul's height is smaller than the li's height so the background doesn't fit
17:16  koskoz: any idea ?
17:18  johnathanb: li display:block?
17:19  koskoz: johnathanb: just found the fix, I need to float my li's and add an overflow: hidden on my ul
17:19  johnathanb: That won't work in netscape navigator.
17:20  koskoz: johnathanb: any one still use netscape ? oO
17:20  johnathanb: I doubt it, but I still support it.
17:20  HappyPelican|Mac: haha
17:20  HappyPelican|Mac: Why do you support something nobody uses?
17:20  johnathanb: I'll spend more time on IE5 than I would on Netscape, but I try to make it look as good in Netscape as it does in say Chrome or Safari
17:21  HappyPelican|Mac: Why?
17:21  koskoz: I start at ie6
17:21  johnathanb: Just in case someone is forced to use it, I'm going to support them.
17:21  HappyPelican|Mac: That's silly
17:21  koskoz: ahah, you'r really crazy
17:21  HappyPelican|Mac: Even IE6 support is rapidly declining
17:21  johnathanb: Yea, I'm joking. I actually build for Chrome and fix the rest if I have time.
17:22  WierdAAR: Hey guys.. Would anybody be willing to take this http://demo.hyperbolic-space.com/ through IE6 and tell me what works and what dosen't ?
17:22  johnathanb: I build specifically for Chrome because that's what I use then Safari, FF, Opera, IE8, IE7 and normally don't touch IE6.
17:23  johnathanb: I just find all browsers useless.

17:23  johnathanb: I built a script that all I do is give it a URL and it come back with a page, strips all the HTML, CSS and JS from it and displays it to me in plain text.
17:24  HappyPelican|Mac: WierdAAR: Test yourself on IE tester or on XP under Virtual PC
17:24  johnathanb: ^^That would be bull shit as well btw.
17:24  HappyPelican|Mac: koskoz: what?

17:43  webben: ComradeHaz`: If you want a generic container for block-level elements (e.g. table h1 p) you need div not span
17:44  ComradeHaz`: Um, OK.... ish This is only day 4 of web dev so it would probbably help if you could elaborate a little...
17:45  webben: ComradeHaz`: At the most basic level, renderable HTML elements are either block-level (think paragraphs, headings, tables)
17:45  ComradeHaz`: Also, webben, can you see what is causing things to move up in the container such that the bottom of the page breaks the way it does?
17:46  webben: ComradeHaz`: Or inline-level (e.g. a word in a paragraph)
17:46  ComradeHaz`: Okay...
17:46  ComradeHaz`: That makes sense.
17:46  webben: ComradeHaz`: div and span are generic block-level and inline-level elements
17:46  ComradeHaz`: respectively, you mean?
17:47  webben: yep
17:47  ComradeHaz`: Okay...
17:47  ComradeHaz`: So why is what I've done wrong?
17:47  webben: ComradeHaz`: Don't have time to debug the CSS atm, but someone else will likely help if you fix the HTML to be valid :)
17:48  webben: ComradeHaz`: In general "move down" should be a matter of adding margin-top or padding-top to an element.
17:49  ComradeHaz`: Well, annoying thins is, it was OK and I broke it by adding something

18:37  Prototype0: nikki, instll chrome/firefox
18:37  nikki`: yeah i should
18:37  Prototype0: By force if necessayr
18:37  ComradeHaz`: :D
18:37  telfire: I just got my room mate to switch from IE to Chrome lol
18:37  nikki`: but anything different then ie6/hotmail i think she would freak
18:37  ComradeHaz`: haha
18:37  ComradeHaz`: Sunds about right
18:37  Prototype0: I got several people to switch to Chrome from IE and some firefox
18:38  ComradeHaz`: I think I have actually uninstalled IE from my parent's win 7 machines
18:38  nikki`: lol
18:38  ComradeHaz`: pretty sure I did
18:38  nikki`: thats nice of you
18:38  Prototype0: Can you do that?
18:38  telfire: err, you can't..
18:38  telfire: without like breaking everything
18:38  ComradeHaz`: sure you can
18:38  Prototype0: you can close the service
18:38  ComradeHaz`: win 7 doesn't require it anymore
18:38  Prototype0: Oh
18:38  Prototype0: Interesting
18:38  telfire: ohh, didn't realize that
18:39  telfire: I mean, in XP, practically every aplication out there used trident
18:39  Prototype0: trident?
18:39  nikki`: there is programs out allowing you to remove ie on all windows machines
18:39  ComradeHaz`: think a lot have gone to webkit now
18:39  Prototype0: can't you just close the service?
18:39  nikki`: cant remember what its called thouh.... but youd have to seriously hate ie with a passion to do that
18:39  telfire: Trident = IE's rendering engine
18:39  Prototype0: Oh
18:40  telfire: But yes, webkit has become standard
18:40  telfire: thank god
18:40  ComradeHaz`: yeah, nikki` but was always problematic, especially on XP which of course used ie for windoze update
18:40  Prototype0: I installed Firefox in my office in the army :P
18:40  Prototype0: It breaks all the pages but I still insist on using it
18:40  Prototype0: (everyone there uses IE6)
18:40  ComradeHaz`: My uni push ms and ie
18:40  Prototype0: Even new computers have IE6 installed
18:40  ComradeHaz`: Does my head in
18:41  nikki`: ie6 will be stopped this year
18:41  ComradeHaz`: I have firefox portable installed to my usersace there :D
18:41  telfire: So... does anyone know why this float is fucking with my page's centering lol? http://www.whywaitwebs.com/associated-rubber would really appreciate if someone could help me out
18:41 * Prototype0 can't see it
18:41  Prototype0: wait
18:41  Prototype0: perhaps..
18:41  ComradeHaz`: Prototype0: can you justify the txt
18:42  ComradeHaz`: *text
18:42  ComradeHaz`: that'd prob look better
18:42  telfire: I know IE can double margins on floats and I thought maybe that was it, but I already applied the fix to no avail :(
18:42  Prototype0: aha
18:42  Ose: any opinions on what is a good text color on http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/e/e6/DirtTex.png ? most of what i've tried is kind of eye-straining
18:42  nikki`: telfire: in ff?
18:42  Prototype0: I forgot IE8 has a "feature" that introduces all the bugs and incorrect rendering of IE6.
18:42  telfire: nikki`: hmm? FF seems to display it fine?
18:43  nikki`: what browser does it 'fuck up'
18:43  telfire: IE7
18:43  nikki`: 1 sec
18:43  Prototype0: The problem is that the text and images don't contract properly?
18:44  telfire: The main page content isn't actually centered -- it looks like it's factoring the float into the centering -- and if you squish the page enough all the content just goes below the float. and this also causes the footer to not be aligned properly so the logo is like half off the bg and such
18:44  nikki`: ah the main container?
18:45  nikki`: does testim need to be inline?
18:45  nikki`: display:inline;
18:45  telfire: It is :/
18:46  nikki`: try floating #main left
18:46  telfire: but if I float it left won't it.. not center?
18:46  nikki`: 1 sec
18:46  telfire: at least in real browsers
18:46  telfire: yeah, float:left breaks it in Chrome
18:46  nikki`: see id be tempted to put testim div in the main wrapper
18:47  nikki`: and make main wider
18:47  nikki`: then its going to be easier to control
18:47  nikki`: then margin:0 auto the main div
18:47  ComradeHaz`: Right guys, I'm not winning on my own. http://lithitux.org/~haz/ First off. Left link bar, I need to move the ul down without pushing out the bottom. Do I need to make another container of some description?
18:48  telfire: ok nikki`  I'll give that a shot. thanks for the tip
18:48  nikki`: nps let me know
18:48  ComradeHaz`: My top nav bar seems to be as wide as the overall container and I don't understand why. Can anyone explain why what I have got working actually works?
18:49  telfire: so, make a new div to center the content ?
18:49  nikki`: its margin:0 0 0 200px;
18:49  nikki`: ComradeHaz`
18:49  nikki`: float it right and give it a right margin instead :P
18:49  ComradeHaz`: Oh, and also, the page title (ie 'The cottage)  needs to come down too
18:50  nikki`: no telfire
18:50  ComradeHaz`: Um, nikki` not sure that's what I mean
18:50  nikki`: you got the css open?
18:50  ComradeHaz`: note the red outline it has, it goes all the way to the right.
18:50  Prototype0: Give it a fixed width
18:50  ComradeHaz`: Even if I change it's width all teh way to 1 it doesn't change
18:50  nikki`: 1 sec ComradeHaz`
18:50  ComradeHaz`: if I make it 0 though, it all breaks
18:50  nikki`: telfire open your css file
18:51  telfire: oh it's open lol
18:51  ComradeHaz`: (or remove the specification of a width)
18:51  nikki`: and the page
18:51  telfire: Actually, I have half a mind to just leave it at flexible width. It doesn't look shabby
18:51  nikki`: move testim and its contents into 'main'
18:51  nikki`: then make main an extra 200 px wide
18:52  ComradeHaz`: Um
18:52  ComradeHaz`: I said that wrong.
18:52  telfire: But then it's not floated to the left all the way
18:52  nikki`: gimme your ftp details lol :P
18:52  telfire: and also it doesn't wrap like it's supposed to, so people with 1080 wide would have to sidescroll
18:53  nikki`: give the main container a width
18:53  nikki`: and margin:0 auto;
18:53  nikki`: simple
18:53  nikki`: get rid of the float too
18:54  telfire: Like I said.. That doesn't produce desired results
18:54  telfire: hold on I'll do it and show
18:54  nikki`: it does!!! becuase you can just add one more div inside main, after the left container and contain it easily centering the whole thing
18:55  telfire: kk - http://www.whywaitwebs.com/associated-rubber/ -- the width is way too wide for small screens, the float is not on the left, it is inside the content
18:55  nikki`: 1000px
18:55  telfire: you said add 200 px lol
18:55  nikki`: i know
18:56  nikki`: your site is 1000px wide
18:56  telfire: I guess it's not "way" too wide but it's a bit close for comfort, more importantly the side bar is not on the side, it's molesting my content
18:56  nikki`: anyway shh just do it
18:58  nikki`: its a debate how wide a website should be, youll see alot on google of different answers, personally i set to 960px wide and center the full container and if you look at 'ebay' and other busy sites youll see they do simular
18:59  telfire: yeah that is what I like is to stay under 1000
18:59  telfire: I'm more concerned about the way it looks though lol. The sidebar needs to be on the side
18:59  telfire: But, flexible width doesn't look all too bad... I might see what the client thinks about that
18:59  nikki`: yes it would be though
19:00  nikki`: what your doing is bassicly having two divs in one main div
19:00  telfire: no, it wouldn't, and it isn't. I implemented everything you said. The sidebar is inside the content. That is the problem
19:00  nikki`: the left collumn, and the main collumn
19:00  nikki`: let me pastie your code
19:00  nikki`: 1 sec
19:00  telfire: if the main has a width, and the testim is in the main, then the testim will only be as far to the left as the width of the main. It can't go outside it.
19:01  nikki`: yes
19:01  nikki`: but it will still be floated left
19:02 * stickDeath ate segunda fiquem bem
19:03  ComradeHaz`: Um, can height not be specified without width?
19:03  telfire: well that's not the look I'm going for :/ it really ruins the page..thanks for the try tho
19:04  buddyq: hey guys, what is the site to put tests with html./css/js at?
19:04  buddyq: I have a problem I can't seem to track down.
19:05  buddyq: <a><img></a> is creating extra space below the image that I don't want. There is no margin or padding on the a or img.
19:08  Prototype0: link?
19:09 --- Guest27540 is now known as karstensrage
19:12  ComradeHaz`: OK guys, I understand why what I have been trying to do doesn't work, but I now have a horrible feeling this means I need to create new elements within current ones. What I want is to move text in 3 places, in all cases down, by differing ammounts. They are the title, the left nav bar and the top nav bar (just a few px's here). Please can someone tell me how I do this? It's driving me insane!
19:12  draginx: http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1597/cripplewarsmap.jpg why would those black blocks be spaced out like that if i have .. line-height:0;word-spacing:0;letter-spacing:0; font-size:0; ?
19:12  draginx: doesn't make ANY sense and this is chrome we're tslking about (mac chrome works fine windows chrome doesnt)
19:17  agu10^: ?
19:18  agu10^: draginx, you never heard about something called 'bug' ?
19:18  draginx: agu10^: there are ways around but damn webkit should be consistant
19:18  agu10^: 'should', of course
19:19  agu10^: bugs are common things. when you develop you have to be aware that 80% of your work is debugging, even when bugs are not your fault, or not in your code
19:19  agu10^: code = 80% bugs
19:19  draginx: .......
19:19  agu10^: :P
19:19  draginx: ive been coding for 8 years thanks, but seriously why would this spacing still happen?
19:19  agu10^: idk
19:20  agu10^: problem is fixing the actual webkit source code won't fix it immediately
19:20  agu10^: until people upgrade
19:22  draginx: …Im talking about through CSS
19:22  draginx: this may not even be a webkit issue -_-

19:30  halcyon1234: Hi. Is there a way to be transparent through it's parent container, into the background of it's grandparent? Kindof like a div creating a hole through it's parent.  This is the structure I'm thinking: http://jsfiddle.net/pugvu/
19:31  ComradeHaz`: They're all hiding halcyon1234, they don't like my question!
19:32  ComradeHaz`: (Even though it is a really simple one!)
19:40  sigel: Hi, I have a div (page-container) which is my main most outter box... I have a width set, not a height.. inside of the div I have another div which floats left. My problem is, the main div is not expanding height wise even though the div inside of it is longer
19:47  qq99: My parent div has min-height:700px, but my children with height:100% aren't obtaining this height, is it possible to remedy this easily?
19:48  qq99: sorry if this is an annoying question
19:49 --- MarcelT3_ is now known as MarcelT3
19:50  qq99: ugh I think I'm going to need to duplicate the n-column layout strategy, seems so wrong though
19:52  sriley: height:100% doesnt work like that, look up faux columns
19:53  qq99: I see it will work as expected with height but not min-height
19:53  qq99: I'm looking up some more now
19:53  sriley: yes it will only work if you set a height on the parent
19:55  qq99: I would almost classify that as bug... setting min-height is effectively setting a height in my eyes
19:55  qq99: and in any case, shouldn't it be able to support some kind of reflection?  clearly the div has a height in all cases, just query that, then take the %... I don't know why height must be explicit
20:01  Aikar: I have a div with 4 images 2x2, looks fine on normal zoom, but if user zooms out, the images fall on top of each other (in FF at least). the div and the images all have width. what can i do to fix this?
20:01  halcyon1234: Hi. Is there a way to be transparent through it's parent container, into the background of it's grandparent? Kindof like a div creating a hole through it's parent.  This is the structure I'm thinking: http://jsfiddle.net/pugvu/
20:01  devinrolsen: got a weird issue from a client who runs Linux. When they page zoom in our out a few div boxes on the page get these black lines or borders... anyone ever seen this before?
20:03 --- [netman]_ is now known as [netman]
20:09  qq99: Aikar, maybe wrap the img in divs with a set width/height too
20:09  qq99: I think a lot goes out the window with browser zoom though, depending on implementation
20:10  qq99: halcyon1234, afaik that is impossible (think of it as a layered structure), css provides no means to remove a section of a background
20:10  qq99: halcyon1234, you could maybe do it with a transparent .png though, pita though
20:11  qq99: halcyon1234, with the .png method, it would certainly seem doable, but you'd have to re-make the .png every time you wanted to resize the seethru? div

20:17  llrcombs: hey
20:18  llrcombs: the quality picker shown in .video-format-MP4::after{
20:18  llrcombs:     display: block;
20:18  llrcombs:     top: 8px;
20:18  llrcombs:     right: 3px;
20:18  llrcombs:     position: absolute;
20:18  llrcombs: sorry
20:18  llrcombs: I mis-copy/pasted
20:18  llrcombs: http://combsconnections.tk/quality.png
20:18  llrcombs: the quality picker there
20:19  llrcombs: the colored dots are how I'm currently conveying the format (FLV, MP4, WebM)
20:19  llrcombs: but the purpose isn't really clear
20:20  sigel: anyway to align something to the right without using float?
20:22  sigel: as soon as I put float.. the div floats right outside of its parent div lol
20:23  qq99: llrcombs, what's the question?
20:23  llrcombs: I used to put a <sub>FLV</sub> or similar in
20:23  llrcombs: but that took up way too much space and looked pretty ugly
20:23  qq99: sigel, is the parent a block with width?
20:23  qq99: shouldn't be floating outside
20:24  sigel: do I have to make it a block, is that my prob
20:24  llrcombs: so I figured I'd use a ::after with a color (red: FLV, ylw: WebM, grn: MP4)
20:24  llrcombs: but it's not really clear what the intent is
20:25  llrcombs: so I thought, maybe an ::after with the format and content:"WebM" with a small font size and good placement
20:25  llrcombs: but I'm having trouble finding a font that's legible at a size small enough to fit
20:26  sriley: youll need to use a pixel font probably
20:26  llrcombs: as you can see, the "HD" looks pretty ugly that small in Arial
20:27  llrcombs: any reccomendations?
20:27  jillianadriana: is there anyone who can help me with a background image issue?
20:27  llrcombs: jilliandriana: sure, shoot
20:27  sriley: silkscreen was a fairly decent pixel font
20:28  sriley: http://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/
20:28  jillianadriana: llrcombs: thanks! ok so this is what i asked for: http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v90/JillianVW/?action=view&current=bg.gif and this is what i got: http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v90/JillianVW/?action=view&current=bg-body.gif
20:28  jillianadriana: llrcombs: i guess the coder changed the image and i don't like it
20:29  llrcombs: jill: what's the CSS issue here?
20:30  jillianadriana: well i'm not sure if it's a css issue or html or what..?
20:31  llrcombs: sriley: this is a browser extension, and it's ill-advisable to loading a 27kb font on every pageload
20:31  jillianadriana: i provided them with a completely tileable image... why did they change it??
20:31  qq99: jillianadriana, ask them? lol get em to change it back
20:31  sigel: lol
20:31  jillianadriana: lol i will try
20:31  llrcombs: jill: you're not giving us anything we can do anything about
20:31  jillianadriana: ahh, i was afraid of that
20:31  llrcombs: we help when people have CSS that isn't doing what they don't want it to do
20:32  qq99: if you have both images, you could check the css to find the background on the page and just change the reference to the other image
20:32  llrcombs: or when people need advice on what CSS they should write
20:32  llrcombs: qq99: I don't think she has write access to the CSS
20:32  jillianadriana: i understand, thanks guys
20:32  llrcombs: anytime
20:33  sriley: you could strip the font down pretty small i suspect, and then should be cached
20:34  llrcombs: oh, could I make images for the names?
20:34  halcyon1234: qq99: Thanks for the answer (was afk). I think I'll just scrap the idea and come up with a different design.  (It was based on someone's Photoshop of "I wanna have my page look like this!", so I wasn't sure if it was possible)
20:34  sriley: well you could but i meant more about strip out the unused chars and convert to format for use with @font-face
20:34  qq99: halcyon1234, could always go flash :P
20:35  halcyon1234: qq99: There aren't enough showers in the world to wash the shame of that off. =)
20:35  qq99: sriley, yeah, I'd put em in the same tileset with the other things
20:35  qq99: sriley, whoops, meant directed @ llrcombs
20:35  qq99: halcyon1234 lol :)
20:36  sriley: id look at what size you can get the font down to first though, quite possibly smaller than however many spirited images
20:36  llrcombs: oh, I don't usually do tiles, since it doesn't actually do an HTTP request for each file
20:38  llrcombs: the font loading issue is more because of the memory it takes up and the actual downloading of the extension, whose size I like to keep down
20:40  sriley: but if you strip out the unused characters and converted it wouldnt be 27k
20:45  llrcombs: true, but still, why load a font when you can load an image
20:45  llrcombs: if I was using it for more, sure
20:45  llrcombs: but I'm not
20:52  ComradeHaz`: OK guys, I understand why what I have been trying to do doesn't work, but I now have a horrible feeling this means I need to create new elements within current ones.

20:52  ComradeHaz`: For those who haven't been around and are amenable to helping, site in question is currently at http://lithitux.org/~haz/
20:58  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: padding-top: Xpx;
20:59  ComradeHaz`: treebeen: of what, exactly?
20:59  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: height - Xpx
20:59  ComradeHaz`: because I suspect you may be mistaken :S
20:59  treebeen: .navTop for example
21:00  ComradeHaz`: But that moves down the entire thing pushing out the bottom
21:00  ComradeHaz`: or moving other things around
21:00  caverdude: hi, is there a practical line length limit for single web pages?
21:00  caverdude: or length limit anyway
21:00  caverdude: I mean it can be infinite
21:00  caverdude: but loading time might be an issue
21:01  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: if you want to center the text on .navTop use: line-height: 32px;
21:01  caverdude: wouldnt be great to put a 400 page book on a single page
21:01  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: you have to subtract the padding-top from the height
21:02  ComradeHaz`: treebeen: oh right, that's a bit naff, but I guess that makes sense
21:02  ComradeHaz`: Let's try
21:05  ComradeHaz`: treebeen: take another look! You've made me very happy!
21:05  caverdude: maybe there is a practical byte limit for single html files
21:05  JDigital: http://w3fools.com/
21:05  caverdude: ha
21:05  caverdude: that for me?
21:05  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: yeah, looks better :)
21:05  ComradeHaz`: treebeen: couple of other questions, if I may....(?)
21:06  treebeen: try it...
21:06  ComradeHaz`: top nav, just want to budge the text along to the right a bit. What do I apply the padding to? If I apply it to the ul it seems o effect each element in the list...
21:07  ComradeHaz`: Other one, the W3C logo I've stuck there just to make testing easier, but for the educational value of achieving this: how would I make thet be at the bottom of that nav bar?
21:10  mr_daniel: How can I give each <tr> in a <table> a border-bottom *and* border-top at the same time? For example here http://www.webdevout.net/test?03
21:11  ComradeHaz`: treebeen: ?
21:11  mr_daniel: My problem is that the <tr>s are omn above the other
21:11  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: one moment
21:11  mr_daniel: and becuase of this the border-top of a tr os hidden by another tr
21:12  ComradeHaz`: Sorry :)
21:13  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: you can add padding-left: to .navTop
21:15  treebeen: or maybe better put the ul into a div
21:15  treebeen: and do it there
21:16  llrcombs: http://combsconnections.tk/quality.png <-- now using the pixel font
21:16  llrcombs: look good?
21:19  ComradeHaz`: Sorry treebeen, She Who Must Be Obeyed Summoned me.
21:20  ComradeHaz`: So I can! Could have sworn I tried that.
21:21  ComradeHaz`: What about my silly logo treebeen? Not  that I care that much other than for the accadic exercise?
21:24  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: it's not bad IMO, maybe the text should be integrated a bit better
21:24  ComradeHaz`: Um, I'm talking specifically about the W3C logo question I asked before
21:28  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: maybe best would be to make two divs into the navleft
21:30  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I wondered that, and tried
21:30  ComradeHaz`: but ended up making a mess
21:36  Enchilada: How can I place a text just besides an h?
21:37  Enchilada: <h1>title</h1><span>hello world</span>
21:37  Enchilada: what can I do to that span, so that hello world will not go below title?
21:37  buddyq: make h1 display: inline
21:37  Cork[home]: Enchilada: you need to convert your h from display: block to inline-block or inline
21:38  Enchilada: but i still want subsequent material to appear below hello world
21:38  Enchilada: doing this would place subsequent material to the side of it. I guess I need a outer div around both, right?
21:38  Cork[home]: Enchilada: then put the span above it and do float right
21:39  Cork[home]: or put the span inside the h tag
21:39  Enchilada: ah ok. putting it inside would be easiest
21:40  buddyq: Enchilada: H1(display: inline) ; div around span and your content and then margin-left the wrapping div the width + spacing of the h1.
21:40  ComradeHaz`: hmm, treebeen, I cannot see a way to split that. truth is, I cannot really see why the things end up where they do when I define them. The individual sections I mean. I got here by luck, googling and asking here but I am not really sure why it all works
21:40  buddyq: so if the h1 is width 100px and you have a margin-right: 20px on it then margin-left your wrapper div 120px
21:42  Enchilada: Thanks sirs
21:42  Enchilada: are digits legal in class names? class="hello123"
21:43  Madmartigan: absolutely
21:43  Enchilada: nice
21:45  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: what browser are you using?
21:45  buddyq: yes but you can't start with a number
21:46  Enchilada: buddyq: okay
21:46  ComradeHaz`: Well, I wish to support all. At the moment I'm trying to keep it strictly W3C and hopefully avoid anything browser specific
21:46  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: no, i mean to develop
21:46  ComradeHaz`: Well, Fiefox
21:47  ComradeHaz`: but also keep trying in IE and chrome
21:47  treebeen: ComradeHaz`: then use firebug in firefox, or the dev tools in chrome
21:47  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I am
21:48  ComradeHaz`: that doesn't really answer my questions though
21:48  ComradeHaz`: It's helpful, sure
21:48  ComradeHaz`: but it doesn't explain why things work as they do
21:48  Madmartigan: is there any way to trigger display:inline-block in IE6 and IE7?
21:49  Madmartigan: or to emulate the behavior?
21:49  Madmartigan: without floats
21:50  Madmartigan: i want to give and inline element padding and margin
21:53  webPragmatist: does border-collapse only apply to tables or can i use it for floated <li> ?
