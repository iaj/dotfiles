00:01  dravekx: with or without attachment? nvm. texting while driving is bad.
00:01  user_corrupt: when i click on menu items on the following website, then red squares appear around them...I'm trying to get rid of it..does anyone know where the css is responsible for this? http://www.yourprinthouse.com
00:02  daviddoria: riven: when I replace the text with an image, the image then becomes not centered: http://daviddoria.com/HTMLExamples/TextBesideImage/test.html
00:05  riven: Well yeah, you'll have to vert center that too, then :)
00:09  racar: Hello folks
00:09  daviddoria: ah, got it - I see, I was not familiar with the display: table
00:09  daviddoria: so basically everyone say "bah don't use tables! use css!" but you are still allowed to use a "display: table"?  haha
00:10  zezikaro: is there an internal position for a div ?
00:10  zezikaro: so if an image is placed at 0,0 i want it to start at -20,-20 etc
00:10  zezikaro: without affecting where the div is in regards to the window position
00:10  zezikaro: just the content of the div
00:11  racar: I got a weird behavior in IE8 and opera. I Got a list ( ul - li ) and  its like its going in all the same line. If i put a "inputbox" in the li , its fine.  I got the url if anyone want to take a look.
00:20  freedrull: do i need to use blueprint...
00:21  daviddoria: riven: thanks for the link/help, it's working
00:21  racar: For a better example : http://www.webdevout.net/test?0S&raw , IF you open in opera or ie8 , you'll its on the same line ... on FF or chrome , on separate line. If anyone have a idea ..
00:21  riven: daviddoria: cool
00:21  riven: daviddoria: and yes, CSS tables are still styling - no (wrong) semantics
00:22  daviddoria: ok

00:41  kaervek: Anyone mind taking a look here and giving a suggestion on how to get my lists to lie farther away from my Table of Contents / "Reading Tips" divs?  They're floated, so I suspect that's the problem.

00:41  kaervek: it's happening on only a few articles.
00:42  kaervek: I'd rather not have to go back and re-structure them all
