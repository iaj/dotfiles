12:59  Arimil: is it possible to put a 1px border around all text of a certain color?
13:00  Arimil: Hm, bad way to word that. Is it possible to put a 1px border around text.
13:00  ZombieLoffe: Uh. That doesn't really make sense, Arimil... you style _elements_ not pieces of text
13:00  eighty4: you can put a 1px border around <p> if you want
13:01  eighty4: and you could give the p a class, like p.important { border: 1px solid red;}
13:01  Arimil: Yeah, thus my problem I want to put say a 1px white border around a bunch of text so that if black text ends up on a black background it's still readable.
13:02  Arimil: Wouldn't that just put a red box around <p> though?
13:02  Arimil: I want it to border the text.
13:02  Arimil: Maybe I'll be able to do it with javascript.
13:04  ZombieLoffe: Oh, right
13:04  ZombieLoffe: Arimil, text-shadow
13:05  ZombieLoffe: Or even more fitting, text-outline
13:05  Aleoss: ZombieLoffe: Also keep in mind that some more primitive browsers (specificially older cellphone ones) don't support text-shadow
13:05  ZombieLoffe: Unsupported in IE
13:05  ZombieLoffe: why are you telling me, Aleoss?
13:05  Aleoss: ZombieLoffe: In case you weren't aware as you failed to mention that cautionary.
13:06  NoCode: how can I make an element with 100% of the width of my page? I was "width: 100%;" but it's still leaving an around around it white.
13:07  Arimil: Hm, but they support text-outline?
13:07  Aleoss: NoCode: html, body { margin:0px; padding: 0px; }
13:08  Aleoss: Arimil: text-outline isn't supported in IE as ZombieLoffe said, as well it isn't supported in primitive browsers as well.
13:08  ZombieLoffe: NoCode, reset default margins and paddings -- margin: 0; padding: 0; -- you should do that for all elements, including body and html
13:09  riven: s/all elements/all elements except form controls/
13:09  ZombieLoffe: indeed
13:09  NoCode: Aleoss, ZombieLoffe: thanks
13:09  Arimil: Aleoss: Hm, http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/pr_outline.asp says it works in IE.
13:09  Aleoss: Arimil: NEVER use W3Schools.
13:09  Arimil: D:
13:10  Aleoss: Arimil: W3Schools != W3C. Do not be confused. W3Schools doesn't use correct information.
13:10  ZombieLoffe: Arimil, outline and text-outline are two different properties.
13:10  ZombieLoffe: Arimil, one puts an outline inside the element's boundaries, the other puts outline on the text itself.
13:11  ZombieLoffe: and w3schools is shit, yeah.
13:11 --- xcarm is now known as xc3rm
13:11  Arimil: Yeah, however there's documentation there. Good documentation at that. But I guess I'll just have to take that info for what it is, if it's not accurate info.
13:12  Arimil: ZombieLoffe: which being which lol? outline = text?
13:12  Aleoss: Arimil: Use proper syntax by the spec.
13:12  ZombieLoffe: Arimil: Are you serious?
13:12 --- xc3rm is now known as xcrm
13:12 --- xcrm is now known as xcarm
13:12  riven: Aleoss: inaccurate info is good documentation? Fail.
13:12  ZombieLoffe: Arimil: There's two properties, outline and text-outline and you're asking me which concerns text..?
13:12  riven: err
13:12  riven: Arimil: ^
13:13  Arimil: ZombieLoffe: I thought you were reffering to the difference between text-shadow and text-outline.
13:13  ZombieLoffe: Arimil: No. You linked to a page concerning the ´outline´ property, which has nothing to do with what we were talking about. I was referring to that.
13:14  Arimil: ZombieLoffe: oh I didn't even notice taht

21:29  sahilsk: I've a div with position :fixed applied to it. Now problem is, its position is different in IE and other browsers.
21:29  sahilsk: how can I solve this ?
21:30 --- Channel #css was synced in 127 seconds
21:31  Minty: In firefox, i.e & opera, there is no gap between my main content and the sidebar: http://adamcunnington.net/ i don't understand why because if i remove the sidebar, the margin-right property of the content works fine, i'm thinking it has something to do with the sidebar floating?
21:31  monokrome: I see a gap in firefox
21:32  Minty: to the right of the content?
21:32  Minty: between the content and the sidebar
21:32  monokrome: indeed
21:33  monokrome: Want a screenshot?
21:33  Minty: http://screencast.com/t/4Q4SnHvI1x
21:33  monokrome: oh
21:34  Minty: you see a gap there?
21:34  monokrome: "between the content and the sidebar" might not have been the best way to explain that
21:34  Minty: really? i thought that was quite obvious :) sorry though
21:34  Minty: oh, you interpreted side bar as the side-bar as in the line on the side of the page?
21:34  monokrome: you have margin-right: 0.3em
21:35  monokrome: maybe you want: margin: 0 0.3em;
21:35  Minty: yea, works fine in chrome / safari
21:35  Minty: that's the same thing...
21:35  Minty: surely?
21:35  monokrome: nope
21:35  Minty: how so?
21:35  monokrome: because that also does margin-left.
21:35  Minty: yea
21:35  Minty: i have margin-left set aswell
21:35  Minty: for the content
21:35  Minty: i don't want to give the sidebar a margin-left
21:35  monokrome: Not for the sidebar.
21:35  monokrome: ok
21:35  Minty: a number of people have suggested that
21:35  monokrome: then give it's wrapper padding
21:36  Minty: but, i don't understand why it doens't work?
21:36  Minty: if i gave the sidebar a margin-left, it fixes it
21:36  monokrome: yes
21:36  Minty: but the idea of my design is not all pages have a sidebar, so even if the sidebar doesn't exist, the spacing should be the same
21:36  monokrome: because it doesn't have a margin on the left.
21:36  monokrome: That's why it doesn't have a margin on the elft.
21:36  monokrome: left*
21:36  Minty: yea but the content has a margin-right
21:36  Minty: chrome and safari display it correctly
21:37  monokrome: Well, if the sidebar doesn't exist then adding margin-left to the sidebar wont cause any issues.
21:37  monokrome: and it probably wont break it in chrome/safari because it'll probably collapse the margins
21:37  Minty: no that's not the issue
21:37  monokrome: I think
21:37  monokrome: You just said that was the issue.
21:37  Minty: but i need to give content a margin-right because when a sidebar doesn't exist, i stil want a gap on the right hand side
21:38  monokrome: Leave the margin right.
21:38  monokrome: Add a margin left to the sidebar.
21:38 * monokrome never said to remove the margin right on content
21:38  Minty: if i do your way, correct: it won't be a problem if it doesn't exist, but if it does, then the spacing between the content and sidebar will be twice as much in chrome!
21:38  Minty: but the spacing will be 2x as much then...
21:38  monokrome: Test it. Maybe they'll collapse the margins.
21:39  Minty: nope
21:39  Minty: just tried it
21:39  monokrome: hmm
21:39  Minty: i don't see logically why it doesn't work
21:39  Minty: this makes no sense, if i can work out WHY the browsers are not liking it, then i can logically fix it
21:40  Minty: but the content should have a right margin and the content has no explicitally declared width, so why an earth are elements along side it - floating or not ignoring this margin?!
21:42  monokrome: no idea.
21:42  monokrome: I'd try wrapping it in #sidebar-wrapper
21:42  monokrome: and giving that padding
21:42  Minty: yea, i know ways to get around it
21:42  monokrome: Padding will just get in the way though
21:42  monokrome: hmm
21:42  Minty: but i refuse to do things that are hacky / unnecessary
21:42  Minty: there is always a way :) a third option! to solve things logically
21:42  Minty: and i'm determined
21:42  monokrome: oksushi might know. He knows everything.
21:43 * monokrome pokes oksushi 
21:43  oksushi: g'morning
21:43  monokrome: hello :)
21:43  Minty: oksushi: If you could help, that'd be pretty amazing :). Basically: http://adamcunnington.net - the issue is that there is no gap between the main content and the sidebar div
21:43  Minty: the content has a margin-right set which chrome/safari have no problem with but the other browsers are not showing this margin
21:44  monokrome: the sidebar is overlapping #content's margin
21:44  Minty: the idea of the design is that not all pages will have a sidebar and so the spacing to the right of the content needs to be local to the content div, not the sidebar
21:44  oksushi: you should put the margin on the sidebar, and put 'overflow: hidden' on the content div
21:45  oksushi: …which you have
21:45  monokrome: oksushi: he can't do that because some pages need the margin without the sidebar's existance
21:45  oksushi: but yeah, add an appropriate margin-left to the sidebar
21:45 * monokrome thinks he needs to make a sidebar wrapper with padding
21:46  oksushi: right now the margin on the content div is pushing against nothing, as the sidebar is removed from the normal document flow by virtue of its float
21:46  Minty: well chrome / safari have no problem with this
21:47  Minty: i can't give the sidebar a margin-left because then the spacing between the content div and the sidebar div is 2x
21:47  Minty: the content needs a margin-right to maintain the gap when there is no sidebar
21:49  monokrome: What's wrong with giving your sidebar a wrapper?
21:49  Minty: that's unnecessary
21:49  Minty: and illogical
21:49  Radiant: hello guys
21:49  monokrome: sometimes browser issues make the illogical necessary.
21:50  monokrome: hello Radiant 
21:50  Radiant: i need some help
21:50  monokrome: nice.
21:50  Radiant: i'm making a gallery-like website
21:50  Radiant: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6767207/SimpleRatings/index.html
21:50  Radiant: there it is
21:50  Radiant: now...
21:51  oksushi: Minty: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0v&raw
21:51  Radiant: is there a way to make it look the same way it looks like right now, except to make the last row aligned left
21:51  Radiant: ?
21:51  Radiant: i tried floating it left
21:51  Minty: oksushi: i know that... but if the sidebar is removed, there is no gap to the right of the content div...
21:52  oksushi: Minty: yes, there is
21:52  oksushi: try it
21:52  Radiant: but then the item container can't be centered
21:52  Minty: oksushi: ok there is... but only cus of the padding of body
21:52  Minty: that's a simple example: in mine, i don't have a wrapper that holds side & content
21:52  oksushi: yes, and that is the point. You are over-coplicating things
21:52  monokrome: What's wrong with that?
21:52  Radiant: essentially i want something like this: http://grid-based.com/ but with the image container centered on any sreen resolution
21:53  Minty: i'm not overcomplicating it at all - i'm undercomplicating it!
21:53  Minty: i don't want another div
21:53  Minty: that can't be the only way of solving a problem
21:53  monokrome: I meant oksushi's solution
21:53  Minty: yea, oksushi's is basically an analogy of using a wrapper
21:53  Minty: in his example, the body is the wrapper
21:53  monokrome: yes
21:53  Minty: in mine, there is no wrapper that ONLY encases content & sidebar that i can apply padding to
21:53  monokrome: That's what you will need to do in the end.
21:53  Radiant: anyone knows is it possible?
21:53  oksushi: Minty: you already have #page…
21:54  oksushi: just use that, silly
21:54  Minty: no, i can't
21:54  Minty: #page encases the header and footer
21:54  oksushi: …yes, you can
21:54  oksushi: so?
21:54  Minty: nope, because then the header border-bottom won't reach the sides of the page div
21:54  Minty: if i give it padding
21:54  oksushi: they can have negative margins to pull themselves over the padding, yo
21:54  Minty: negative margins = hacky
21:54  oksushi: …
21:54  monokrome: haha
21:54  oksushi: hacky my ass
21:55  Minty: in this context, it's hacky
21:55  monokrome: then get the footer out of page
21:55  oksushi: it seems like you are the your own greatest barrier to achieving your goals
21:55  monokrome: or add a content wrapper like is standardly done
21:55  Minty: it's illogical to give a wrapper padding and then tell an embedded element to ignore the padding
21:55 * oksushi sighs
21:55  Minty: logically: if you're going to do that: that element should not exist within the wrapper
21:55  Minty: sorry, i'm big on doing things semantically
21:56  Minty: the entire reason why there are so many horrible websites out there is down to hacky workarounds because of stupid browser incompatibility
21:56  oksushi: and you think that my solution isn't 'semantic'? 
21:56  oksushi: this has nothing to do with semantics
21:56  monokrome: it's more semantic
21:56  Minty: telling an element to have a negative margin to accomodate for padding
21:56  Minty: can not be the best way :|
21:56  oksushi: that has NOTHING to do with semantics
21:56  Minty: ok, call it what u like but still, don't you see where i'm coming from?
21:57  monokrome: oksushi: adding a wrapper for the content (#content) and naming the content something a bit more semantic would only help with semantics. Not detor from them.
21:57  monokrome: Then you can have header, content, and footer in your #page
21:58  Minty: and then on the pages where there is no sidebar
21:58  Minty: content will be wrapped by a div that does nothing but provide padding
21:58  monokrome: then you'll have padding on #content
21:58  Minty: that is not logical in the slightest. waste of a div
22:00  monokrome: Stop being stuborn and you'll find use in it.
22:00  monokrome: Keep being stuborn, and you'll find no resolution.
22:00  Minty: nope
22:00  monokrome: Your choice :)
22:00  Radiant: yo guys
22:00  Minty: keep being stubborn and i'll waste time but eventually find a solution that is 100% logical and requires no hacky work around for stupid incompatible browsers
22:01  monokrome: Well, when you do - let me know.
22:01  Radiant: does anyone know a solution to my problem? :(
22:01  oksushi: Radiant: put a width on the container, centre that, then align the items to th eleft
22:01  Radiant: i want it to take the whole screen space
22:02  Radiant: no matter what the resolution
22:02  Radiant: if i put width on container, it's no longer liquid design
22:02  Radiant: :-/
22:03  Minty: the width doesn't have to be absolute
22:03  oksushi: Radiant: your alternative is to remove the text-align: center; from #items
22:05  Radiant: hmm
22:14  Radiant: it won't center
22:14  Radiant: not without text-align: center
22:14  Radiant: :(
22:16  ZombieLoffe: whut
22:16  Radiant: fucking css, how does it work :-/
22:16  ZombieLoffe: haha
22:16  Radiant: :'(
22:17  Radiant: i'm having nightmares here... and you're laughing
22:17  ZombieLoffe: Radiant, what's your problem?
22:17  Radiant: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6767207/SimpleRatings/index.html
22:17  Radiant: i want this gallery centered like it is now
22:17  Radiant: but i need the last row aligned left
22:18  Radiant: apparently, it's impossible to do
22:18  ZombieLoffe: yup, pretty much
22:19  Radiant: :(
22:19  ZombieLoffe: you want it center and left aligned at the same time... pretty trippy
22:19  Radiant: i want the UL centered
22:20  Radiant: and the LI's aligned left
22:20  ZombieLoffe: so just do text-align: left; on the <ul>s
22:20  Radiant: it should look like this: http://grid-based.com/
22:20  Radiant: but the whole thing should be centered
22:20  ZombieLoffe: It is centered
22:20  ZombieLoffe: lawl
22:20  Radiant: it's not
22:21  ZombieLoffe: try reducing the screen width on http://grid-based.com/
22:21  Radiant: change the resolution a bit
22:21  Radiant: yeah
22:21  ZombieLoffe: Now you're doing it again
22:21  Radiant: there's whitespace on the right when you reduce it
22:21  ZombieLoffe: you're inadvertantly saying you want it centered and left-aligned at the same time
22:21  Radiant: :-/
22:21  ZombieLoffe: the <ul> will be centered, its children will not be, with text-align left
22:22  Radiant: hmm
22:22  ZombieLoffe: Skeleton jelly, bro.
22:23 --- squiggy_ is now known as squiggy
22:28  Radiant: ZombieLoffe: http://www.twiddla.com/428277
22:30  ZombieLoffe: Radiant, what you want is that the items be left-aligned according to the left edge of the centered list items
22:30  ZombieLoffe: Not the left edge of the <ul>
22:30  Radiant: :-/
22:30  ZombieLoffe: it might be doable with JavaScript, you'd have to do some fancy calculations
22:31  monokrome: why not in css?
22:31  ZombieLoffe: but if you ask me, it's not worth it. Either left-align and accept the white-space on the right sides, or center-align and accept the last row being centered
22:31  Radiant: :'(
22:31  Radiant: shiiit
22:32  ZombieLoffe: monokrome, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6767207/SimpleRatings/index.html -- he wants the last item to be left-aligned, so to speak.
22:32  Radiant: monokrome: http://www.twiddla.com/428277
22:32  ZombieLoffe: Or rather, the last _row_, and it can be any number of items
22:35  Radiant: hmm
22:35  Radiant: i was thinking..
22:35  Radiant: would centering it in HTML fix it?
22:37  ZombieLoffe: That doesn't really make sense.
22:37  Radiant: meh... tried... it's same
22:37  Radiant: fuck css
22:37  Radiant: ...
22:38  Radiant: this problem seems pretty basic, yet it's unsolvable
22:38  ZombieLoffe: Tsk tsk.
22:38  Radiant: zed shaw is right
22:38  Radiant: ...
22:38  oksushi: Radiant: maybe you need to rethink your 'design'
22:38  Radiant: :-/
22:39  Radiant: i don't know... my goal is really to put as many items on one page
22:39  riven: lol @ tagging all children of a list with the same class
22:40  Radiant: o_O
22:40  Radiant: whaddya mean? i don't have to do that?
22:40 * riven facepalms
22:40  Radiant: oh...
22:40  Radiant: lol
22:40  Radiant: yeah
22:40  Radiant: xD
22:40  riven: #items > li derp
22:40  ZombieLoffe: Left-aligning objects in a container is easy. Center-aligning the container is easy. Centering the objects in relation to the width of the container is easy. What you're asking about is how to align the items to the left-most position of a grid made up of center-aligned objects... it's not a complicated request.
22:41  Radiant: yyy...
22:41  ZombieLoffe: er
22:41  ZombieLoffe: It's a simple request, rather
22:41  ZombieLoffe: heh.
22:42  Radiant: ZombieLoffe: so, it can be done?
22:42  Radiant: o_O
22:42  ZombieLoffe: It's not a simple request*. God, I fail.
22:42  Radiant: hahaha
22:42  Radiant: xD
22:42  ZombieLoffe: Sorry to get your hopes up. No, at least I can't figure out a way.
22:43  monokrome: aside from positioning
22:43  monokrome: :/
22:43  Radiant: i'll have to learn javascript then...
22:43  monokrome: are you trying to make a grid use space more efficiently?
22:43  Radiant: yes!
22:43  monokrome: There's a jQuery plugin that does that rather magnificently
22:43  Radiant: to use as much space as possible
22:44 * monokrome tries to remember what it was called
22:44  riven: FWIW, this is a problem known to be unsolvable with current CSS.
22:44  riven: So don't even bother.
22:44  riven: Js or accept it.
22:44  Radiant: ok
22:44  Radiant: i presumed so
22:44  Radiant: monokrome: i'll wait for you to recall its name...
22:46  riven: Shrink-wrapping boxes will always expand to the maximum width of the container when wrapping occurs within, CSS specifies this algorithm exactly like that.
22:47 * monokrome isn't having much luck
22:48  ZombieLoffe: Something with ´grid´ in the title, presumably.
22:48  Radiant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/159025/jquery-grid-recommendations  ?
22:49  riven: jQuery + a plugin *just* to fix this?
22:49  riven: whoa.
22:49  Radiant: well,  i would use it for more things anyway...
22:49  riven: mkay :)
22:55  monokrome: Radiant: None of those plugins are the one that I'm talking about, but maybe those will work
22:55  monokrome: Radiant: And don't get too excited with it... Remember to make sure things still work with Javascript off :D
22:56  Radiant: monokrome: ok, thanks for the advice :D
22:56  monokrome: It's called
22:56  monokrome: jQuery Masonry
22:57 * monokrome googles to verify
22:57  oksushi: monokrome: that moves things 'up'
22:57  monokrome: http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry/
22:57  Radiant: monokrome: omg, excellent, thanks!
22:57  monokrome: oksushi: What?
22:58  chrislabeard: is there a fix for the Firefox overflow print issue?
22:59  Radiant: this is pretty much what i want: http://www.puma.com/running/media
22:59  ZombieLoffe: Except that page has a fixed width.
22:59  azazul: since when people are unable to do simple css without use of javascript ... 
22:59  azazul: or that perversion the call 'jquery '
23:00  ZombieLoffe: This isn't simple CSS, azazul. What he's asking for can't be done with CSS.
23:00 * monokrome thnks that azazul might be a bit biased without reason
23:00  riven: no he's right, jQuery is an abomination. :p
23:00  oksushi: monokrome: masonry pushes things 'up' to fill in space
23:00  oksushi: h8rz!
23:00  monokrome: oksushi: yep
23:00  ZombieLoffe: h8rz gon h8 amirite
23:01  azazul: omg .. riven agreed with me 
23:01 * azazul checks the sky .. nope .. no fire and brimstone
23:01  riven: Radiant: are the boxes always the same width?
23:01  monokrome: haha
23:01  monokrome: riven: Still no reasoning presented for your opinion.
23:02  Radiant: riven: yeah
23:02  ZombieLoffe: If you're gonna gripe about jquery, take it somewhere else. It's off-topic.
23:03  azazul: so why dont you float the columns at first and then fill in the "blocks" ,  Radiant
23:03  monokrome: azazul: What he is trying to do can't be done in CSS
23:03  riven: Radiant: if so, it's _super_ simple: get #items width, get a box' width, divide #items width by box width and floor. Multiply box width by the result. Subtract the result from #items width, divide by two. Set the result as the left margin of #items. :)
23:03  azazul: it would make it a hell easier to do the JS later 
23:03  Radiant: azazul: because there's whitespace on the right when i do that
23:04  azazul: no, there isnt 
23:04  Radiant: riven: isn't that javascript again?
23:04  riven: no, that's pascal!
23:04  Radiant: -_-
23:04  azazul: Radiant: netvibes does it , bbc.co.uk does it .. so .. what makes you special ?
23:04  oksushi: Radiant: you could achieve some approximation of what you want using media queries
23:05  oksushi: but, that would require some SEVERE level of OCD
23:05  riven: oh hey, you're right.. CSS *can* do it!
23:06  riven: just need a different style rule for every horizontal res increase of <box width> :)
23:06  monokrome: :|
23:07  monokrome: hackhack
23:07  azazul: monokrome: you cant trust JS 
23:07  azazul: ever
23:07  monokrome: azazul: I don't.
23:07  azazul: whenever there is a way to avoid dependency on JS , you should at least try
23:08  monokrome: I build all my sites without CSS first. Test in a text browser. Add CSS. Test CSS. Add layout-based Javascript.
23:08  azazul: even if it is just a 'ok .. it kinda looks like what i want , but it isnt exactly' 
23:08  monokrome: Thanks for the lesson in common sense.
23:08 * monokrome wasn't the one that recommended JS in the first place

23:33  chrislabeard: How can I get this page to print correctly in FF ? http://wgtncty.ideasbynature.com/park-campground

23:36  chrislabeard: being overflow:hidden 
23:36  nkuttler: chrislabeard: stop guessing, fix the code, /topic
23:40  mephux: anyone know how ti fix this? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38088/Screen%20shot%202010-11-05%20at%206.39.21%20PM.png
23:40  preaction: what's broken?
23:40  mephux: the dropdown menu gets cut off by the parent div.. any way to make sure that will always overflow escape 
23:41  mephux: z-index does not seem to fix it
23:41  preaction: you need to allow overflow. overflow: show
23:41  mephux: on the parent?
23:42  ZombieLoffe: visible, not show
23:44  mephux: ZombieLoffe: i have that and shit will get cut off
23:45  mephux: it will work if i take overflow hidden of the parent div but then it wont hold the content
23:45  ZombieLoffe: I'm guessing you're using overflow: hidden; to contain floats, then...

23:46  riven: use an alternative method ^
23:46  riven: or, if it's for float containment alone, you can also use the :after clearing method
