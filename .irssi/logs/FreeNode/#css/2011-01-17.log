00:00  dhaivat: hello everyone. Here's my website: http://falling-mist-375.heroku.com/posts It works fine in FF, but not so in IE, why so? (you can see the source with ctrl+u)
00:02  Madmartigan: dhaivat: do you realize there are 2 stylesheets with 404s?
00:03  orflon: Madmartigan,  you mean just, margin: 50% auto?
00:03  orflon: or auto 50%?
00:03  Madmartigan: X represents top margin
00:04  Madmartigan: where are you getting 50%?
00:04  orflon: Madmartigan,  so what should I put for top margin? I don't know the exact value.
00:05  Madmartigan: what? the top margin will be whatever value you tell it.
00:06  orflon: ok if I put: 0px auto, should it place it in the center?
00:06  orflon: it doesn't :/
00:06  Madmartigan: you have to set the width as well
00:07  piklu: is there some workalohalic kind of person here ? I need to ask something, please respond if u think u are always doing work
00:07  orflon: Madmartigan,  width of the parent?
00:07 --- oojacoboo_ is now known as oojacoboo
00:07  Madmartigan: no, of the image
00:09  orflon: Madmartigan,  you mean in the img tag, or in css?
00:09  webben: piklu: I'm fairly workaholic.
00:09  piklu: webben: would like to pm u, can i?
00:09  Madmartigan: orflon: css goes in the css
00:09  webben: piklu: If you like.
00:10  orflon: Madmartigan,  if put: margin:0px auto; width:90px;, is that fine? Still doesn't work.
00:10  orflon: s/if/I've
00:11  astropirate: could someone please give me some advice on this page? http://ruseops.com/   it looks kinda tacky...
00:11  Madmartigan: if you can put together a proper test case i will take a look, you might want to try the text-align:center method, as setting width to images in css is a pain

08:54  oksushi: iaj: you are just limiting it with the parent <div> element
08:55  oksushi: so why not put the margin on /that/ instead?
08:55  Aque0s: hey everyone, i have a problem that seems to be specific to google chrome. brightweights.com displays perfectly in ie and firefox, but in chrome there is a white bar, maybe 5px between the center and top frames.... could anyone tell me how to fix it?
08:56  oksushi: Aque0s: a) you are missing a doctype b) frames? serious? frames?

08:59  b0x_: oksushi: perhaps a simpler explanation?
09:00  oksushi: you can't read?
09:00  b0x_: anyone else?
09:00  oksushi: how do you use IRC then?
09:00  oksushi: if you are too lazy to read the above URL for the answer, there is no hope for you
09:01  oksushi: or, take the search term I just used, and plug it into google
09:01  b0x_: clearly i read it, it didn't ring any bells which is OBVIOUSLY why i asked for a simpler explanation
09:01  b0x_: i don't need criticism or any negativity, if you dont wanna help me. fine.
09:01  oksushi: you duid not read it
09:01  b0x_: i read some ofi t
09:01  b0x_: the key parts.
09:01  oksushi: you opened it, didn't see an immediate answer, then bitched in here
09:01  joeyaa: lol
09:01  envrion: lol
09:01  b0x_: wrong.
09:01  b0x_: that's entirely presumptuous.
09:01  oksushi: you, sir, are wrong
09:01  b0x_: i am not :)
09:02  oksushi: unless you are a world champion speed reader
09:02  b0x_: but! i will read it. all of it
09:02  oksushi: there is no way you took the time to ingest that information, think about it, and apply the learnings to your particular situation
09:02  b0x_: just to satisfy you. but i'm pretty sure i will still require direction
09:02  b0x_: so brb
09:02  envrion: I doubt you'll get it with that attitude
09:03  b0x_: what attitude?
09:03  wathek: oksushi, it's valid http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://solutions30.gedeom.com/&charset=(detect+automatically)&doctype=Inline&group=0&user-agent=W3C_Validator/1.1

09:04  wathek: oksushi, but still cannot see what I've to do to get the menu working for IE8
09:04  wathek: :(
09:04  b0x_: envrion, oksushi: i realize if you did help me, it would be of your own free will/consideration and i respect that, and that's why i'm going to read all of it and search for more information, but i'm pretty sure i know what is going to help me and what isn't. according to oksushi, the topic is 'collapsing margins' -- so i will search. just hoped there was an easier way.
09:04  b0x_: friggin cynics. i swear.
09:04  oksushi: wathek: describe the issue? I don't have IE here

09:07  aga|noob: ummm
09:08  aga|noob: is there a way to make background images stretch to the size of the element?
09:08 --- aga|noob is now known as Agamemnus
09:08  oksushi: Agamemnus: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-size
09:09  Agamemnus: new question
09:09  Agamemnus: is there a way to make IE care?
09:09  oksushi: no
09:09  Agamemnus: I set the size to 100% 100%
09:09  Agamemnus: IE doesn't care
09:10  Agamemnus: it just does its thing
09:10  b0x_: oksushi: tell me if i'm on the right path? is it because i have set no padding/margin in that div, but <p> (inside that div) has padding by default?
09:10  dumont: please show me how to make the div displaying white background expand so as to cause the footer to hit the bottom of the viewport http://www.webdevout.net/test?01e , the intention is to have the #contents and #nav_expand expand to fill the page all the way down until the text in the contents fits
09:10  oksushi: b0x_: has /margin/ by default, but yeah
09:10  b0x_: yea, margin. that's what i said.
09:10  b0x_: :D
09:10  oksushi: it 'breaks out of' the parent element, pushing it away from the top
09:10  b0x_: ok
09:10  oksushi: you can 'contain' the margin with some techniques
09:11  b0x_: would <p style="margin:0"></p> work
09:11  oksushi: yes, but that would be silly
09:11  b0x_: hmm
09:12  oksushi: you may like to read the other url i just posted
09:12  Agamemnus: can anyone help me here....
09:12  Agamemnus: I seem to be failing.
09:13  b0x_: i will. i'm crappy with CSS. i understand some of it, but i suck at positioning
09:13  oksushi: b0x_: no positioning is required
09:13  oksushi: Agamemnus: I just gave you the answer…
09:13  Agamemnus: i know you did
09:13  b0x_: i know, i'm just saying in general
09:13  Agamemnus: but it doesn't work in IE
09:13  Agamemnus: and i have more problems
09:13  oksushi: then rethink your 'requirements'
09:14  Agamemnus: is it not going to work in IE?
09:14  Agamemnus: or am I doing it wrong?
09:14  oksushi: no. background-size is not supported in IE. Probably will be supported in IE9.
09:14  Agamemnus: welll
09:15  Agamemnus: it was suggested that I use background-images to fix another problem I had with IE
09:15  Agamemnus: but now, that doesn't work, and the non-IE browsers have the same original problem.
09:15  Agamemnus: my original problem is that, when I use display:none for an element, IE doesn't register the mouseover
09:15  Agamemnus: or the click
09:15  Agamemnus: or anything
09:16  Agamemnus: even for visibility:hidden
09:16  Agamemnus: it doesn't register anything
09:16  Agamemnus: is there any way around this?
09:16  oksushi: sounds like a js issue
09:16  Agamemnus: no
09:16  oksushi: ask ##javascript
09:16  Agamemnus: in pure css
09:16  Agamemnus: using an href
09:16  Agamemnus: it won't register
09:16  oksushi: url?
09:16  Agamemnus: let me rework it to what it was..
09:17  Agamemnus: if i can :\
09:18  Agamemnus: i don't really remember what I had
09:18  Agamemnus: so maybe this won't work at all
09:18  oksushi: o_O
09:18  Agamemnus: Hi, Maurice (J?)
09:19  wathek: oksushi, here it is http://wathek.org/files/captureIE.png
09:21  Agamemnus: nope, it's not working in Firefox or IE.
09:21  Agamemnus: but it did
09:21  Agamemnus: here's what I have in the css file:
09:21  Agamemnus: a {display: none;}
09:21  Agamemnus: a:hover {display: block;}
09:21  Agamemnus: I think i need a few more things
09:21  Agamemnus: it's <a>s wrapping <img>
09:21  Agamemnus: I need the img to disappear unless it's hovered
09:22  Agamemnus: here's the site:
09:22  Agamemnus: double u double u double u merchantsofpower dot com
09:29  Maurice: Agamemnus: no ;)
09:29  joeyaa: i really really want to click that url
09:31  joeyaa: a > img { display none; } a:hover > img { display:inline; }
09:31  joeyaa: ?
09:34  Agamemnus: hi
09:34  Agamemnus: umm
09:34  Agamemnus: i figured it out,
09:34  Agamemnus: it should be:
09:35  Agamemnus: a img {display: none;}
09:35  Agamemnus: a:hover img {display: inline}
09:35  Agamemnus: That still does not fix it in IE.
09:35  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: No Maurice and myself are not the same person.
09:35  Agamemnus: In IE, the hover does not activate.
09:35  Agamemnus: Ooo
09:35  Agamemnus: Hello, MauriceJ
09:35  b0x_: can anyone tell me why the words "entry" surpasses the height of the container div? www.amernix.com/test
09:36  joeyaa: Agamemnus: that's exactly what i just said^ ^_^
09:36  Agamemnus: oh ..
09:37  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: Greetz
09:37  Agamemnus: b0x: overflow, you didn't set it.. maybe
09:37  joeyaa: Agamemnus: the ie part is how ie is, it only accepts hover on anchors
09:37  b0x_: oh?
09:37  joeyaa: you can js bind an event handler (e.g. jquery) if you wanted to
09:38  Agamemnus: crap.
09:38  Agamemnus: so it was suggested to me to use background images on <a>
09:38  Agamemnus: but they don't resize in IE.
09:38  Agamemnus: what do I do?
09:39  Agamemnus: it's not just hover
09:39  Agamemnus: it's also mouseover, i think
09:39  Agamemnus: my initial code involves javascript doing the same thing
09:40  b0x_: well, Agamemnus..that works
09:40  b0x_: i'm an idiot.
09:40  Agamemnus: i'm glad i could help
09:40  Agamemnus: usually i never help
09:41  b0x_: Agamemnus: any idea why the pattern? you see how the words aren't lined up?
09:43  Agamemnus: umm
09:43  Agamemnus: which words?
09:43  b0x_: Entry
09:43  Agamemnus: they are all lined up for me
09:44  Agamemnus: in firefox
09:44  b0x_: erm
09:44  b0x_: im using firefox, they aren't lined up
09:44  b0x_: hold on, screenshot
09:44  b0x_: wait, they are lined up for me in firefox..not in chrome
09:44  b0x_: doh.
09:46  Agamemnus: joeyaa, are you still there?
09:46  Agamemnus: I used this:
09:46  Agamemnus: http://www.xs4all.nl/~peterned/csshover.html
09:46  Agamemnus: but it still doesn't work
09:46  Agamemnus: is that not the problem?
09:47  Agamemnus: b0x, checking
09:48  Agamemnus: b0x.
09:48  Agamemnus: chrome considers the " " as part of the text.
09:48  joeyaa: that's gross
09:48  joeyaa: behavior:
09:48  Agamemnus: firefox trims the " ".
09:49  Agamemnus: you have "Entry <br />" on half your entries
09:49  Agamemnus: and "Entry<br />" on the other half.
09:49  b0x_: well no wonder, beat me down with socks
09:49  Agamemnus: i will. al gore's sox.
09:50  Agamemnus: al gore ('s sox) rox your sox.
09:50  Agamemnus: i wish my problem was so easy ;)
09:50  b0x_: i normally dont make mistakes like this
09:50  b0x_: what problem?
09:51  Agamemnus: I don't really know
09:52  Agamemnus: joeyaa says "ie only accepts hover on anchors"
09:52  Agamemnus: but I tried to fix it, and it didn't work
09:52  Agamemnus: I did: "a img { behavior: url("csshover3.htc"); }"
09:52  Agamemnus: and that should have fixed it
09:53  joeyaa: the way you said that makes me think you didn't actually download the htc and upload it to the correct path
09:53  Agamemnus: it's there
09:53  Agamemnus: maybe it shouldn't be "a img"?
09:53  b0x_: what are you trying to do
09:53  b0x_: on hover, change to an image?
09:54  Agamemnus: yes.
09:54  Agamemnus: well
09:54  b0x_: for IE?
09:54  Agamemnus: on hover, change display to display:inline
09:54  Agamemnus: yeah.
09:54  Agamemnus: (and normally, use display:none)
09:55  Agamemnus: and yes
09:55  Agamemnus: i have "AddType text/x-component .htc"
09:56  b0x_: no idea
09:56  b0x_: but i guess if i really understood what you were trying to do, i MIGHT be able to help
09:56  b0x_: or find someone that can
09:56  b0x_: :D
09:57  casdf: hi, noob q here: in an element spec like     #cboxTopLeft{width:21px; height:21px; background:url(images/controls.png) no-repeat -100px 0;}, what are the last two?
09:57  Agamemnus: i told u
09:57  casdf: by that i mean the -100px and the 0.
09:57  Agamemnus: trying to hide the image unless it's moused over
09:57  b0x_: ohhh
09:57  b0x_: javascript?
09:57  Agamemnus: casdf: the last two are position offsets for the image
09:57  Agamemnus: i think
09:58  Agamemnus: moused over or hovered
09:58  joeyaa: background-position
09:58  b0x_: is the image also a link?
09:58  Agamemnus: yes.
09:59  casdf: Agamemnus: horiz then vert?
09:59  Agamemnus: joeyaa: but the fix should work in theory, right?
09:59  Agamemnus: casdf: yeah, i think so.. that is the standard
09:59  joeyaa: sorry didnt read what u said im writing down my hours for work and going to bed
09:59  casdf: again, total css noob here... i understand why separation of code and view and blah blah is good, but
10:00  casdf: i'm staring at this css file and i have no clue how the pieces are put together
10:00  Agamemnus: alright, i guess i will suffer, joey
10:00  Agamemnus: goodnight
10:00  joeyaa: casdf: shorthand css properties, do more write less be happy
10:00  Agamemnus: casdf, there are several forms for css
10:00  casdf: joeyaa: i am not writing any,
10:00  Agamemnus: that's what you're looking at
10:00  casdf: i am editing someone elses css to make it work for me
10:01  Agamemnus: it's "shorthand"
10:01  casdf: i mean, i understand it specs elements
10:01  Agamemnus: it defines a type of stuff all at once
10:01  casdf: and tells them where to go
10:01  joeyaa: casdf: i was explaining the purpose of shorthand
10:01  joeyaa: but with that, goodnight
10:01  casdf: i see
10:02  casdf: basically im editing a lightbox
10:02  casdf: and all i want to do is extend the total frame a bit. except the total frame is implicitly defined..
10:02  Agamemnus: # is a named object thingo.
10:02  casdf: no offense, but i don't require a course on css. I just need to find the right number to increment by 20 :D
10:02  b0x_: Agamemnus: so..the anchor is an image and you want it to be invisible until moused over?
10:02  casdf: or set of numbers...
10:03  Agamemnus: b0x, the <a> holds an <img>, and everything else is correct
10:03  Agamemnus: i want both to be invisible until moused over
10:03  Agamemnus: casdf: wasn't dreaming of it
10:03  casdf: aha, found the one
10:04  Agamemnus: b0x_: it's simple in theory but impossible in practice!
10:04  Agamemnus: At least FOR IE
10:04  Agamemnus: if (IE) {die();}
10:06  Lazylegs: Agamemnus, just to make myself clear.. you have a and img where.. and you want them both to be invisible before hovered over of it?
10:07  casdf: Agamemnus: thanks for the help
10:08 --- okaycool_ is now known as okaycool
10:08  Agamemnus: yes, or at least the one that matters
10:09  Agamemnus: sure, casdf.
10:09  Agamemnus: maybe my htc files are not working properly.
10:09  b0x_: Agamemnus: and when mouse off, disappear?
10:10  Agamemnus: yes
10:10  Agamemnus: mouse on, visible
10:10  Agamemnus: mouse off, disappear
10:11  Lazylegs: Agamemnus, obviously hovering over invisible item is pretty impossible. And anyways, how person would know where to hover?
10:12  Agamemnus: why is it impossible?
10:12  Agamemnus: the person will know, trust me.
10:12 * stickDeath bom dia / good morning
10:12  Agamemnus: it works in FF and any other non-IE browser
10:15  Lazylegs: not in webkit
10:17  Agamemnus: it works in chrome
10:17 --- BackBone is now known as Guest84501
10:17  Lazylegs: Oh well, does not make sense.. the user knows.. so apparently you are doing it for just one person.. but hidden navs and element that appear randomly hovering over them is just bad bad bad practice
10:17 --- Guest84501 is now known as BackBone
10:18  Agamemnus: it's not really hidden
10:18  Agamemnus: there's a background image with all the buttons in the off state
10:18  b0x_: Agamemnus: let me ask ya
10:18  Agamemnus: it's not a background image per-se
10:18  Agamemnus: just another image
10:19  Lazylegs:  Agamemnus, so this would work for you? http://www.webdevout.net/test?01j
10:20  Lazylegs: or that kind of solution
10:20  Lazylegs: if we think that 'hover me' is an button
10:20  Agamemnus: no, because the thing that appears IS the button
10:21  Agamemnus: unless
10:21  Agamemnus: if span is an empty sized box
10:21  Lazylegs: That was just an example
10:22  Agamemnus: there's only one problem
10:23  Agamemnus: two problems
10:23  b0x_: well i have no idea
10:23  windparadise: hello, pls how do I convert this to CSS ? <table width="" align="center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
10:23  Agamemnus: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01k
10:23  Agamemnus: first problem is the border
10:23  Agamemnus: second problem is that it keeps refreshing itself
10:23  Agamemnus: going in and out
10:23  windparadise: this comes after a posted add.
10:23  Agamemnus: in a loop
10:24  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: Are you looking to do something similar to an image map?
10:24  Agamemnus: yes, MauriceJ.
10:24  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: The modern way http://www.alistapart.com/articles/imagemap/
10:25  Agamemnus: the difference here is that the image clicked would change
10:25  Agamemnus: er, moused over
10:25  Agamemnus: sub-image.
10:26  Agamemnus: windparadise: dunno, give up and use tables.
10:26  b0x_: anyway, www.amernix.com/test -> how can i get Entry to be lined up with Submit, not Footer
10:26  Agamemnus: this is exactly what I need, MauriceJ
10:26  Agamemnus: thank you
10:27  Agamemnus: it doesn't line up with anything, b0x_.
10:27  b0x_: what?
10:27  b0x_: well, what im saying is..i want it to be on the same line as Submit
10:28  Agamemnus: you implied that it lines up with Footer
10:28  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: Happy to help, you're welcome.
10:28  b0x_: Agamemnus: my mistake.
10:29  Agamemnus: you can adjust the top position
10:29  Agamemnus: maybe margin-top.
10:29  Lazylegs: Agamemnus, if you use one image (sprite) you can position it with background-position. Feels bit that you are over complicatin simple stuff.. real example what you desire would be really great. As now are really relying on your explanation and for simpletons like me, can get mistrailed
10:30  Agamemnus: i just didn't want to explain it all again, so I got a bit mystical. My bad, too.
10:30  Agamemnus: the example is here:
10:30  Agamemnus: double u double u double u dot merchantsofpower dot com
10:30  Agamemnus: i can't use background-position though, as everything is stretched
10:31  Agamemnus: b0x_: negative margin top or negative top with a unit that's not px
10:31  Agamemnus: the other unit.
10:31  b0x_: Agamemnus: im sure it's got something to do with float
10:31  Agamemnus: forgot what it is called
10:31  Agamemnus: yes, position:float on it is what you'd do
10:31  Agamemnus: relative
10:31  Agamemnus: position:relative
10:31  Agamemnus: i think
10:32  Agamemnus: or i dunno, maybe float somewhere in there
10:32  Agamemnus: i'm not really comfortable with floats
10:32  Agamemnus: they scare me
10:32  MauriceJ: float is yor friend.
10:32  MauriceJ: s/yor/your/
10:34  Agamemnus: so just set a separate hover for each item
10:34  Lazylegs: Agamemnus, so on hover of the as an example the letter.. something should appear?
10:34  dumont: someone has any suggestions on how I could make 2 elastic equal height columns of variable length depending on the content inside one of the columns?
10:34  Agamemnus: it should light up
10:34  Agamemnus: and it'd be a link.
10:35  Agamemnus: like in firefox (works)
10:35  MauriceJ: dumont: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/
10:35  Lazylegs: dumont, this is one way http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight
10:35  MauriceJ: ]faux columns
10:35  _ZofBot4: faux columns: http://alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/
10:35  Lazylegs: thats another, ^^
10:36  Lazylegs: and if you do not care ie7 or 6.. display: table-cell for adjacent elements works too
10:36  MauriceJ: *Grumble*IE6*Murder*
10:38  Agamemnus: the effect is semi-ruined by bad rounding
10:38  Agamemnus: oh well
10:38  Agamemnus: dunno how to fix it
10:39  Agamemnus: but gotta fix in ie first
10:39  Agamemnus: and i don't think the htc stuff works
10:39  Agamemnus: so i guess i'll need to use individual background images
10:39  Agamemnus: errr
10:39  dumont: they all seem like half backed, half-ass solutions half of which don't work in half the browsers, the other half causes other problems in half the browsers like some kind of anchor problems with display:block
10:39  Agamemnus: indiiwait a second
10:40  Agamemnus: yeah, MauriceJ
10:40  Agamemnus: Your solution won't work!! :(:(:(
10:40  Agamemnus: actually dumont, it's just IE.
10:40  Agamemnus: MauriceJ: It needs to resize, and background images won't resize in IE.
10:42  MauriceJ: Agamemnus: Hrm... I am stumped for the moment, then.
10:42  dumont: what I'm trying to do is making a frame that can expand both width and height wise, using 1 horizontal expander and 1 vertical expander, why is it so hard to make? it should be one of the most common things out there
10:42  dumont: btw, those expanders are sandwidched in the middle of the page between fixed size slices/divs
10:43  dumont: which complete the frame
10:43  Agamemnus: Worst comes to worst, I will do something special for IE, like remove the light-up
10:49  Agamemnus: what is that css junk that only ie understands?
10:49  JDigital: * html #whatever {}
10:50  JDigital: ]condcom
10:50  _ZofBot4: IE Conditional Comments: http://haslayout.net/condcom
10:50  Agamemnus: or the opposite, really
10:50  Agamemnus: ideally something it will never understand
10:50  Agamemnus: oh
10:51  Agamemnus: i remember.
10:51  Agamemnus: can IE still not read styles with [attribute]?
10:52  Agamemnus: success!
10:52  Agamemnus: I made it just not light up, if it is ie
10:54  JDigital: conditional comments are the most IE specific
10:59  Agamemnus: nite
10:59  dumont: "wrap the columns in a container div and assign it a background image that repeats vertically. When tiled down the page, it creates an image of columns, and the divs can simply be laid over the top."
11:05  dumont: fk
11:05  dumont: stupid css
11:06  dumont: i have a <div id=main> <div id=nav><div id=1></div><div id=expand></div><div id=2></div></div> <div id=content></div> </div>
11:07  dumont: problem is that #expand is surrounded on top and on the bottom by fixed sized divs
11:07  dumont: thus I cannot tile it vertically to the end of page or whateer
11:07  dumont: because it messes up #2
11:08  dumont: when the tiling is applied to #main and starts 450px down the page where #1 ends
11:14  joffo: Hey all CSS pros! Can anyone help me out with a little problem? I'm supposed to maintain this site: http://www.europrofil.se/index.php?page=produkter-2 and i would like to change color to just one of the orange squares to the left. Is that possible?
11:18  MauriceJ: joffo: Yes, use Firebug (Firefox & other browsers) or Dragonfly (Opera) to find out what that element is in the CSS and then you can write a class or ID for it with a different background color specified.
11:18  dumont: how hard can it be to fking just make 2 divs side by side to each other equal in height
11:19  dumont: all these examples are worthless because they pretend to do it by painting the background, which is a PoS because I actually need the div to fill in the space
11:20  dumont: how do I know? I click on the shortest div in firebug and it shows me how long the div is
11:20  dumont: and its not the same height as the other div
11:36  dumont: everyone is such a pro they can't help with a simple equal columns problem
11:38  joffo: MauriceJ: Are experienced with cmsms? Cause i'm totaly lost, i haven't got a clue were i would actually put ID. I do know were in the CSS i would put the ID but not were to put it in the HTML. Get what i'm trying to say? I'm such a noob :/
11:39  MauriceJ: dumont: You're upset and speaking in a rather aggrovating way and I think it has put people off in here.  If you want help then I'd suggest you change your tone and realise people are donating their time and energy to help others in here and won't help somebody being pissy or rude.
11:39  MauriceJ: joffo: Hold on a second I'm a bit swamped.
11:39  joffo: MauriceJ: It's cool, thanks for trying to help!!
11:40  dumont: i've been asking for a whole day now, both pleading and polite
11:40  dumont: instead people throw links at me which are either not what I want, don't work, or I don't understand them, and when I need help on it, silence...
11:41  MauriceJ: dumont: Nobody is trying to help you anymore, the silence bespeaks volumes.  Interpret that as and how you will.

11:43  dumont: se.. throwing the same stuff that is using background fill that isn't suitable to my situation
11:43  MauriceJ: joffo: I actually despise CMS's for the very reason that they are forests of fail and difficult to adjust.  I honestly don't know if I can help you or not.

11:44  MauriceJ: dumont: You can continue to be aggro and upset in here but it won't get you any closer to what you want other than you reading the articles, trying the code, and searching the net based on those article.
11:44  MauriceJ: s/article/articles/
11:44  dumont: here try and makee red section expand till the whole nav section is the same hieght as contents
11:45  dumont: i've been trying a whole day now... and all these links didn't help
11:45  MauriceJ: dumont: Are you demanding somethng of me?
11:45  eighty4: dumont: have you read and understood them?
11:45  dumont: MauriceJ been there done that, it just doesn't work in my case...
11:47  dumont: eighty4 I understood as much as I can, as far as I think I see the problem is that these same column height examples are faking it by just painting the background carelessly, where as in my case I have #nav_bottom which has to be a kind of footer for #nav div, so painint till the end of the page doesn't work for me
11:49  dumont: MauriceJ i won't even dignify that with a response
11:49  gma: can anybody remind the name of the IE bug that puts a little underline character next to an image that's inside an <a> tag?
11:58  charlietm: hey, i need a bit of help adding a box around the latest news widget on this page http://charlesmurphy.co.uk/wordpress/ if anyone could spare some a few minute? :)
11:58  eighty4: dumont: yepp, from what I can see of what you're trying to do a "plain" faux columns wouldn't really work. But it
11:58  eighty4: dumont: But it depends on what you want in your red column
11:59  dumont: red column will have an image that can be expanded vertically
11:59  eighty4: dumont: if that just should be empty you could do a faux column and then just position: absolute the top/bottom left columns
11:59  dumont: background-image: url('images/cm_06.png'); with a repeat-y is what I want the red section to be
12:00  dumont: it'd work fine if the vertical div expanded all the way just like a horizontal div does
12:00  dumont: unfortunately vertical div only expands as much as it needs to and hence the problem
12:01  dumont: eighty4 and thank you for looking, and noticing how faux column examples don't really work
12:02  Memori: gma: the only bug that I can think of with similar behavior is the ghost/duplicate text bug, you might want to search for it
12:05  eighty4: dumont: exactly, not really sure how to do that. I'd need to think about it and I don't have time for that right now
12:06  MauriceJ: charlietm: Are you using Firebug/Dragonfly with your browser?
12:06  charlietm: yeah, firebug
12:07  charlietm: i have inspected the element but am abit rubbish at this
12:07  charlietm: :/
12:07  MauriceJ: charlietm: Okay, so you've not found the element that needs the border attribute added?
12:08  charlietm: yeah
12:08  charlietm: "widget"
12:08  charlietm: thats the div class
12:08  dumont: charlietm link to your site again
12:09  MauriceJ: charlietm: inside the .widget add border:1px solid black;
12:11  charlietm: cool, will add now :
12:11  charlietm: :)
12:14  charlietm: http://pastebin.com/6pWkkXcc that what it looks like
12:14  charlietm: doesnt seem to work though :/
12:16  dumont: works here...
12:16  dumont: make sure you uploaded the right css to the right place
12:16  dumont: and that changes are saved
12:17  charlietm: yeah defo in the correct place as im just changing it on wordpress
12:17  dumont: i don't see the site's css having been added with border:1px solid black;
12:17  charlietm: hm maybe im adding it to the wrong place for that widget
12:17  charlietm: ?
12:17  MauriceJ: charlietm: Hold on, mate.
12:17  atmos4: argh, col and colgrp could be incredibly useful, if it wasn't incredibly limited ...
12:18  dumont: no... its the right place
12:18  dumont: what you can do is go to your website, find that div with the latest news item
12:18  dumont: click on it
12:18  dumont: on the right you'll see it's css properties
12:18  MauriceJ: charlietm: I don't see the border attribute in your CSS mate.
12:18  dumont: right click, add new element/property
12:18  dumont: type in border
12:18  dumont: hit enter
12:19  dumont: type in 1px solid black hit enter
12:19  MauriceJ: charlietm: When I put the border attribute into the CSS it works fine.
12:19  dumont: and you'll see a border around your latest news
12:20  MauriceJ: charlietm: The correct file to deal with is 'style.css'
12:20  charlietm: where to a right click.
12:20  charlietm: sorry not to used to firebug
12:24  dumont: where the css properties for that div are
12:24  dumont: you first need to select the div on the left
12:26  charlietm: ah, cool did it
12:26  charlietm: :D
12:26  charlietm: thats a start, i just wanted it around the latest widget though :/
12:29  dumont: huh?
12:29  dumont: define latest widget
12:36  charlietm: sorry
12:36  charlietm: just the top part of the bar of widgets
12:36  charlietm: the ones with the news items in
12:36  charlietm: so not the google maps or facebook one
12:44  dumont: you mean only Latest news?

13:50  dumont: speak eat a sock, I helped with what I knew, and what worked, and I forgot about unique id because that's not what I was concerned with fixing

13:58  MauriceJ: Tholas: Indeed.
13:58  MauriceJ: Lazylegs: Yeah I'm trying to find any now through the haze.
13:58  MauriceJ: Nope, aside from iaj it's been quiet.  I wonder why?
14:08  iaj: Hmm when I got 2 divs next to each other, and both of them got the float:left attribute and no width specified, how can I make margin-left on the second div work?
14:10  nikki`: iaj: does the second div has a different class or ID?
14:10  iaj: nikki`: yeah.
14:10  nikki`: well give it margin-left:10px; ?
14:10  iaj: I did but its not resulting in anything. :(
14:11  nikki`: can you paste the url
14:11  iaj: mhh only got it... locally
14:11  iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/322187
14:12  Lazylegs: iaj, give overflow: hidden to another one you want to move (this will results that you cannot put stuff outside the div as a side product unfortunately)
14:12  iaj: Lazylegs: is that the common way?
14:12  iaj: so I'd give overflow:hidden to the secondentry?
14:12  Lazylegs: It works, and could be said common. Not used if need to overflow stuff outside the div
14:13  knobo: is it possible to get a dt and dd to be on same line (no newline after dt)?
14:13  iaj: Lazylegs: hmmm putting overflow:hidden on the second one has no effect :(
14:13  Lazylegs: knobo, yes.. float: left the dt
14:14  knobo: hmm.. so easy :)
14:14  knobo: Lazylegs: thanx
14:14  MauriceJ: iaj: Can you put your code into webdev instead for a test case, please?
14:14  Lazylegs: iaj: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01o
14:15  Lazylegs: I moved the entries only
14:15  LCID_Fire: What are the criteria to which to format via display:table-row and display:table-cell? It generates a pretty weird "table" for me - although I only have 2 X 2 cells
14:15  MauriceJ: Lazylegs: Nice one.
14:15  Lazylegs: dunno wwhat is supposed to be side by side
14:15  knobo: but is there any way to align the dd elements without using a table instead?
14:15  MauriceJ: knobo: URL or test case in webdev?
14:16  knobo: MauriceJ: just a minute..
14:17  Lazylegs: knobo: ne.
14:17  Lazylegs: 15:15 < Lazylegs> dunno wwhat is supposed to be side by side
14:17  Lazylegs: whops

14:18  wathek_: does this work with IE8 ? #topmenu > #menuCK > ul > li ?
14:18  Lazylegs: wathek_, should work
14:18  iaj: Lazylegs: can you tell me why that secondentry first starts moving when I give it margin-left 218px ? theres no way to have it started at 0?
14:19  iaj: that's what I actually tried
14:19 --- curt`off is now known as Curt`
14:20  Lazylegs: iaj, when you have floated element on left as an example, that has width of 200px as example.. the other element on side of it in a way goes behind it.. you might have seen this link, nice image about behaviour: http://colinaarts.com/articles/the-magic-of-overflow-hidden/
14:21  iaj: ohhh ok, got it... so theres no way to have margin-left with, well like a offset
14:22  knobo: I don't know if I use the dl in right way, but I thought it might sute: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01s
14:23  knobo: MauriceJ: did you see it?
14:23  knobo: Then I want the dd's to be aligned under each other.
14:23  Lazylegs: iaj, you could use position: relative and left: value then
14:24  MauriceJ: knobo: Looking now, mate.
14:24  Lazylegs: iaj: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01t <-- you can see the difference here.. first has relative and another the same margin value
14:25  Lazylegs: knobo, you have to give some width to dt.. as now it changes with the content so dd's will not align
14:25  iaj: Lazylegs: thanks! another way would be to assign widths to the divs?  but I think I need another attribute then as well for the div's to actually take their space in firebug
14:26  Lazylegs: iaj, if you don't need the width, don't assign them :) I use overflow: hidden if needed for the trick to get the margins.. on those elements where I know I don't need to overflow stuff
14:26  iaj: so you have to calculate the correct margin..? :)
14:26  MauriceJ: knobo: Like this? http://www.webdevout.net/test?01u
14:26  knobo: Lazylegs: looks like that works yes
14:27  knobo: MauriceJ: Yes that look good.
14:28  knobo: Thank you guys.
14:28  Lazylegs: iaj, no.. when used overflow: hidden.. it will clear the floated like in the article is shown
14:28  MauriceJ: knobo: We are here to help.  You're welcome.
14:30  iaj: Lazylegs: yey I know, but if you got just the information about what the space should be to the previous element, you'd need to calcualte previous elt width+space
14:30  Lazylegs: iaj, yes
14:40  rgr: how do I absolute position a UL top:128 but still have it centred?
14:42  Lazylegs: rgr, horizontal or vertical.. and have a fixed size?
14:43  Lazylegs: blaah, obviously horizontal if top is 128 :)
14:43  rgr: centered horiz : no fixed size

14:44  dumont: so.. nooone here can help me with equal column lengths (faux columns do not suite my style of page layout), so I guess I'll use javascript...
14:45  Lazylegs: dumont, there's only few viable solutions for equal heights.. if you cannot use them, then you have to use JS
14:45  Lazylegs: rgr, no fixed width or any width?
14:46  dumont: do you have examples of these few viable solutions? I just want to make sure I haven't overlooked any, I've visited probably 2 dozen sites with a ton of different and similar ways
14:47  legostud: dumont: the only way I've been able to do columns with equal height is to use a table.
14:47  legostud: I didn't like it either
14:47  Lazylegs: dumont, you tried the huge bottom padding value and same negative bottom margin
14:47  legostud: but it worked
14:47  Lazylegs: or display: table-cell
14:48  dumont: display: table-cell is only css3 right? can you tell me what disadvantages it brings? i have not tried it
14:48  dumont: i did not try tables, because i was hoping to do css
14:49  dumont: I have not tried the padding and margin, though I do not think it wil work
14:49  dumont: here's my simplified example http://www.webdevout.net/test?01v
14:49  Lazylegs: dumont, it is css2.1 but ie has problems.. ie7 and 6 exactly
14:50  dumont: the goal is to get the red section to expand vertically until the bottom of the blue section touches the and is on the same height as the bottom of the #contents/ number
14:50  dumont: number 30
14:52  Lazylegs: why you cant use faux columns?
14:53  Lazylegs: aah, I know... sorry :)
14:53  dumont: take a look, because the blue section gets fked
14:54  dumont: then again... if you can get the red section to expand so that the blue section's bottom touches the bottom of #contents, I'll take it :)
14:57  iaj: Lazylegs: thanks a lot... that overflow is working nicely!
15:05  Lazylegs: dumont, I got the blue to stick to bottom always ;)
15:06  dumont: i hope it also works in my full example, because that's not the whole page, I also have a header and footer above and below #main
15:06  dumont: give me a link plz
15:06  Lazylegs: I dun have the red to fill the area yet
15:06  dumont: oh
15:07  Lazylegs: blaah, I need to reset me brainz
15:10  dumont: can you share with what you have so far? i'll see if I can work on it too
15:11  dumont: Lazylegs *
15:15  Lazylegs: dumont, nah.. there was a kind of mistake.. is the sidebar always fixed width?
15:16  dumont: yes
15:16  dumont: everything is fixed except the height of the red section and the height and width of #contents
15:18  dumont: i'm looking at what you did test?01w
15:19  Lazylegs: I haven't saved any :)
15:20  dumont: overflow:hidden isn't yours? :)
15:21  dumont: hehe, well, it cuts off contents section anyway
15:22  Lazylegs: dumont, getting really close.. did own just make it clearer.. hate when cannot indent with tab in the editor
15:23  Lazylegs: dumont, will the red section have any content?
15:25  dumont: no
15:25  dumont: it will just use a background image and expand it vertically
15:25  farhad2010:  hi please help me http://pastebin.com/z0DxazB5
15:25  farhad2010: test it in ie 8 & 6 & 7
15:25  Lazylegs: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01x&raw
15:25  Lazylegs: dumont ^
15:25  farhad2010:  it worked great only in ie8 and firefox :(
15:26  Lazylegs: Hmmm.. I leave from work.. hopefully you can come up with something from that dumont.. kind of hmmm solution. but works
15:26  Lazylegs: maybe
15:26  dumont: Lazylegs I don't want to be too excited.. but this looks exactly how I want it
15:26  dumont: Lazylegs in case I don't see you later, thank you very much
15:27  Lazylegs: dumont, it does not work in full sense :/
15:27  dumont: i'll go look at the code now
15:27  Lazylegs: has bugs
15:27  dumont: define full sense?
15:27  dumont: what bugs
15:27  Lazylegs: works when there's plenty of contents.. like the 30 lines
15:27  Lazylegs: if less.. not so well :/
15:30  Lazylegs: dumont, bit fixed version.. still needs refining.. but am off now.. need to spend time at home sometimes
15:30  Lazylegs: dumont: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01y
15:31  dumont: thanks, but i kind of need at least 10 pixels of the red section
15:31  dumont: otherwise it throws off the graphics design
15:31  dumont: i'll see if I can redo the graphics to make it so that it can be 0
15:31  farhad2010: help me  http://pastebin.com/z0DxazB5   why this work good only in ie8 and ff :(
15:33  Lazylegs: dumont: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01z
15:33  Lazylegs: (adjusted the min-height)
15:33  Lazylegs: :P
15:34  dumont: what did you change between x and y? :S still can't find it
15:34  Lazylegs: dumont, slight alterations, cant remember anymore
15:35  dumont: found it min-height to contents
15:35  Lazylegs: dumont, but basicly.. if the green area would be height 400px, the red (#nav) min-height: to 440px so with the #content
15:35  dumont: weird, i would have htought that min-heihgt would be needed for nav_first instead
15:35  Lazylegs: dumont, so it will show bit of the red
15:35  dumont: ok
15:35  dumont: thank you
15:35  Lazylegs: dumont, there will be issues with that solution :) I promise it.. but works with the content height

15:44  skrypets: how to fix shifting text in select box while zooming in IE ???
15:47  dumont: Lazylegs I don't know what you are smoking saying "there will be issue" but I'm crossing my fingers at you, because so far at least on firefox 3.6 it is working like a charm, can I kiss you? :P haven't tried other browsers, cuz I have no other browsers, just finished porting it over to my site
15:50  skrypets: how to fix shifting text in select box while zooming in IE ?
15:51  CoJaBo: example page?
15:54  MauriceJ: I keep my VIM cheatsheet on my keyboard ;)
15:54  MauriceJ: Aaaand wrong channel. Sorry.
15:55  skrypets: i think any drop down manu has same issue
15:55  skrypets: cant provide that url , it's protected
15:55  skrypets: menu*
15:56  MauriceJ: skrypets: Read the topic of this channel.
15:56  MauriceJ: skrypets: There are instructions there for you to follow before you ask questions.
15:57  charlietm: how do i put a shadow between the page wrap and background eg. http://109.228.5.193/development/janus/store/index.php
15:57  smop: MauriceJ: how long did it take you to get used to using vim?
15:57  dumont: hmm now i see the problem :(
15:57  dumont: the footer rides up
15:57  dumont: when there is not enough content
15:58  MauriceJ: smop: I honestly don't remember, mate.  It wasn't a 5 minute thing, that's for sure.  The basics took a few days such as moving about and insert and delete/paste but it's so feature rich I reckon I'll be learning it for quite some years to come.
15:58  MauriceJ: smop: I still don't know how to use recording mode, even.
15:58  skrypets: for example http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option
15:58  MauriceJ: skrypets: http://w3fools.com  Read that.
15:59  skrypets: when you zooming text in drop down shifting to the bottom, in my case only text is hidding to the bottom
16:00  dumont: ooo solved it by adding min-height to container div :P
16:00  dumont: i think Lazylegs solved it for me but i didn't carry over the code, and just thought of it
16:01  CoJaBo: w3 fools? LOL
16:01  HappyPelican1: heh, yeah I just saw it to CoJaBo
16:01  HappyPelican1: I'd seen something simlar a while ago ... looks good :)
16:01 * CoJaBo never sex it before lol
16:01  CoJaBo: saw it
16:02  smop: MauriceJ: oic, the problem for me is i dont use qwerty that often, which would make the learning curve a bit higher, but i plan on learning it
16:02  MauriceJ: smop: You using Dvorak?
16:02  skrypets: some ideas how to fix shifting text in drop down while zooming in IE ?
16:03  CoJaBo: skrypets:  post example page
16:03  skrypets: every drop down
16:03  skrypets:  http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_option
16:03  MauriceJ: CoJaBo & HappyPelican2 Yeah really good site that.
16:03  CoJaBo: skrypets:  then its an ie bug
16:04  skrypets: yes it is , but i think there is chance to fix it
16:04  smop: MauriceJ: even worse, colemak
16:04  smop: though there is a vim layout for that too and i have it printed off
16:05  CoJaBo: skrypets: you can emulate dropdowns using js
16:06  MauriceJ: smop: Woah, what made you move to that layout?  I've been on qwerty since 1981.  I'd go nuts having to learn a new layout like that.
16:06  MauriceJ: smop: I'm actually looking for a Finnish VIM layout because it's a pain hitting 'Esc' because I can't hit ctrl+[
16:06  smop: MauriceJ: i was bored and had some free time
16:07  smop: colemak is really similar to qwerty so its pretty easy to learn
16:07  MauriceJ: smop: You were really really really really bored. :D
16:07  MauriceJ: smop: Ah, I must have that mixed up with Dvorak varient then or something else.
16:08  smop: yeah, probably

16:17  ZombieLoffe: Announcement, depends entirely on situation. Style whatever is necessary to achieve the desired effect.
16:18  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Inputs and labels are inline by default... don't float anything and it will be on one line

16:25  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Sounds a lot like you're floating them :P
16:26  MauriceJ: ZombieLoffe: Why I haven't used menus since 2006, where you been??
16:26  ZombieLoffe: indubitably
16:27  farhad2010: no one help me?
16:27  MauriceJ: That's a dubious place.
16:27  Goleif: farhad2010: No. No one help you.

16:27  Dartfall: List menus are bad for navigation bars?
16:27  Jackass4D: farhad2010, just listen to what i said
16:27  MauriceJ: Dartfall: They are bad for accessability that's for sure.
16:28  farhad2010: ok be patient
16:28  farhad2010: No war!
16:28  ZombieLoffe: Jackass4D, you said it after he was booted -.-

16:28  ZombieLoffe: They're not, he's trollin'
16:28  Goleif: He oughta get slapped

16:28  MauriceJ: I thought they were as there was a lot of clutter.  My bad.

16:29  MauriceJ: I might be a tad wrong but I sure ain't trolling.
16:29  MauriceJ: Oh I was thinking of drop-down.
16:29  ZombieLoffe: Then you're just mistaken...
16:29  MauriceJ: Sheesh gimme a break!
16:29  MauriceJ: Drop-downs are not good for accessibility and I'm sticking to that!
16:29  speak: :D
16:29 * MauriceJ hides.
16:29  ZombieLoffe: I would agree with that.
16:30  Goleif: iaj: Can't you just use display:block;float:left; on both inputs and labels, and make the problem disappear?
16:30  MauriceJ: Dartfall: List menus rock, please pardon me.
16:30  MauriceJ: Dartfall: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
16:31  nikki`: lol
16:31  Goleif: MauriceJ: There's no problems with dropdowns if you make an alternative solution also.
16:31  iaj: Goleif: hmm that doesn't fix it.. I already tried that
16:31  MauriceJ: Goleif: Yes but do most people do that?  No, and how do I know?  I have a blind friend who is on the net who complains all the time about things.
16:32  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Uh, I don't see the problem. If you remove the <br>, it will all be on one line, with the checkbox to the left and the text to the right.
16:32  MauriceJ: I forget the name of the app she uses to manoeuvre sites but it's hell for her.
16:32  Goleif: Maurice: Still doesn't change my point. Cars are neat too, but not if people use them like idiots.
16:32  iaj: ZombieLoffe: huh.. what <br>?
16:32  ZombieLoffe: iaj: The one after Ja? :P
16:33  MauriceJ: Goleif: It's a subject you can go on about.
16:33  ZombieLoffe: iaj: Oh, I was looking at the old paste
16:33  Goleif: MauriceJ: Let's.
16:33  Goleif: xD
16:33  MauriceJ: Goleif: No thanks, have a cookie. =)
16:33  ZombieLoffe: iaj: You're floating the checkboxes.
16:33  Goleif: MauriceJ: Ooh, cookies
16:33  MauriceJ: Chocolate chip!
16:34  dumont: I have a <span> with text inside a <div>, I am adding margin to span, so that the span/text would move down from the top of the div, but it's not working, however left right and bottom margins show up in firebug, how come margin-top isn't working? i'm using margin:40px 0 0 40px;
16:34  ZombieLoffe: iaj: If you remove float: left; from the inputs, it's all on one line. Use firebug if you don't know where the floating is declared.
16:34  dumont: <div><span>TEXT</span></div>
16:35  Goleif: iaj: Otherwise, try !important to override already set rules.
16:35  dumont: hmm i wonder why i had to float it
16:35  ZombieLoffe: Yuck. Don't use !important, unless absolutely necessary. Much better to work with specificity.
16:35  lucasw: dumont try to add padding to the span instead
16:35  dumont: lucasw i tried padding, didn't work either
16:36  Goleif: ZombieLoffe: I agree, but it's good enough when trying to find problems.
16:36  dumont: margin and padding start to work when I float it
16:36  ZombieLoffe: Not as a permanent solution.
16:36  ZombieLoffe: dumont: vertical margins are collapsed on inline elements
16:36  lucasw: dumont try to specific the span more in your css like .main .content div span maybe that will fix it
16:37  lucasw: .main .content div span {margin-top: 20px;}
16:37  dumont: i'm doing it based on unique id
16:37  dumont: #title
16:37  Announcement: what makes it when you hover over something the inactive items shift down
16:37  Announcement: why
16:37  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Did you read what I just said? -.-
16:38  dumont: ZombieLoffe yes, and it makes sense
16:38  dumont: though since i'm not very familiar with css i didn't know that
16:38  Announcement: i think you need to be explained the point system too
16:39  iaj: ZombieLoffe: thanks so much... :))  its working now :)
16:39  ZombieLoffe: dumont, padding on the div would be a simple solution
16:39  iaj: just how can I avoid the space the checkbox takes... beforehand .. the padding
16:39  ZombieLoffe: Announcement, because you're applying some styling on :hover that makes the hovered list item larger, presumably
16:39  dumont: i thought of it but decided just not to do it in case I do something later and don't want padding from the div
16:39  ZombieLoffe: iaj: remove the whitespace in the html
16:39  dumont: and thank you
16:39  Announcement: how can i stop that
16:40  ZombieLoffe: Announcement, don't make it larger?
16:40  ZombieLoffe: depends on how you style it, really.
16:40  ZombieLoffe: eg. what makes it larger
16:42  Announcement: i have something like this: <ul class="terminal"><li>Item 1</li><li><a href="#">Item 2+a</a><ul><li>Item 2.1</li><li>Item 2.2</li></ul></ul>
16:42  dumont: does css have a property for fonts that causes the font's rendering to be like so -> in photoshop you can select crisp/sharp/etc, basically I think what's called Anti-Aliasing option for a font/text
16:42  Announcement: i want it to be a straight row, then te drop down should be like x2 width and straight down
16:43  ZombieLoffe: Drop-down navigation... yuck
16:43  ZombieLoffe: dumont: no
16:43  ZombieLoffe: dumont: anti-aliasing is handled by the user's system
16:43  dumont: OOOoo, so I'm stuck with this rough edged font?
16:44  ZombieLoffe: Or you can switch font.
16:44  Announcement: you can still change the font though..
16:44  dumont: can't switch font, it's theme specific and the font is part of the theme, thus it's very important that this exact font is used
16:46  ZombieLoffe: If it's any consolation fonts are auto anti-aliased on all newer systems
16:46  Announcement: brb
16:48  dumont: ughmm i'm not working on a dinosaur ocmputer...
16:48  dumont: winxp sp1-2, firefox3.6.x latest
16:49  dumont: don't think it's antialiased, it looks like crap especially at this resolution
16:49  dumont: i might switch font for general text, and keep this font for bigger main text
16:50  dumont: cuz this font is terrible+100 at low sizes
16:50  dumont: or wait
16:50  dumont: maybe it's cuz i'm using pixel based size instead of point based
16:51  dumont: i think i noticed that pixel based size causes non-anti-aliased versions of the font
16:52  ZombieLoffe: that has nothing to do with it, dumont
16:52  dumont: actually yes it does
16:52  ZombieLoffe: dumont, turn on cleartype? :P
16:52  dumont: I also noticed this same effect with a Qt Creator
16:52  dumont: where I used this font
16:53  dumont: and a font similar to it
16:53  ZombieLoffe: that said, you shouldn't ever use px or pt based font-sizing. Stick to relative font-sizes all the way.
16:53  dumont: when using pixel based font size, it was not clear, it had abbrasions and all kinds of weird bloats etc
16:53  ZombieLoffe: that has nothing to do with it. :P
16:54  dumont: the layout calls for pixel perfect, so I need the font sizes to be in keep with the proportion to the graphics next to it
16:54  ZombieLoffe: Ugh... no you don't
16:55  iaj: ZombieLoffe: So, now I adjusted my form page... anyway can you tell me how I can get rid of the space before the radio button, and create a space after the checkbox button that's coming underneath?        http://fuel-management.de/jay/registrierungsseite_verimatic.html
16:55  dumont: unless i'm mistaken about what relative font sizing means
16:55  ZombieLoffe: It means you let the user set the default font-size, and all font-sizes are relative to the default.
16:55  ZombieLoffe: meaning users who want larger font-sizes because of disabilities or whatever, will get it.
16:55  Announcement: html-spacing..
16:55  dumont: yes, this principle cannot work here
16:56  ZombieLoffe: Yes it can, and it should.
16:56  dumont: because the text has to be proprtional to the graphics
16:56  ZombieLoffe: You can't make sure it is, anyway.
16:56  dumont: the user can ctrl++ the page and the whole page would zoom in
16:56  ZombieLoffe: In some browsers
16:57  ZombieLoffe: Just set a relative unit matching your size now with default settings -- that way, people who have not changed font settings will get pixel-perfect and people who have will get larger fonts
16:57  Announcement: iaj: you should probably learn html first, your using it all wrong.
16:57  Announcement: here: http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/
16:57  dumont: wait a sec, doesn't firefox has a selection of font size somewhere in the menu?
16:58  ZombieLoffe: iaj, play with the width property of the inputs to change spacing
16:59  ZombieLoffe: dumont, uh.. yes. Almost all browsers do.
16:59  dumont: ZombieLoffe in the case with people getting larger fonts, my theme would not work in this case because the font would overrun graphics, and etc, and it would break the layout/theme
16:59  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Sounds like a bad layout
17:00  dumont: ZombieLoffe I know you are gonna say bad design choice, and my response is, it's meant to be that way in order to similate the spirit of the theme
17:00  ZombieLoffe: The spirit of the theme is bad usability?
17:00  dumont: don't knock it if you don't know what it is
17:00  ZombieLoffe: I know what it sounds like.
17:01  dumont: and it was #1 never designed for the web #2 its a unique theme type not found in any modern computers #3 its futuristic theme that defys current computer interface based models
17:02  dumont: defies*
17:02  ZombieLoffe: http://css-discuss.incutio.com/wiki/Using_Points
17:02  ZombieLoffe: if it wasn't designed for the web it shouldn't be on the web :p
17:02  dumont: basically its a static based interface model, thus its not like any of the dynamic computer interfaces we use today where we can resize windows and the buttons move to be nice
17:03  iaj: ZombieLoffe: ah tahnks, ive been doing so already.. hmmm.. another thing when theres a 2 line text next to the checkbox.. how can I first have the checkbox vertically aligned centered and both of the textparts indented? :_D  sorry for bugging...
17:04  dumont: ZombieLoffe can I knock your teeth out? :P just because it wasn't designed for the web doesn't mean its not supposed to be adapted for the net, don't be a hard ass :)
17:04  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Indeed... "adapting for the web" has more implications than "copy paste graphics and text" :P
17:04  dumont: agreed
17:04  ZombieLoffe: The web is a very different medium from print.
17:05  dumont: however, what you consider adaptation, is not how far I'm willing to go because by your standards, it's impossible to maintain the look and feel of the interface
17:05  ZombieLoffe: Whatever.
17:05  dumont: ZombieLoffe I agree
17:06  ZombieLoffe: iaj: in that situation, easiest would probably be to add some padding or margin-top to a container containing the text and inputs. Alternatively, you could use a fixed height together with a line-height to center vertically.
17:07  dumont: my first and foremost goal is to keep the look and feel, everything after it is secondary
17:07  dumont: it's the nature of this type of website...
17:07  ZombieLoffe: Wow, accessability and usability are secondary? Poor choice of priorities for web design, I'd say...
17:08  Bartzy|work: Hi
17:08  Bartzy|work: http://geothermal.co.il/
17:08  dumont: if it doesn't maintain this type of look and feel, people will consider it a poor web design
17:08  dumont: of this particular theme
17:08  Bartzy|work: When you zoom in (to see the text bigger), the lines in the header of the page gets all messed up.. any idea why ?
17:09  ZombieLoffe: "maintaining look and feel" does not imply pixel perfect font sizes
17:09  dumont: so... since point based size works, and ctrl++ causes the images and the font to enlarge, I consider it to be a good enough alternative
17:09  dumont: ZombieLoffe in this case it does.. because that is the essense of this type of theme
17:09  ZombieLoffe: dumont, if you'd read my link you'd know point sizes are entirely unreliable for font-sizing. 12pt may look different on different versions of windows or osx or other oses.
17:10  dumont: link? where :O
17:10  Bartzy|work: How can I make texts stay at the same size when the user magnifies the page ?
17:10  dumont: and yes, I was gonna test it later
17:10  Bartzy|work: with ctrl+middle mouse ?
17:10  nikki`: Bartzy|work : font-size:12px; ?
17:11  Bartzy|work: nikki`: font-size: 16px; doesn't work, font is still getting bigger when magnifying...
17:11  nikki`: try it in em`s
17:11  dumont: 20pt works for me
17:11  dumont: Bartzy|work
17:12  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work: Oh my god, you should absolutely not do that
17:12  nikki`: no matter what they are set as, if you magnify into the browser, there going to also magnify
17:12  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work, in general removing control of the browser from the user is a realy bad idea
17:12  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work, think about your users with poor eyesight...
17:12  Bartzy|work: ZombieLoffe: OK, understandable... Can you please look at www.geothermal.co.il and see that when you magnify the header lines are weird ?
17:13  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work, your issue comes from the fixed width on #title -- if I were you, I wouldn't care about it.
17:13  Dartfall: Guys, http://www.lol.com/ is down. What are we going to do now, lol? :D
17:13  Bartzy|work: ZombieLoffe: Why not care about it ?
17:13  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work: Because a very minor portion of your users will zoom in, and the ones that to will not mind a broken border.
17:14  dumont: the only comments in css files are /**/ ?
17:14  ZombieLoffe: Don't worry Dartfall, http://zombo.com/ is still up
17:14  ZombieLoffe: yes, dumont
17:14  Bartzy|work: ZombieLoffe: As it happens, the owner of the site zooms in.. :)
17:14  dumont: nothing else works?
17:14  dumont: # // :S
17:14  ZombieLoffe: just /* */
17:15  dumont: bummer
17:16  dumont: what's the max precision for em sizes?
17:16  dumont: 2?
17:16  dumont: 1.75em?
17:16  Bartzy|work: ZombieLoffe: Any idea how to fix it ? :|
17:16  ZombieLoffe: Bartzy|work, set a bigger width on #title (400px or something) and adjust the margin-right accordingly
17:17  dumont: ZombieLoffe in firefox how would you increase font size?
17:17  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Not sure about the exact decimal, but more than 3, anywho
17:17  ZombieLoffe: dumont, if I wanted to increase default font-size, I'd do it in the option. If I wanted to zoom a specific page, I'd ctrl+scrollwheel.
17:18  dumont: i don't think 1.78 and 1.8 have a difference, so it just might be 1 decimal place...
17:18  ZombieLoffe: in the options, even.
17:18  ZombieLoffe: No, dumont, that's because of pixel rounding.
17:18  dumont: sorry, where is this option for chaning font size?
17:18  iaj: ZombieLoffe: I set a surrounding container around the checkboxes stuff, tried to get it with line-height, and vertical align: middle, but no success..
17:18  ZombieLoffe: Tools -> options -> content (might not be the exact wording, I have a non-english firefox)
17:19  dumont: nvm found it
17:19  ZombieLoffe: iaj, that's not what vertical-align does.

17:30  ZombieLoffe: probably not.
17:31  dravekx: MauriceJ, get this... the page looks fine, presentation went great, guy emails me this morning and says he tweaked it and it messed up a little. When I look, it has iframes, broken tables, and <style> tags all over the place, even before the doctype. He said he read somewhere it was easier to change that way.

17:38  dumont: dravekx what an idiot XD why is he tasked with maintaining the site then XD
17:38  ZombieLoffe: dumont, all proper major browsers (that is, not IE < 9)

17:40  dumont: you guys have this round border thing bookmarked here or i gotta google it?
17:40  ZombieLoffe: just google it.
17:40  dumont: ZombieLoffe btw, I remember it was only available in mozilla webkit... are you saying that was ages ago and its available for safari ie9 firefox opera and etc now?
17:41  etcetera_: how do you organize your css relative to your views?
17:41  dumont: supported*
17:41  etcetera_: just one large css file?
17:41  MauriceJ: etcetera_: Define 'large'.
17:41 --- monsterkiller is now known as MonsterKiller
17:41  preaction: etcetera_: i have one large CSS file seperated into blocks of "Layout" and "Fonts & Colors"
17:41  etcetera_: ok.
17:43  ZombieLoffe: dumont, safari runs on webkit, and yes opera and ie9 support it (iirc)
17:43  ZombieLoffe: Actually, I might be wrong about that.
17:43  ZombieLoffe: A quick google should let you know, though.
17:44  dumont: Mozilla’s Firefox browser has supported the border-radius property, with the -moz- prefix, since version 1.0. However, it is only since version 3.5 that the browser has allowed elliptical corners, i.e. accepting two values per corner to determine the horizontal and verical radii independently.
17:44  dumont: Prior to version 3.5, the browser only accepted one value per corner, resulting in corners with equal horizontal and vertical radii.
17:44  ZombieLoffe: Cool story bro
17:45  skrypets:  how to center text in drop down menu ?
17:45  dumont: so I wonder when firefox started supporting border-radious without -moz prefix
17:45  ZombieLoffe: skrypets: in a <select>?
17:45  skrypets: yes'
17:46  undernoee: how do I create an exception in table styling? I want a row to have cells with red bg, but one of those cells need to have a white bg
17:46  preaction: undernoee: a class or an ID probably
17:46  ZombieLoffe: skrypets, text-align: center; would be your best bet, but browsers aren't great at styling selects, so support may be sketchy.
17:46  undernoee: a class for that cell overrides the class which affects the whole row?
17:48  skrypets: ZombieLoffe thx, yeah i know but need IE 7-8 support
17:49  iaj: ZombieLoffe: hmmm, seems like I'm uncapable of getting it to work, I can put the checkbox down (even tho its individual) but the text won't get aligned on the left (like on mutliple line lis), http://fuel-management.de/jay/registrierungsseite_verimatic.html mhh..
17:49  ZombieLoffe: skrypets: AFAIK, you're pretty much screwed. There might be a way to modify or replace the select with javascript, but I don't know of any.
17:49  undernoee: I have <tr class="">, which affects all rows. Tried <td class=""> to make one of the cells of that row have a different color, but seems that tr class is overriding td class
17:50  undernoee: *all cells in that row
17:50  dravekx: skrypets, you could always try using a fixed-width font and adding some non-breaking spaces (&nbsp) to the left of your text.
17:50  kaseano: iaj you want the text under the checkboxes
17:50  ZombieLoffe: iaj, set height: 40px; line-height: 40px; on the div containing all of it, then line-height: 1em; on the label...
17:50  kaseano: ?
17:51  ZombieLoffe: iaj, on the div containing both the inputs and the label that is.
17:51  skrypets: dravekx, thx i will try
17:52  dumont: when creating a button on a webpage whats the best tag to use? also since it has to link to somewhere, how can I disable the selection of the link when you click or drag it?
17:52  dumont: a button with border-radius
17:52  ZombieLoffe: undernoee, could be a specificity thing. Try increasing the specificity of the td selector.
17:52  ZombieLoffe: ]css specificity @ undernoee
17:52  _ZofBot4: undernoee, CSS Specificity: http://htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/ , http://w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity
17:52  dumont: i don't want the dashed line or whatever to appear around the button
17:53  kaseano: dumont:  I think it's outline: none
17:53  undernoee: uhmm... if no class is set in TR, the class set for TD works... so, I have to do the other way around: class per cell, leaving row un-classed?
17:53  dumont: thanks
17:53  ZombieLoffe: dumont: If it's a hyper-link you should always use <a>. You can get rid of the dotted border using :focus { outline: 0; border: 0; }
17:53  ZombieLoffe: undernoee: Sounds very much like a specificity issue, then. Do what I said.
17:54  dumont: ooo thank you
17:54  ZombieLoffe: dumont, however, it's a good idea to have _some_ :focus styling, so people tabbing through the contents know where they are.

17:56  dumont: hehe, bot works for everyone I guess
17:56  ZombieLoffe: Aragon, the simplest way -- put the image first in the html, float: right; on it and remove float: left; from your <p>s
17:56  iaj: ZombieLoffe: its resulting in the following http://fuel-management.de/jay/registrierungsseite_verimatic.html  , seems like I got something wrong :(... can't I use a ptag and assign the style (line-height) to that one?
17:57  Aragon: ZombieLoffe, thanks, i will try it, i just couldnt think of something atm :D
17:57  ZombieLoffe: iaj, I meant the div containing the label and the inputs... and yes, you could use a <p>, but why? You already have a div there
17:59  iaj: the div containing the labels and inputs - which one shall that be?? the most upper one?  div.isofleet_reg_entry ?
17:59  ZombieLoffe: no, just the one containing the label with 2 lines
18:00  undernoee: right, now I got it working. .class1 for row and td.class2 for that cell, now both work in the same table
18:02  dumont: is padding and margin inheritable from html/body  by all subelements of the page?
18:03  skrypets: for the clarification i need to center option values in select box, here is the screen http://img839.imageshack.us/img839/9059/screenshot20110117at185.png
18:04  undernoee: not quite... td.class2 overrides .class1 if there is a different bg color, but if there is no color set at all, then .class1 wins and colors all cells
18:06  kaseano: mayb dumb q, skrypets, but does text-align:center work
18:06  iaj: ZombieLoffe: the one containing the labels as you speak is div.agbitem - is that assumption correct :D
18:06  skrypets: i mean vertical align
18:06  dumont: ughmm how do I make <a> tag be of a certain rectangular size?
18:06  skrypets: inside a combo
18:06  kaseano: i like that gradient

18:08  kaseano: ya i get how to do the grad, just never thought to do it
18:09  dumont: lol major brain fart... width height will do
18:09  dumont: rofl
18:09  kaseano: skrypets: the drop down menus are usually filled from top to bottom, that's not the case here?
18:09  kaseano: if the inputs are just 1 line, and you want those centered vertically I would just use padding
18:11  skrypets: there is a list of values

18:12  skrypets: just solution for centering values for drop down select menu
18:13  skrypets: as in input fields

18:14  halcyon1234: Hi. If I have 3 floated elements (total width < width of parent), is there a way of saying "left-align the first, center-align the second, right-aligh the third"?
18:14  halcyon1234: http://jsfiddle.net/QRx9F/1/
18:14  kaseano: well with the drop down, there shouldn't be any room for centering them because they start at the top and go to the bottom of the box
18:15  dumont: a tag causes the font inside the button to be bold and underlined, how do I get rid of boldness and the underline? using ofnt-weight:normal or 400 or any other values doesn't work

18:16  dumont: nope
18:16  dumont: i odn't have any a in my css
18:16  kaseano: halcyon1234: might get yelled @ for this but tables will give them all equal pieces of the total width
18:16  qq99: hm lol
18:16  qq99: dumont, text-decoration:none?
18:17  qq99: dumont, for the underline, maybe bold needs font-style:normal; or font-variant:normal
18:17  dumont: font-style:normal is already set
18:17  qq99: dumont, but usually font-weight works for me
18:17  kaseano: ex: table = total width, each cell will be 33%
18:17  kaseano: otherwise you just need to set the widths yourself
18:17  dravekx: holy grail.
18:18  halcyon1234: kaseano: I was thinking that, and hard-coding the widths, align, etc. I was hoping for css, if only to break the office of their table dependency =)
18:18  kaseano: haha yeah
18:18  qq99: halcyon1234, make 3 columns of 33% and float all left, then put your wrap your real content inside those columns
18:18  qq99: halcyon1234, or use css3 -moz-columns -webkit-columns
18:18  kaseano: oh yeah that's a good idea
18:18  kaseano: use %s for the width of the parent
18:19 --- emma_ is now known as em
18:19  dumont: qq99 thanks, font-decoration worked, and the boldness, its the font... itself
18:19  dumont: all other values are default as normal
18:20  halcyon1234: qq99: So the inner content will be 150px wide? I can do that.  I don't suppose there's a css equiv of jquery's nth-child(x)?  (li content:nth-child(0) { Left...} ) ?
18:20  qq99: dumont, lol, I see, a css defined web font?  try to find if it has a regular variant (you'll need to change the declaration in your head)
18:20  dumont: qq99 nah.. the font is @face-font, it's theme specific
18:21  qq99: halcyon1234, well, once you have your 3x 33% width columns set up, you can do whatever you like inside those (I'd put em as position:relative; even, so that you could even absolutely position the inner children)
18:21  dumont: it's all good thx
18:21  kaseano: halcyon1234: parent {300px}, parent child {width:33%;float:left}
18:21  qq99: halcyon1234, as for the nth child thingy, I think it MIGHT exist, lemme know if you find something about it though, I recall reading something similar to css pseudo selectors
18:21  halcyon1234: Thanks,kaseano, qq99. I'll give that a go, thanks.
18:22  halcyon1234: qq99:  will report back if I find anything. =)

18:28  kaseano: actually you wouldn't need to fix the heights I guess, just pad down the check box

18:38  kaseano: I'm surprised there isn't a simple solution for vertical-alignment, seems like there's so much demand for it
18:39  dumont: I think I'll use font-face to redefine the font itself
18:40  dumont: kaseano just like deman for divs to vertically expand until the parent container...
18:40  dumont: called equal columns height problem
18:41  kaseano: yeah that too
18:41  ZombieLoffe: kaseano, css3 makes an attempt to solve it with the flexible box layout module
18:42  kaseano: for vertical align, or the vertical expansion
18:42  ZombieLoffe: there have been ways to do equal height columns in CSS since like since like css 2.0
18:42  ZombieLoffe: vertical align
18:42  farhad2010: why pictures go down in ie6 and ie7 http://pastehtml.com/view/1cu043k.html
18:42  kaseano: I dont mind the vertical expansion, it's a little more work but you can usually come up with an elegant dynamic solution
18:42  ZombieLoffe: actual, vertical-align has been pretty simple too, what with display: table-cell; and all, it's just that browser devs suck :)
18:42  kaseano: vertical align always needs padding or absolute divs tho
18:42  kaseano: yeah
18:42  kaseano: or the infamous table cell that seems to raise hell every time you use it
18:43  ZombieLoffe: <td> == bad, display: table-cell; == good
18:43  ZombieLoffe: for layout purposes
18:43  kaseano: oh rly?
18:43  ZombieLoffe: in general, yes
18:43  kaseano: wow good to know, you're flipping my world upside down :)
18:44  ZombieLoffe: no doubt.
18:44  farhad2010: why pictures go down in ie6 and ie7 http://pastehtml.com/view/1cu043k.html
18:44  kaseano: I've been using them a lot anyway regardless, especially for jquery animations that expand, they only expand naturally in horiz/vert aligned table cells
18:45  dumont: wtf, font-stretch doesn't work...
18:46  farhad2010: i should be patient?
18:46  kaseano: farhad2010: what'd you mean pictures go down
18:47  farhad2010: just test the page in ie7 or 6
18:47  kaseano: on osx :(
18:48  farhad2010: in ie 6~7 pic 2 will be in place of pic 1
18:49  kaseano: weird
18:50  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010, like riven said hours ago, it probably has to do with IE6 and 7's buggy handling of elements with both float and clear
18:50  farhad2010: Zombieloffe:so what should i do?
18:51  farhad2010: kaseano:check the page in http://browsershots.org/
18:51  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010, try applying display: inline; to .OptionPanelContext
18:51  byteme74: I've tried a few suggesting on how to make a gridview in asp.net have its headers vertical but they remain horizontal
18:51  byteme74: anyone know a solution?
18:52  ZombieLoffe: doesn't sound very CSS-related, byteme74
18:52  byteme74: rendered its just a table right?
18:53  iaj: kaseano: heh, thanks :) that worked... http://fuel-management.de/jay/registrierungsseite_verimatic.html   but do you happen to know how I could avoid to have to margin-top 3.4em on the div before the second checkbox... or to make it sane, starting from 0px?
18:53  ZombieLoffe: I've no diea.
18:53  ZombieLoffe: Idea, even
18:53 * stickDeath ate amanha / bye!.
18:53  farhad2010: ZombieLoffe:the problem is remaining :(
18:53  kaseano: iaj just learned from ZombieLoffe table-cells are ok now, which might create a better solution for you in case your label grows
18:54  ZombieLoffe: Eehhh... display: table-cell; is ok, <td> is not (for layout)
18:54  kaseano: you don't want the spacing between the two check boxes?
18:54  byteme74: this is what the rendered header looks lik http://www.pastie.org/1470606
18:54  ZombieLoffe: display: table-cell; is also not supported in ie < 8
18:54  kaseano: iaj ok well mayb you have the best solution atm for xbrowser reasons :)
18:55  ZombieLoffe: byteme74, make a test-case replicating the problem (in CSS terms, not .net) on www.webdevout.net/test
18:55  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010: meh. the most obvious solution seems to be to NOT apply float and clear on the same element. Instead, apply float to one of the elements, wrap each row in a container and apply clear to the container.
18:56  dumont: ZombieLoffe is it possible to take a verdana font and modify it globally with a font-stretch:condensed;, because when I do font-family:ABCD,verdana; i don't want font-stretch to affect ABCD
18:56  kaseano: iaj there shouldn't be any spacing between the divs unless you defined it, you should always reset everything (for xbrowsers) at the beginning of your .css file with something like https://gist.github.com/783157
18:57  dumont: btw, I wasn't able to for some reason make font-stretch work :S
18:57  kaseano: I pulled mine off blueprint, but most designers do that
18:57  ZombieLoffe: dumont, afaik only if the system supports different stretch values or if you include the font via @font-face
18:58  ZombieLoffe: Like with font-weight: bold; doesn't actually bold the font, it chooses a different font-face from the same font-family -- a bold version. Same goes for condensed -- if there's no condensed version of that font-family, it will just display the regular.
18:59  dumont: ZombieLoffe thanks... any idea on how I could alter the font for example with font-size-adjust prior to global use?
19:00  ZombieLoffe: Nope. Haven't looked into font-size-adjust.
19:00 * MauriceJ watches ZombieLoffe and thinks of the desert scene in Jesus Christ Super Star.
19:02  webPragmatist: hey guys i have a table but i'd like for the td to be the same height as the "tallest" td in the row… how can i do this?
19:02  webPragmatist: http://screencast.com/t/sXcvSeVz
19:02  ZombieLoffe: That is not tabular data, you shouldn't be using a table.
19:02  dumont: ZombieLoffe well... its like any other font property....
19:03  farhad2010: ZombieLoffe:i worked on this problem for 3 days and realy dont know what to do :( can u give me the correct solution in a file?
19:03  webPragmatist: ZombieLoffe: answer the question please?
19:03  MauriceJ: webPragmatist: http://badhtml.comeze.com/
19:03  webPragmatist: TIME OUT
19:03  dumont: ZombieLoffe can I make a font name alias with predefined characteristics like font-size? so that when I do font-family name, it uses that font size
19:03  webPragmatist: << this is tabular data… you just don't know it
19:04  ZombieLoffe: Doesn't look like it.
19:04  dumont: ZombieLoffe btw, remember that equal height columns problem? Lazylegs helped me fix it
19:04  webPragmatist: answer the question please… i've gone through this already… making it an <li> is an equal pain in the ass because it's a grid
19:04  dumont: or rather he fixed it for me :)
19:04  ZombieLoffe: I don't, I never read about your equal height problem
19:05  ZombieLoffe: webPragmatist, the default behaviour of a table is to make all tds of equal height.
19:05  dumont: ZombieLoffe sure you did, you were throwing links at me, fauxcolumns and etc
19:05  ZombieLoffe: Not today, surely?
19:05  dumont: about 8 hours ago maybe
19:05  ZombieLoffe: Nope
19:06  dumont: must you make me crucify you by diging up quotes? :D
19:06  webPragmatist: ZombieLoffe: ah you are right… i had it floated from my <li> conundrum
19:06  ZombieLoffe: farhad2010: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01D

19:06  ZombieLoffe: dumont: I wasn't online 8 hours ago...
19:07  Mafia: hi
19:07  dumont: ZombieLoffe well, i had this problem for over 24 hours... so you were trying to help me at one time or another :)
19:07  ZombieLoffe: Well, either way, ]sameheight as all you need.
19:08  dumont: the solution was to use relative position, and some clever arrangment of divs and background scroll image repeat-y
19:08  ZombieLoffe: That's faux columns, lawl.
19:08  dumont: and osme other stuff to make it work
19:09  dumont: i never did fauxcolumns so it was extra ard for me to make an extra div stand out at the bottom of the frame on top of the background-image
19:09  dumont: hard*
19:09  MauriceJ: Heh.
19:10  Mafia: I have a saw effect over an image that goes from left to right all the way... but dunno how to make match the \/\/\/\/\/\/\/ on both
19:10  Mafia: any idea?
19:11  MauriceJ: Mafia: Test case URL?
19:11  ZombieLoffe: Mafia, is it fixed width?
19:11  Mafia: it is not up :(
19:11  Mafia: Zombie no
19:11  webPragmatist: now there's like tis ghost border  in firefox
19:11  webPragmatist: wtf
19:11  Mafia: I have a main wrapper of 1000px
19:11  Mafia: but dunno how to make the left / right resizes match
19:11  ZombieLoffe: Uhh.. so it is fixed width?
19:12  Mafia: only main center is fixed, right and left might be resized
19:12  MauriceJ: Mafia: Do you not have a website?
19:12  ZombieLoffe: Ah, right.
19:13  ZombieLoffe: Mafia: Then you can't, reliably. Maybe with CSS3's border-image, but support for that is (as far as I know) very limited. Certainly no IE < 9 support.
19:13  Mafia: ok ZombieLoffe :( and any trick?
19:13  ZombieLoffe: Not that I know of.
19:17  Mafia: :(
19:17  dumont: ZombieLoffe how can I specify 2 different font sizes for different font families within the same id?
19:17 --- bios_ is now known as bios
19:20  ZombieLoffe: dumont, same way you style anything in CSS... select it using a pseudo-selector (:first-letter, :first-line, etc.) or use additional elements.
19:20  dumont: nooo
19:20  dumont: for ex
19:20  dumont: I have a text in span id=abc
19:20  dumont: #abd {font-family:abcd,verdana;}
19:21  dumont: how can I specify 20pt for abcd font and 10pt for verdana font?
19:21  dumont: #abc*
19:21  ZombieLoffe: You can't. Maybe that new, fancy font-size-adjust can do it, but support would be very limited.
19:21  ZombieLoffe: (if any at all)
19:22  dumont: yes font size adjust can adjust the size between different font families
19:22  dumont: but it still cannot do it for 2 different fonts applied to the same text
19:22  dumont: at least i don't think it can
19:23  dumont: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-size-adjust
19:26  dumont: In situations where font fallback occurs, fallback fonts may not share the same aspect ratio as the desired font family and will thus appear less readable. The font-size-adjust property is a way to preserve the readability of text when font fallback occurs. It does this by adjusting the font-size so that the x-height is the same irregardless of the font used.
19:26  dumont: hmm interesting
19:26  dumont: this suggest that when fallback occurs
19:26  dumont: it can apply size adjust
19:26  dumont: but it makes no example of how to apply thi when you already applied a primary font to the text
19:27  craig-t: with CSS3 gradients, can they work with px's, or only %?
19:27  dumont: thus i do not see a way to apply the adjust only to the fallback font within the same text
19:27  ZombieLoffe: ]tias @ craig-t
19:27  _ZofBot4: craig-t, Try it and see. If you did that, you'd (a) learn the answer, and (b) stop wasting my time.
19:28  ZombieLoffe: Well, (b) is a bit rude, but (a) holds true.
19:28  craig-t: I have tried.. hence I'm asking.. nothing seems to work.
19:30  ZombieLoffe: seems to work fine when I Try in Firefox, craig-t.
19:32  Mafia: ZombieLoffe do you accept a pm ? to show you the image?
19:32  ZombieLoffe: why not just post in here?
19:32  Mafia: is a customer design
19:32  Mafia: :(
19:32  ZombieLoffe: who says I won't steal it and sell it to the russian design mob?
19:32  Mafia: ok
19:37  dumont: I actually had a valid reason to use this background-color: #FFFFFF !important; in a:active
19:37  ZombieLoffe: what would that be?
19:38  dumont: because unique id that I used for the link, had a different background-color and I didn't feel like listing all inluded states of a just to exclude a:active
19:38  dravekx: i hate you corel!!
19:38  dumont: dravekx try photoshop :P
19:39  dumont: and you call yourself a graphics/web designer XD
19:39  dumont: :P
19:39  ZombieLoffe: Pfft... "I didn't feel like" does not count as an excuse.
19:39  dravekx: yeah. Im in ps now.
19:39  ZombieLoffe: Plus, you could've easily just used a higher-level element's id in the selector for the :active selector.
19:39  dumont: ZombieLoffe how would you include all the a states without active state in a unique id? #home_link {...}
19:40  ZombieLoffe: dumont: just override it
19:40  ZombieLoffe: #home_link { background: red; } #home_link:active { background: blue; }
19:40  dumont: ohh as in #home_linkLactive {} ?
19:40  dumont: ahh
19:40  dumont: good point
19:40  dumont: but I think in the end result I want all links to display white background
19:41  dumont: active links
19:41  ZombieLoffe: Then just #container a:active { background: white; }
19:41  ZombieLoffe: Or some other higher-level element's id
19:41  dumont: thats why I did a:active
19:42  dumont: and had to do !important to overrride the #uniqueid specificity
19:42  ZombieLoffe: #container a:active {} would override #homelink
19:42  dumont: what about all the other containers that are a tags?
19:42  ZombieLoffe: Uhh, what?
19:42  dumont: i need those to have white background also...
19:42  dumont: hense i just use a:active
19:42  ZombieLoffe: ...
19:43  Mafia: hi
19:43  ZombieLoffe: #your_main_wrapper_id a:active {} will override #homelink {}
19:43  ZombieLoffe: get it?
19:43  dumont: ffs
19:43  dumont: yes I get it
19:43  Mafia: need inspiration to cut properly that www.transpalets.net/portada.jpg /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ areas :/
19:43  dumont: BUT I WILL HAVE more than 1 a tag link that I WANT to have white background...
19:43  dumont: when its clicked/active
19:43  ZombieLoffe: dumont, YES AND THAT WILL SELECT all <a> elements inside #your_main_wrapper_id
19:44  tango_: hello all
19:44  craig-t: I'm using this for a gradient.. but still no luck: background:-webkit-gradient(linear, 0px 5px, 0 200px, from(#565656), to(#000000), color-stop(.6,#333));
19:44  ZombieLoffe: eg. use a higher-level element's id in your selector to increase specificity
19:44  dumont: sorry :) not specific enough in my example, my uniqueid is applied directly to the a tag <a id=uniqueid
19:44 --- Thor_ is now known as NetHawk
19:44  dumont: so...
19:44  dumont: :)
19:44  ZombieLoffe: dumont: that is completely irrelevant
19:45 --- phpedinei_ is now known as phpedinei
19:45  dumont: no its not since you can't have a tag inside a tag
19:45  tango_: I don't suppose css offers a way to use an arbitrary symbol for unordere list, right? I would have to use content: in the :before to achieve what I want, after setting the symbol to none?
19:45  dumont: nvm
19:45  ZombieLoffe: dumont: You really aren't getting it
19:45  dumont: i see what you are trying to prove and i agree
19:45  ZombieLoffe: I don't think you do, lol
19:45  dumont: its just that in my example/case it's a diff structure
19:45  systemfault:  dumont What do you want to do?
19:46  ZombieLoffe: dumont: doesn't matter, I'm pretty sure you have at least one containing element that has an id
19:46  dumont: and whether is a:active or body a:active or #wrapper a:active it's all the same crap
19:47  dumont: systemfault maybe you know this: can you apply font-size-adjust to a fallbackfont? on a text which has font set as font-family:abcd,verdana; for example the wanted outcome is to appy the font-size-adjust to verdana only, and not to abcd font
19:47  craig-t: does anyone know if it's at all possible to define pixels instead on percentages for gradients?
19:48  systemfault: dumont: I don't think it's possible.
19:48  dumont: then why doe the css3 make it sound like it is?
19:48  ZombieLoffe: dumont, http://www.webdevout.net/test?01F
19:48  systemfault: Perhaps it is, I don't know CSS3 perfectly..
19:48  dumont: In situations where font fallback occurs, fallback fonts may not share the same aspect ratio as the desired font family and will thus appear less readable. The font-size-adjust property is a way to preserve the readability of text when font fallback occurs. It does this by adjusting the font-size so that the x-height is the same irregardless of the font used.
19:49  systemfault: dumont: It's the "web"
19:49  dumont: huh?
19:49  systemfault: It's not pixel perfect, we have to live with it.
19:49  systemfault: I guess you could embed the needed font with CSS3...
19:50  dumont: ZombieLoffe that's exactly what i thought you were saying only my comeback is, why does it matter if you apply it to a uniqueid that is of the body, or a:active in general?
19:50  dumont: both will apply to the global page scope anyway
19:50  systemfault: What?
19:51  dumont: except with a:active I need to specify !important
19:51  ZombieLoffe: dumont: the point of the id selector is to increase specificity
19:51  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Yeah, and !important is stupid
19:51  ZombieLoffe: #higherelement a:active {} is better than a:active { ... !important; }
19:52  dumont: specificity is pointless whether you are doing a:active -> which means for all tags, or body a:active which means for all tags inside body, and since all a tags are inside body anyway, you are doing the same thing
19:52  ZombieLoffe: craig-t: Looks like webkit doesn't support pixel lengths (yet)
19:52  systemfault: dumont: ....
19:53  dumont: so.. aside from !important being stupid, do you have any other recomendations on why doing it your way is better than mine?
19:53  systemfault: FFS, read about specificity.
19:53  ZombieLoffe: dumont: The point of the increased specificity is to override #unique -- wasn't that the point of !Important in the first place? :P
19:53 --- phpedinei_ is now known as phpedinei
19:53  systemfault: dumont: Do it, because you're looking dumb right now..
19:53  ZombieLoffe: dumont: !important is stupid, that's the only reason you need -- unlike id selectors !important _can't_ be overwritten, that's why you should generally avoid it
19:53  ZombieLoffe: should you wish to some time set another :active color on some other element you would first need to hunt down the !important property and get rid of it
19:54  ZombieLoffe: much better to work with just specificity
19:54  dumont: hmm ok, i'll just do body a:active :) then
19:54  dumont: stop punching me :P
19:54  ZombieLoffe: you'll need a id selector to trump #uniqueid
19:54  dumont: :O bitch X{
19:54  dumont: hehe
19:54  ZombieLoffe: ]css specificity @ dumont
19:54  _ZofBot4: dumont, CSS Specificity: http://htmldog.com/guides/cssadvanced/specificity/ , http://w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#specificity
19:54  systemfault: dumont: IIRC, a class is worth 1, tag = 10, id = 100 and inline style = 1000
19:55  systemfault: Just remember that... add the numbers.<
19:55  systemfault: And the higher the number, the higher the specificity.
19:55  ZombieLoffe: Indeed.
19:55  dumont: inline style is the style in the tag?
19:55  systemfault: dumont: Yes
19:55  systemfault: dumont: so a:active it worth 10
19:55  systemfault: body a:active is worth 20
19:56  dumont: hmm where ae the points for css included in the page vs stylesheet file vs inline vs browser default?
19:56  dumont: i used to read up on that like 4 years ago XD
19:56  systemfault: I don't really understand the question to be honest
19:57  ZombieLoffe: Stylesheet and <style> give no additional specificity
19:57  dumont: totally forgot, only faint recollection of the order
19:57  dumont: browser default is the lowest
19:57  dumont: not specificity but browser something...
19:57  ZombieLoffe: If specificity in two author stylesheets is the same, the latest will be used
19:57  dumont: hmm is it the same thing? :S
19:57  dumont: confused now
19:57  systemfault: I think I made a mistake with the specificity values...
19:58  dumont: ZombieLoffe ughmmm, define two author stylesheets?
19:58  systemfault: tag is 1 and class is 10
19:58  ZombieLoffe: All browser stylesheets are treated as if they had 0 specificty
19:58  systemfault: (I'm sooo noob)
19:58  dumont: file css vs inpage css?
19:58  ZombieLoffe: dumont, <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="first.css"><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="second.css">
19:58  dumont: ZombieLoffe ok
19:59  dumont: i think inpage css has a higher specificity than file css
19:59  ZombieLoffe: You can see the cascading order in the spec (linked earlier)
19:59  ZombieLoffe: No, they have equal specificity, but come later in the cascade.
20:00  systemfault: dumont: If you have two rules with the same specificity, the last one is taken.
20:00  dumont: reason i feel like talking rather than checking is ecause my frigging firefox is bogged down with 1GB of virtual ram usage with only about 20 tabs open
20:00  ZombieLoffe: yuck
20:00  dumont: stupid firefox is pissing me off cuz it does not free up memory...
20:00  systemfault: dumont: Don't use Firefox?
20:00  dumont: can't
20:01  systemfault: It never was good.
20:01  ZombieLoffe: Get more ram
20:01  dumont: its most ui pleasant
20:01  systemfault: It simply was the only alternative to IE.
20:01  systemfault: Now, there's a lot of alternatives.
20:01  dumont: with more ram it'll use 2GB and i'll need to restart it every 2 days instead of 1
20:01  ZombieLoffe: Firefox + flash is currently taking 1.2GB memory and I have lots to spare \o/
20:01  systemfault: ZombieLoffe: Win!
20:02  ZombieLoffe: To be fair, plugin container is the bulk of that. I have like 25 tabs open, most with some sort of flash video.
20:02  AlexTurpin: Hey folks, I was wondering whether there was a way to select both first-child and before for an element? As in, add content before the first element
20:02  eighty4:  ZombieLoffe: Got 4gb more ram today :)
20:02  ZombieLoffe: AlexTurpin: :first-child:before {} ... however, note that :before does not add "content before the element", it adds "content before the content inside the element"
20:03  AlexTurpin: ZombieLoffe: Okay, that explains my problem then. Thanks, I'll figure something!

20:04  _ZofBot4: html script: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/scripts.html#edef-SCRIPT
20:07  m0nkfish: how can i specify that a div should be 'closely wrapped' around its contents
20:07  m0nkfish: (width-wise)
20:09  ZombieLoffe: m0nkfish: generally by display: inline; -- if you need to set a width/height, float: left/right; or display: inline-block;
20:12  dumont: ZombieLoffe this is what Lazylegs came up with: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01z
20:12  dumont: exactly what I need
20:12  dumont: the red section expands
20:12  dumont: vertically
20:12  dumont: when contents section does
20:14  ZombieLoffe: Note that ie6 does not support heighting a pos: abs; element with bottom and top values
20:14  ZombieLoffe: but yeah, other than that it's a good method
20:15  dumont: do people still use ie6? :O
20:15  ZombieLoffe: a depressingly large number do, but I'd say dropping support is fine
20:15  ZombieLoffe: because ie6 is a pile of poop
20:15  dumont: how can you use the internet and not use the latest browsers?
20:15  systemfault: dumont: Only corporate environments still use IE6.
20:16  systemfault: (Or retarded people)
20:16  dumont: that explains large number of botnets XD
20:16  systemfault: Technically, MS has to support it until XP EOL
20:16  systemfault: But since even the giants like google and facebook don't support it, we can consider it dead.
20:16  dumont: wasn't eol 2011?
20:17  systemfault: dumont: April 8th 2014
20:17  dumont: oh right, they moved it up like 4th time
20:17  dumont: or moved it down...
20:17  dumont: depending on which way you are haning
20:17  dumont: hanging
20:17  dumont: rofl
20:17  dumont: or sideways on a numer line
20:17  dumont: number*
20:18  systemfault: I always wondered... Are you french?
20:18  dumont: non
20:18  systemfault: Je vois.
20:18  dumont: pour que?
20:18  systemfault: dumont sounds french.
20:18  dumont: hehe oui
20:19  dumont: ok tmeplate done... now I need to separate this template into php header footer, main page stuff
20:20  systemfault: Eww PHP
20:21  dumont: unless I feel like maintaining 10 copies of the template... yes.. php
20:21  m0nkfish: ZombieLoffe: the two DIVs that are contained within the parent DIV are floated (so they are side by side)
20:21  legostud: I wonder what systemfault likes over PHP
20:21  systemfault: legostud: Anything.
20:21  legostud: ASP
20:21  legostud: ;-)
20:21  m0nkfish: what i am trying to achieve is to place these two DIVs in the centre of the page
20:21  systemfault: ASP.net at least? :(
20:21  systemfault: Ok.. ASP is worse.
20:21  legostud: it's still Microsoft
20:22  systemfault: ASP.net is better :/
20:22  systemfault: legostud: I was simply judging the language :/
20:22  dumont: what's asp.net?
20:23  systemfault: Hmm, it's ASP.... for .net :/
20:23  legostud: haha
20:23  dumont: is taht like MS's equivalent to php's web scripting lang?
20:23  systemfault: dumont: Yes but you can use the MS language you want  for the backend.
20:23  systemfault: C# is nice
20:23  dumont: eww
20:23  dumont: c++ all the way
20:23  systemfault: I wouldn't do a website with C++.
20:24  dumont: rofl
20:24  legostud: I don't think you can
20:24  dumont: i owuldn't do a website with c++ either
20:24  m0nkfish: of course you can
20:24  systemfault: legostud: Of course you can....
20:24  m0nkfish: its not advisable though
20:24  systemfault: legostud: You could even make one using assembly if you're motivated enough
20:25  systemfault: That would be pointless and stupid.. but possible
20:25  legostud: just give me some nice Java Applets.  ;-)
20:25  m0nkfish: web development is a very specialised area with masses of languages and tools - using anything but those tools is an exercise in reinventing the wheel
20:26  systemfault:  You could use scala :P
20:26  systemfault: Or Ruby

21:34  Sou|cutter: oh okay
21:34  Sou|cutter: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01I like so?
21:35  MauriceJ: Sou|cutter: Thanks! brb
21:35  iaj: I read the 'magic of overflow hidden' but are there some other helpful guides?
21:36  MauriceJ: iaj: For float containment?
21:36  iaj: generally for div overflow:hidden usage - I find myself so often in situations where I just don't know what to do :(
21:37  Sou|cutter: the intention is to make a slideshow with the jquery cycle plugin and a slightly customized transition, but it's a bit of a moot point since I can't get the clipping of the last image to work
21:37  pngl: MauriceJ: thanks.
21:37  MauriceJ: iaj: Hrm... not sure what to suggest there mate.
21:37  MauriceJ: pngl: I hope I gave you correct info. :)
21:37  MauriceJ: Sou|cutter: Hrm.
21:38  Sou|cutter: the idea being that the next slide in the slideshow is partially visible (probably stating the obvious...)
21:40  MauriceJ: Okay I get you.  Let's see here....
21:41  Sou|cutter: maybe I need to specify image sizes...
21:42  Sou|cutter: nope, that doesn't do it
21:42  Xpo3: Maurice bummer, that doesnt work.
21:43  pngl: MauriceJ: I'll check it by making some browser tests and see how they behave.
21:43  MauriceJ: Xpo3: Ah bugger.  Yeah I don't know of any other ways but that doesn't mean there are any.
21:43  MauriceJ: pngl: Very good idea.
21:44  MauriceJ: Sou|cutter: Yeah I see the problem and my first gut reaction was to put the images into a UL and make it horizontal.
21:44  MauriceJ: I don't know how your jquery will deal with that though.
21:45  buddyq: which way would you do this? Nav1, nav2, nav3    Follow Us: twitter     facebook      all on one line? I put the nav in its own UL and then want put the twitter, facebook in another <UL>. Wondering if this makes sense semanticaly?
21:45  buddyq: <p> tag for Follow Us:?
21:46  Xpo3: Maurice its weird, i cant find anything on it, it seems like it would be a pretty common problem, wanted your image to maintain its dimensions when it is repeated
21:46  Sou|cutter: MauriceJ: Hmm, that could work. I *think* the query can handle that
21:46  Sou|cutter: s/query/jquery/
21:47  Sou|cutter: I find it strange that what I tried here doesn't work, though. CSS is mysterious to me at times :P
21:48  MauriceJ: Xpo3: Yeah I'm still learning about that stuff myself, sadly.  Only just learnt about 'round' the other night for instance.
21:48  MauriceJ: Sou|cutter: Amen to that hehe.  Trying to make you a working copy in webdev jsut now.
21:48  Alex___: Hello
21:48  Alex___: I'm a beginner to CSS

21:48  Alex___: Does anyone knows where I can learn it or something?
21:49  vastak: From a book.

22:30  oksushi: Alex___: ass-backwards. HTML comes /first/

22:43  oksushi: *touché
22:43  ZombieLoffe: Alex___: HTML 4.01 Strict or HTML5 if you're futuristic
22:43  daviddoria: oksushi - text-align just sets the alignment of the first (not wrapped) line : http://daviddoria.com/RCOSWebsite/index.html
22:43  KarateKip: the last hurdle is the following: I want the bottom side of the scissors to almost touch the horizontal line. But the problem is that the home button stretches all the way across the screen. http://geefmijmaarkorting.blogspot.com/

22:47  jedimind_: yeah, knowledge of a skillset does not excuse you from acting like a human being
22:47  MauriceJ: Terrorising people wasn't helping the environment.
22:47  daviddoria: hm, it looks like list-style-position:outside on the ul is what i'm looking for? but it doesn't seem to work
22:47  jedimind_: and that said, people explode and say stupid things all the time (myself included) and yell and be mean, but it's a problem of ALWAYS doing that
22:47  MauriceJ: I'm sure not arguing with the decison.
22:48  jedimind_: anyway, he may get a ban lift in a little bit, but for now he's gone
22:48  ZombieLoffe: Alex___: Indeed. There's no attribute called xmlns in html.

22:50  ZombieLoffe: Alex___, you don't close self-closing elements with /> in html. eg. <meta> not <meta />
22:50  jedimind_: i think you forgot the other part of that, like the line above where the <meta tag opens ?
22:50  Alex___: 	<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />
22:50  ZombieLoffe: Get rid of the / :P
22:51  dumont: doesn't valid xhtml require / ?
22:51  jedimind_: yeah, if you're not using xhtml, you dont need the />
22:51  dumont: k
22:51  ZombieLoffe: Yes, but he's making HTML, not XHTML
22:51  dumont: yeah
22:51  ZombieLoffe: Also, HTML5 accepts both > and />
22:51  ZombieLoffe: (As a small aside)
22:51  dumont: talk to me in 5 years about html5
22:51  dumont: XD
22:53  dumont: ZombieLoffe I did some browser compatability tests, my site looks like shit on browsers more than a year old, mostly because of border-radious, and @face-font, but also in IE because of position properties
22:53  ZombieLoffe: Welcome to web development.
22:53  dumont: though position properties work for IE7 and 8
22:53  dumont: font however doesn't
22:54  dumont: ZombieLoffe there has got to be a way to set different font sizes for fallback fonts!
22:54  oksushi: there is no 'face-font'
22:54  KarateKip: how can i bring the scissors a little lower without having the image clipped? http://geefmijmaarkorting.blogspot.com/
22:54  dumont: oksushi MUAHAHA FONT-FACE :P
22:54  ZombieLoffe: dumont, not currently implemented. Give it up.
22:54  dumont: PoS
22:55  systemfault: dumont: Like I told you... you're doing it wrong.
22:55  ZombieLoffe: See what I mean about (supposedly) pixel-pefect being wrong for the web? -.-
22:55  dumont: then how are you supposed to keep the say character height for fallback fonts?
22:55  systemfault: dumont: You're not supposed to rely on that.
22:55 --- Voziv_ is now known as Voziv
22:55  systemfault: dumont: Different systems have different fonts.
22:56  oksushi: firefox supports font-size-adjust…
22:56  dumont: are you saying that em font size will give a consistem character height across fallback fonts?
22:56  ZombieLoffe: KarateKip: Increase the top value on #header-inner, remove overflow: hidden; from #header and #header-wrapper
22:56  dumont: oksushi I dare you to tell me how you can apply font-size-adjust to a fallback font without applying it to the main font
22:57  KarateKip: ZombieLoffe: ok, will try, thanx!
22:57  oksushi: why would I?
22:57  dumont: for the same uniqueid
22:57  dumont: oksushi because you mentioned font-size-adjust :P
22:58  dumont: ZombieLoffe are you saying that em font size will give a consistem character height across fallback fonts?
22:58  ZombieLoffe: dumont: Acceptably consistent.
22:58  dumont: or % font size or relative medium/large
22:59  ZombieLoffe: They won't be exactly the same because font-faces simply look different, but it'll be close enough.
22:59  dumont: geez why can't they have a singular font format engine
22:59  oksushi: dumont: if it means that much to you, why not create your own typeface by editing the one you are using and making it's x-height match a reliable fallback font?
23:00  oksushi: fontforge would be a good cross-platform tool to do that
23:00  dumont: nooo not only do we need more font formats but we also need more font render engines for diff OSes
23:00  dumont: so they can look different on diff OSes too
23:00  oksushi: pfft
23:01  oksushi: who, seriously, cares? It's a damn star trek Web site
23:01  oksushi: if the deisgin breaks so damn easily, it's a shitty design
23:01  ZombieLoffe: That's what I said, like 10 hours ago, dang nammit
23:02  Alex___: http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=http://alex.nl.eu.org/&ucn_task=conformance =D
23:02  KarateKip: ZombieLoffe thanx! it worked like a charm! Dunno how you knew about this, but it worked ;)
23:03  Alex___: Is there something for changing favicon in 30 seconds?
23:03  oksushi: Alex___: nice to see you have sane priorities
23:04  Alex___: sane ?
23:04  oksushi: sorry, forgot the <sarcasm> tag
23:04  Alex___: what does that means?
23:04  qq99: hahaha
23:04  dumont: what do you mean changing the favicon?
23:05  ZombieLoffe: KarateKip: Firebug. :)
23:05  Alex___: favicon is that upper picture
23:05  Alex___: of the page
23:05  Alex___: i want that to changed
23:05  mrapple: can anyone else login to adobe browserlab/
23:05  qq99: my goodness
23:05  Alex___: change *
23:05  dumont: btw, anyone know what browsers support what kinds of favicon formats?
23:05  mrapple: or is it just my interbuts being stupid again
23:05  oksushi: dumont: google does
23:05  qq99: mrapple, I think it's a limited trial dealy?  I couldn't login today
23:05  KarateKip: ZombieLoffe i'm also using firebug but still i just don't understand how things work and i read a lot on w3c.org website
23:05  digga`: hi's, I have a ordered list with a link and regular text, I would like to the regular text to align left, and the link to align right with out adding any styles around the link or the text, just the li
23:05  qq99: mrapple, it also told me my trial was up, though
23:05  mrapple: qq99: a what what?
23:06  digga`: possible?
23:06  digga`: :D
23:06  mrapple: since when do you have to pay for it
23:06  ZombieLoffe: KarateKip: when overflowing content is hidden it's usually due to, well, overflow: hidden; somewhere.
23:06  mrapple: oh im logged in
23:06  mrapple: nvm
23:06  qq99: mrapple, you don't have to pay? I couldn't log in today,something about trial
23:06  mrapple: weird
23:06  qq99: mrapple, you bought a CS product?
23:06  mrapple: i always thought it was free
23:06  mrapple: nope
23:06  Alex___: can anyone show me a page with messy html code?
23:06  KarateKip: ZombieLoffe: oh okay, now i know that. Thanx! I was looking for a way to implement z-index ;)
23:06  qq99: mrapple, hmmm
23:06  mrapple: i torrented cs5 though
23:06  qq99: mrapple, when did you sign up?
23:06  mrapple: dont tell anyone though
23:06  mrapple: idk
23:07  mrapple: hell, it works, im cool :P
23:07  qq99: mrapple, frig lol, now I gotta find out why it isn't working for me / make a new account
23:07  ZombieLoffe: Alex___: http://havenworks.com/
23:08  qq99: Alex___, favicon is served by the server upon a browser's request for it, not spec in code (afaik)
23:08  mrapple: I think this is the first time *ever* that one of my websites has worked in every major browser (including all the IE's) with no conditional stylesheets
23:08  Alex___: ZombieLoffe: messy code
23:08  Alex___: not messy site
23:08  Alex___: the code is valid
23:08  Alex___: i think sod
23:08  Alex___: so *
23:09  ZombieLoffe: the code is far from valid
23:09  qq99: Alex___, so just change the favicon file in document root
23:09  ZombieLoffe: 3000 errors on the start page
23:09  Alex___: i want it to change after 30 seconds
23:10  qq99: you should have been more specific
23:11  qq99: Alex___, literally first result on google "change favicon with javascript" http://softwareas.com/dynamic-favicons
23:11  qq99: no idea if that works but there's a start
23:11  mrapple: qq99: "Looks too good to be true? Well it is true, at least for a certain period of time anyway. Adobe BrowserLab is a limited free preview service. While Adobe is testing the service, they are letting people hop on board. The final product would most likely require you to shell out some bucks."
23:12  KarateKip: HELP!! i have a nasty bug!! it's called firebug!!!!
23:12  caverdude: it would be nice if xml could be used to create deep menu systems or deep tree type list on web pages hehe
23:12  qq99: mrapple, aww, yeah, I figured, it must take a lot of resources both bandwidth and cpu for browserlab
23:12  mrapple: KarateKip: DONT PANIC. Just slowly, slowly, slowly... make your way to the uninstall dialoug
23:13  caverdude: maybe javascript could be used to display a collapsable tree menu?
23:13  caverdude: or list?
23:13  mrapple: caverdude: hey i did one of those one time
23:13  caverdude: cool
23:13  KarateKip: hehe...  ;)
23:13  mrapple: it's used in http://code.google.com/p/bzweb/ somewhere
23:14  caverdude: sounds like a project I need to embark on
23:14  mrapple: found it http://code.google.com/p/tapestry5-treegrid/source/browse/trunk/tapestry5-treegrid/src/main/resources/org/codelutin/tapestry/components/js/TreeGrid.js?r=3
23:14  mrapple: thats what i used anyways
23:15  caverdude: is it part of css now to not use user list anymore?
23:15  caverdude: <ul><li> etc
23:15  mrapple: http://code.google.com/p/bzweb/source/browse/trunk/global/servers.js
23:15  caverdude: or is that just for menu's?
23:16  Alumin: is it possible to select an element based on its contents?
23:16  oksushi: Alumin: no
23:16  MauriceJ: caverdude: lists are still valid for lists and menus and such.
23:16  Alumin: for example, if I have "<span>Some Text</span>", can I select based on "Some Text"
23:16  caverdude: k
23:16  Alumin: oksushi: bummer...I thought that'd probably be a no, but I guess it was worth asking :)
23:16  caverdude: thanks mrapple
23:16  mrapple: caverdude: wait a collabsable menu? heres the original -> http://sstree.tigris.org/nonav/example4.html
23:17  mrapple: thats a collabsable table
23:17  qq99: Alumin, it's better not to, but you could with jquery... search every <span> for innerHtml() matching whatever you're looking for
23:17  Alumin: qq99: yeah, that was my fallback plan :)
23:17  caverdude: nice
23:17  Alumin: To the Greasemonkey!
23:18  qq99: Alumin, it would be much better, if you have access to the server/html whatever, to just fix the code so that what you want to select based on is wrapped in it's own class
23:18 --- Zezi is now known as zezikaro
23:19  qq99: Alumin, still I guess I'm unclear what you mean by 'select'
23:19  Alumin: qq99: you have no idea how wholeheartedly I agree with that :P
23:19  Alumin: qq99: well, here's the goal, maybe I'm thinking about it from the wrong direction
23:20  Alumin: there's a <ul> has child <li> elements, each of which lists a particular item
23:20  digga`: hi's, I have a ordered list with a link and regular text, I would like to the regular text to align left, and the link to align right with out adding any styles around the link or the text, just the li
23:20  digga`: :D
23:20  digga`: possible?
23:20  Alumin: some of those items say (Inactive) at the end, and I want to hide them
23:20  Alumin: but there's no actual markup to identify the inactive ones...just the text
23:21  oksushi: digga`: where is the testcase url?
23:21  caverdude: js can read any files from server right? so I could have a tree list in an xml file and js could read it and display it?
23:21  qq99: Alumin, so you don't have access to the generation of the <ul>?
23:21  caverdude: maybe I better go to #javascript
23:21  Alumin: caverdude: Javascript runs in the client browser...if it were going to read a file, it would have to instruct the browser to retrieve it
23:21  oksushi: caverdude: you would want to put the navigation inside the html to make it accessible to search engines etc
23:22  Alumin: qq99: I wish.  If I had access to the code of this web app I would come at it like a spider monkey
23:22  caverdude: hmm
23:22  Alumin: I'm doing this with Stylish
23:22  caverdude: k
23:22  qq99: caverdude, if you want a collapsable tree kinda file structure effect, there's probably a jquery plugin to parse what I assume would be a set of nested <ul>'s
23:22  caverdude: well I wanted to use xml
23:23  caverdude: <ul>'s become ugly when nested too deeply
23:23  qq99: caverdude, then you'll have to parse that xml into dom elements?
23:23  qq99: implying XML isn't ugly
23:23  caverdude: I supose so
23:23  caverdude: ha ya
23:24  qq99: Alumin, ,I have no idea what Stylish is, but you can't get the client to add the same markup that determines (Inactive) in the text and get him to add that to class="inactive" on the <li>?
23:24  Alumin: no, I have zero access to the server unfortunately
23:24  qq99: Alumin, I suppose JS is unavoidable then
23:24  Alumin: Stylish is a Firefox extension that does for CSS what Greasemonkey does for Javascript
23:25  qq99: Alumin, ohh, I see, so it's like... creating a custom theme for someone else's website?
23:25  Alumin: yeah
23:25  Alumin: although generally one just adjusts a few specific things
23:25  qq99: sounds potentially painful
23:25  Alumin: it can be :)
23:26  Alumin: if the page in question has well-designed markup it's great...I wrote a userstyle to highlight the various "extra types of results" on Google result pages in a couple of minutes
23:26  Alumin: this page in question here...not so much.  The markup is a clust...it's not well thought out.  :)
23:27  oojacoboo: is there anyway to get list-type-type to do numbering like 1... 1.1... 1.2... 1.3... 2... 3...3.1... 3.2...
23:28  qq99: Alumin, can you package the stylish/greasemonkey into one neat package? that'd be cool
23:28  qq99: Alumin, otherwise it's unfortunate they have to DL 2 scripts
23:28  qq99: Alumin, well best of luck :)
23:29  Alumin: qq99: thanks :)  I think you probably can't, but then if you're already using GM you could just use that to rewrite the CSS
23:29  MauriceJ: oojacoboo: Yes I've seen it somewhere.
23:29  oojacoboo: LI:before { content: counter(item) ". "; counter-increment: item }
23:29 --- bencahill_ is now known as bencahill
23:29  oojacoboo: something like that?
23:31  MauriceJ: oojacoboo: Yeah I am looking for it now, I only saw it a few times and never used it myself.
23:32  oojacoboo: MauriceJ: I think I found it

23:32  MauriceJ: oojacoboo: Nice one.  Ah, duh, should have checked there.  Good job, mate.
23:33  oojacoboo: funny that the spec isn't using that method though
