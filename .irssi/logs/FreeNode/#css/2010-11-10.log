08:45  Monkey: im using a 30x30 block image as a replacement of the bullet
08:47  oksushi: or, were you referring to the vertical alignment?
08:47  Monkey: yes the vertical alignment
08:47  Monkey: i cant get the text to center with my bullet (block image)
08:48  oksushi: I can't see the images - but to get the text in the centre, set the height and the line-height of the <a> to be the same. Then position the background

14:45  ZombieLoffe: not that I see why you'd bother with that ancient browser
14:45  ZombieLoffe: Adriaan: That should happen automatically...
14:45  sriley: probably cos ie6 still have a fairly large market share
14:46  ZombieLoffe: ridiculously small from what I've been hearing sriley
14:46  riven: small enough for many global brands not to care anymore
14:46  sriley: its really not ridiculously small
14:47  sriley: not really most still support it, they may just not have rounded corners etc for it but thats not... not caring about it
14:47  riven: sriley: wrong.
14:47  Adriaan: ZombieLoffe, not happening because of (i guess) display: inline; but i need it to make a horizontal navigation. And inline-block is not supported in IE6
14:47  riven: `ib @ Adriaan

14:48  Adriaan: rivvles, thank you

14:49  riven: sriley: hahaha
14:50  riven: sriley: no. I work for one of the world's leading digital media agencies. Our clients include many major global brands. We do not support IE6 at all anymore, and the same is true for most of the world's other leading web dev agencies.
14:50  riven: so yeah, I should know.
14:51  sriley: i also work for a fairly large company and they wouldnt think about dropping ie6 support for a while yet

14:51  Adriaan: riven, thank you. working charming
14:52  ZombieLoffe: no MY e-penis is slightly bigger
14:53  riven: sriley: the real point I'm trying to make here, is that an amazing amount of global brands are okay with not getting IE6 support. That should tell you something.
14:53  GarethAdams|Work: Everyone's decision to drop IE6 should be based on whether *they* think there is market advantage to supporting people using that browser vs support cost. There's certainly no "right" answer
14:54  GarethAdams|Work: IE6 support cost depends on a lot of things, primarily the developers who are building the system
14:56  sriley: lets see last month... approx. 65m unique users on ie6... thats quite a few people to loose
15:00  ZombieLoffe: what site would that be?
15:00  riven: sriley: for a typical website (say, ~6% global ie6 marketshare, but about half that in western countries), that would amount to 1b+ *unique users* per month. UUUUUUUUUUUH.
15:01  sriley: yes i did say its a fairly large company
15:01  riven: So yeah, I can pull random stats out of my ass too. Want me to?
15:01  ZombieLoffe: Not even facebook gets that kind of traffic, lawl
15:02  sriley: again i did say quite large company
15:03  ZombieLoffe: you sure did.
15:03  riven: Ah, your company draws more traffic than google, facebook, etc... oh wait, that's not possible.
15:04  riven: sriley: so, let's hear the name of this company.
15:06  riven: Hmm, silence.

15:16  Juandev: is there a place on the web I can add a color in hexadecimal code and then use brightness to retriev the new hexadecimal code?
15:16  riven: lrn2usehsl :p
15:17  sriley: well of course you could always assume that your 6% metric is slightly wrong and so the traffic isnt quite that high and that the company is in the list of those large companies like google, facebook etc
15:17  riven: Or, I could just assume that you are full of bullshit.
15:18  riven: If my ~6% metric is off, you're not talking about a typical brand and therefore it is quite irrelevant.

15:19  chris_abyi: hey there. I try to style some xml document and I think I remember some method on how-to insert additional text into it. E.g. when I got an element <name>foo bar</name>, I don't only want to display "foo bar", but something like "name: foo bar". Do you have any idea how-to achieve this?
15:20  KineticColor: Did someone say something to me?
15:20  KineticColor: I accidentally closed the window when it started flashing
15:20  riven: chris_abyi: css generated content, but despite the name, you should not use it for _real_ content, just for styling.
15:20  riven: chris_abyi: why would you not have the "label" in the actual markup?
15:21  Juandev: so now idea?
15:21  chris_abyi: riven: the markup is given and I can't change anything. It would be sufficient to just catch the name of the elements and display it somehow
15:21  chris_abyi: riven: I didn't understand your first comment, sorry. could you explain it?
15:22  riven: chris_abyi: ah, you want to get the actual tag name and use that?
15:22  chris_abyi: riven: yep!
15:23  chris_abyi: riven: for sure it would be even better to apply any custom text to a special tag but I don't know if this works
15:23  chris_abyi: e.g. when the tag is "firstname", it woulb be nice to have sth like "first name:" in the styled doc, but I got no clue how to do that
15:23  riven: `css generated content
15:23  rivvles: riven, command 'css generated content' not found. Try `search <query> to search for commands.
15:24  riven: `css content
15:24  rivvles: CSS 'content' property: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#propdef-content
15:26  chris_abyi: riven: thanks! :)
15:31  chris_abyi: riven: is there any chance to avoid the lineskip when doing element:before{content="foo"}? Tried it with IE and firefox, IE doesn't seem to display the pseudo elements at all, firefox makes a lineskip between foo and the content of the element..
15:32  riven: Right, no support in IE<8.
15:36  chris_abyi: riven: great. But is there any chance to avoid the lineskip?
15:37  riven: chris_abyi: there shouldn't be. Link?
15:38  chris_abyi: wait a second
15:39  chris_abyi: riven: just posted the css here: http://www.webdevout.net/test?02U sorry, but there's probably some sensitive data in the xml file
15:40  chris_abyi: is it because the element itself is defines as a block element?
15:40  riven: `testcase @ chris_abyi
15:40  rivvles: chris_abyi, a (pared-down) testcase is a page that isolates the problem with the minimum required markup, styling and scripting. See `paste for services that easily let you create such testcases for others to see.
15:41  chris_abyi: riven: I thought in the case of a xml document a testcase wouldn't be necessary because the elements have no semantics anyway..
15:41  chris_abyi: but I can do one, np
15:41  GarethAdams|Work: chris_abyi: remember to change the content type from text/html
15:41  riven: chris_abyi: I just need to be able to see your issue in action, is all
15:45  chris_abyi: GarethAdams|Work: thanks.
15:45  chris_abyi: riven: here it is. Unfortunately, it isn't displayed, but I also didn't get a concrete error message and think that all tags should be closed.. http://www.webdevout.net/test?0k
15:46  riven: what do you mean, "isn't displayed"?
15:47  riven: anyway, you're setting the :before content to `display: block`, so obviously it's gonna sit on its own "line".
15:49  chris_abyi: riven: okay, so how would you then display both tags "city" and "country" one under the other and still have the content in the same line?
15:49  GarethAdams|Work: chris_abyi: set the elements to be block, but don't set the :before to be block
15:49  chris_abyi: GarethAdams|Work: ahh!
15:50  chris_abyi: okay, I've to separate that, sorry! stupid mistake. thanks very much!
16:06  jez9999: Hi.  Is there a way I can position an element as if i were using position:absolute, but relative to its parent element?
16:07  Nanobot: jez9999: Give the parent position:relative and then give the child position:absolute
16:08  jez9999: hmm
16:08  jez9999: and giving the parent position:relative will have no other effect?
16:13  riven: jez9999: all it will do is make the "parent" the reference element for any descendant element for which the "parent" is the nearest positioned ancestor.

16:16  sriley: its due to dib being block and button being a replace inline element, display:inline-block will prob get you most of the way there
16:17  Kingsy: I was being stupid.. all you need to do is set a width for the element..
16:17 * Kingsy smacks himself
16:17  sriley: inline-block would be a better
16:19  Kingsy: got ya, yup
16:21  nvictor: lo people
16:21  nvictor: i cant remember a website
16:21  nvictor: it's a community of font lovers/designers
16:21  nvictor: you basically post a picture and they identify the fonts for you
16:22  nvictor: i'm pretty sure there is "type" in the name
16:22  riven: ``whatthefont
16:22  rivvles: Google says "WhatTheFont! « MyFonts" • http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/ • more results at http://goo.gl/HgATI
16:22  riven: ``identifont
16:22  rivvles: Google says "Identifont - Identify fonts by appearance, find fonts by name" • http://www.identifont.com/ • more results at http://goo.gl/Sn0Wf
16:23  nvictor: thanks riven :)
16:23  nvictor: hmm not those :)
16:23  nvictor: but thanks i didn't know about them
16:33  DeRoSvOs: Hey gang.
16:34  DeRoSvOs: I'm trying to style something, but - as usual - IE is a black sheep.
16:34  nvictor: heh
16:36  Wutklumpen: Hey guys, when i link a css-file with attribute media="print" in the header of a html-page, then this css is used, if the user trys printing the page. Am i right?
16:36  Wutklumpen: or do i need to add some special namespaces or something in the css?
16:38  DeRoSvOs: Basically, I'm re-styling a "input" for a submit button, to make it look like my anchors.  Chrome is perfect.  FF... the padding isn't applied.  I'm saying "padding: 0;" because I have my input wrapped in text... [fake_a_href_skinned_submit_button]
16:39  DeRoSvOs: So in chrome:  [submit] and in FF, [ submit ]
16:40  nvictor: Wutklumpen: i believe so
16:44  DeRoSvOs: Can we make a border transparent?
16:44  oojacoboo: DeRoSvOs: yes
16:44  oojacoboo: border: 1px solid transparent; (I think that will work)
16:45  sriley: iirc doesnt work in ie
16:45  oojacoboo: why would you want to do that anyway??
16:45  oojacoboo: that's why we have margin
16:45  oojacoboo: unless it's a table of course
16:46 * DeRoSvOs grins.
16:46  DeRoSvOs: oojacoboo:  To be completely honest, IE is really pissing me off.  Everything is great... save IE.
16:47  oojacoboo: DeRoSvOs: IE9 is shaping up to be a leader in the industry, so you might be biting your tongue in a couple years
16:47  nvictor: DeRoSvOs: have you tried any of the reset styles?
16:49  Phrogz: oojacoboo: In what sense a 'leader'? In the same sense that it happens to have majority user share?
16:50  airwater: what are is the webdesign trend of today somebody got some pictures + tutorials ??
16:50  oojacoboo: `g IE9 html5 w3c test
16:50  rivvles: Google says "W3C tests HTML5 browser compatibility, crowns IE9 the champ ..." • http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/02/w3c-tests-html5-browser-compatibility-crowns-ie9-the-champ/ • more results at http://goo.gl/hFCTR
16:50  nvictor: oojacoboo: well does not mean it's the leader
16:51  oojacoboo: nvictor: argue what you will
16:51  nvictor: as far as i'm concerned
16:51  nvictor: i'm under windows xp
16:51  MuKatroNi: hello, if i want to create a div thats 100% width and height with the SWFobject acting as a background, any help please?
16:51  nvictor: and there are still a bunch of us out there
16:51  oojacoboo: and, if you really want to argue it, IE is the leader TODAY
16:51  oojacoboo: by market share
16:51  gkatsev: it is just a small fraction of the tests. Doesn't really mean anything even
16:51  nvictor: we have been completely neglected
16:51  oojacoboo: gkatsev: what??
16:52  oojacoboo: did you read the tests or just spitting shit out your ass?
16:52  gkatsev: the test that w3c ran does not cover all of html5, it is only a small subset of it
16:52  nvictor: gkatsev: i heard it's not fraction of the tests
16:52  nvictor: gkatsev: really?
16:52  gkatsev: yeah
16:53  oojacoboo: http://test.w3.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm
16:53  gkatsev: see the big red box at the top
16:53  MuKatroNi: 		<style type="text/css" media="screen">
16:53  MuKatroNi: 			html, body, #content	{ height:100%; }
16:53  MuKatroNi: 			body					{ margin:0; padding:0; overflow:hidden; }
16:53  MuKatroNi: 			#altContent				{ /* style alt content */ }
16:53  MuKatroNi: 		</style>
16:53  airwater: what are is the webdesign trend of today somebody got some pictures or tutorials??? or blogs sites whateever
16:54  MuKatroNi: is there anything missing?
16:54  MuKatroNi: for my aim
16:54  MuKatroNi: xD
16:54  oojacoboo: gkatsev: I really don't have a comment there... you are just looking to argue
16:54  Phrogz: airwater: We heard you the first time. Your question didn't make any sense to me then, either.
16:54  oojacoboo: MuKatroNi: DO NOT PASTE
16:54  oojacoboo: `paste
16:54  rivvles: Live pastebins: http://www.webdevout.net/test, http://www.jsfiddle.net/, http://pastehtml.com/
16:54 --- ChanServ sets modes [#css +o Phrogz]
16:54  MuKatroNi: oojacoboo, sorry yesterday i pvt someone and told me to paste code so everyone could learn
16:54 <-- Phrogz has kicked MuKatroNi from #css (No pasting multiple lines in the channel.)
16:55  gkatsev: oojacoboo: I am not. I am just pointing out that while IE9 does beat the other browsers in this subset of HTML5, it actually still falls behind in most other sections of it.
16:55  oojacoboo: what other sections?
16:55 --- ChanServ sets modes [#css -o Phrogz]
16:55  gkatsev: html5 is a huge spec.
16:55  oojacoboo: name one or two
16:56  gkatsev: forms, element sections
16:56 * DeRoSvOs thinks that there should be CSS Police, "We should fine Microsoft for IE's poor interpretation of CSS."
16:56  gkatsev: svg
16:57  oojacoboo: what do you mean by *forms?
16:57  oojacoboo: are you talking about form validation?
16:57  gkatsev: input element types and attributes as well as the new form elements
16:57  sriley: although lets be fair ie beat other browsers to css gradients rgba, drop shadows by about 10 years
16:58  gkatsev: lol
16:58  oojacoboo: sriley: as well as @font-face
16:58  sriley: yup
16:59  MuKatroNi: i have to ask a question :D
16:59  oojacoboo: I very much dislike IE, but I'm glad to support their newfound efforts to conform to the W3C spec
16:59  MuKatroNi: with my crappy english
16:59  MuKatroNi: lets see...
16:59  oojacoboo: `ask @ MuKatroNi
16:59  rivvles: MuKatroNi, Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help. Just ask your question or state your problem and wait. Oh, and be sure to read the channel topic.
17:00  MuKatroNi: do you guys think its a good idea to have a SWF video loop in a BG div, having the rest of the site in html + css ?
17:00  gkatsev: no
17:00  MuKatroNi: and why?
17:00  oojacoboo: absolutely not
17:00  oojacoboo: too heavy on system resources
17:01  MuKatroNi: but if the swf is 1mb max?
17:01  MuKatroNi: also?
17:01  oojacoboo: not to mention putting content over flash has always been buggy
17:01  oojacoboo: even with wmode, it flickers, etc
17:01  MuKatroNi: mmm iven if its a pflow only?
17:01  oojacoboo: I don't know what that is, and I don't think it changes anything
17:01  nvictor: riven: i found it! \o/
17:01  MuKatroNi: its a slideshow
17:02  MuKatroNi: but ok i wont do it then
17:02  MuKatroNi: hehe
17:02  nvictor: riven: typophile.com i knew i was getting old
17:02  nvictor: :P
17:02  MuKatroNi: i png wont give problems i guess
17:02  Phrogz: MuKatroNi: Presumably your flash movie is moving. Moving things grab people's attention (it's hardwired into our eyes and visual processing). You will distract from the rest of the site.
17:02  Phrogz: It might be appropriate in a 'site' where the point of the site is an artistic experience, but other than that, no.
17:02  gkatsev: yes, I would avoid any video as background, in general.
17:02  MuKatroNi: phrogz i do motion graphics and i wanted a blury lood with some abstract 3d edits
17:03  gkatsev: MuKatroNi: perhaps do it for select pages but probably not a good idea to do so for the whole website.
17:03  MuKatroNi: loop*
17:03  Phrogz: If "lood" is "load screen" then I give my blessing; distract people all you want while you're making them wait.
17:03  MuKatroNi: ghankstef, this was only for the main site
17:03  Phrogz: Ah :) Then I still would argue against it, but then I don't know what your audience/site purpose is.
17:03  oojacoboo: MuKatroNi: use javascript if you must do this
17:04  MuKatroNi: its tv channels and so on my audience
17:04  oojacoboo: there are tons of great js slideshows avail
17:04  Phrogz: And: I have flash blockers on, so... :)
17:04  gkatsev: you could try html5's video element :P
17:04  MuKatroNi: yes oojacoboo  i was thinking of the swfobject2
17:04  oojacoboo: no
17:04  MuKatroNi: http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/swfobject/testsuite_2_2/test_fullbrowserflash.html i hope i can post this
17:05  oojacoboo: I am not talking about the object loader!
17:05  MuKatroNi: oh!
17:05  MuKatroNi: what then?
17:05  oojacoboo: I am talking about js slideshows
17:05  oojacoboo: `g jquery slideshow @ MuKatroNi
17:05  rivvles: MuKatroNi: Google says "JQuery Cycle Plugin" • http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ • more results at http://goo.gl/8Vp2C
17:05  MuKatroNi: i used pflow already oojacoboo
17:05  oojacoboo: I don't know what the fuck that is dude
17:05  MuKatroNi: haha
17:05  MuKatroNi: the slideshow
17:05  MuKatroNi: jquery
17:06  oojacoboo: good, use it then
17:06  MuKatroNi: code.google
17:06  MuKatroNi: i did it works damn neat
17:06  MuKatroNi: :D
17:07  MuKatroNi: so even if my audience its the tv production studios you dont recomend using a bg video loop
17:07  MuKatroNi: due to bug problems
17:07  MuKatroNi: is that?
17:07  RabSimpson: hi folks, i'm having trouble aligning checkboxes and labels, i've removed all the padding and margins i can find but they just won't move to the left
17:07  RabSimpson: you can see what i mean here: http://mindfulmum.mumdadbabygroup.co.uk/about-us/contact-us/
17:08  RabSimpson: for whatever reason, the boxes are on the left in chrome and not in firefox, and there's a big gap between them in both
17:08  gkatsev: RabSimpson: width is 210px
17:09  RabSimpson: on the boxes?
17:09  gkatsev: yes
17:09  gkatsev: insepct them with firebug/chrome dev tools/safari dev tools/dragonfly
17:09  RabSimpson: where is that? i couldn't find a width set on it? or is it inheriting it from somewhere?
17:09  gkatsev: yeah, inhereting from somewhere
17:10  RabSimpson: i'm an idiot
17:10  RabSimpson: it's a bloody input
17:10  gkatsev: :D
17:10  MuKatroNi: hey seriously, will html5 video element do the trick? not caring about plp getting distracted by the fancy video. (that would be actually good news)
17:10  MuKatroNi: of should i go flash
17:10  gkatsev: MuKatroNi: possibly. Assuming they have html5.
17:11  MuKatroNi: so latest firefox got html 5 right?
17:11  RabSimpson: html5 will be useful for mobile users for whom flash is a problem (that would be 99.9% right now)
17:11  gkatsev: yes. latest firefox and chrome have it. The only problem with that is chrome and ff support different codecs.
17:11  MuKatroNi: i heard mobiles are gonna fix that swf issue some day
17:11  gkatsev: Though, I think they may both support webm now?
17:12  RabSimpson: some day, but it's down to adobe to fix it
17:12  RabSimpson: adobe don't seem very good at coming up with a stable release
17:12  MuKatroNi: man they take time
17:12  riven: gkatsev: yes
17:13  riven: RabSimpson: huh? 10.1 is out
17:14  RabSimpson: a stable release of the mobile runtime
17:14  RabSimpson: not the desktop
17:15  gkatsev: they even got AIR out for android 2.2
17:15  MuKatroNi: ok i think im gonna forget my crazy idea of having a bg fullbrowser in flash
17:15  MuKatroNi: too many problems
17:16  MuKatroNi: even doing versions for mobile and nonflash users
17:16  MuKatroNi: i could get bugs?
17:17  MuKatroNi: what is the best way to add a random bg image?
17:17  RabSimpson: php
17:17  MuKatroNi: php or js?
17:17  DeRoSvOs: Hey guys, this looks great in Chrome... I'd need the SAME display in FF and IE... any suggestions to get all 3 browsers to look like Chrome looks with these styles?  http://pastebin.com/S5GNju13
17:17  MuKatroNi: RabSimpson, any keyword i can search?
17:17  RabSimpson: php random image generator
17:18  MuKatroNi: cool
17:18  RabSimpson: then just call it in your head style
17:18  RabSimpson: it won't work adding it to your css file
17:18  MuKatroNi: yes
17:18  MuKatroNi: its php
17:18  MuKatroNi: !
17:18  MuKatroNi: i learned in this week so much of all this web thing
17:18  MuKatroNi: xD
17:18  RabSimpson: another tip is to add a random number to the call of the file
17:19  MuKatroNi: why is that?
17:19  RabSimpson: ie: random-image.php?48654684684
17:19  MuKatroNi: ok ill keep that in mind
17:19  RabSimpson: it makes sure that it isn't caching the first image you see, meaning that on each page after you don't get the same image over and over
17:19  DeRoSvOs: MuKatroNi:  Maybe a great topic for #php?
17:19  MuKatroNi: sorry
17:20  DeRoSvOs: MuKatroNi:  All good, just, I have a CSS question and it's being pushed up by PHP talk.  lol
17:20 * DeRoSvOs grins.
17:20  MuKatroNi: i go to work now hehe
17:20  MuKatroNi: i leave you all the gurus
17:20  MuKatroNi: :D
17:20 * DeRoSvOs nods, "Hopefully I can get some clarity on this."
17:23  Lindrian: gaaaah
17:23  Lindrian: IE7 sucks so much
17:23  Lindrian: it kills meeeeeee
17:25 * DeRoSvOs nods to Lindrian.
17:25  riven: Lindrian: if only that were true, we wouldn't have to listen to you whine anymore :)
17:25 * DeRoSvOs rofls.
17:27  Lindrian: http://www.webdevout.net/test?01j
17:27  Lindrian: have a look there
17:27  Lindrian: you see how the surrounding text kind of gets bumped down a bit?
17:27  Lindrian: How can I fix that?
17:27  Lindrian: works fine in modern browsers.
17:27  Lindrian: and riven: ha ha.
17:30  Lindrian: anybody know?
17:40  Lindrian: comeon, somebody?

20:10  Bartzy: I have a DIV with a style with ID... I then need to add some styles to this DIV, but only in a certain page... so I want to add a class... but if I set styles in that class that overlap with the styles in the ID, the ID will have precedence.... What should I do ?
20:13  ZombieLoffe: kinesis: remove width: 226px; from the ul
20:13  nicetry_: kinesis: get firebug to tell you?
20:14  Bartzy: I guess what I'm asking is about CSS priority ?
20:14  Bartzy: because ID will be first.. how can I make a class for that element to be before the ID style ?

21:44  Visage: eighty4, `enter :)
21:44  eighty4: *doh*
21:48  tbr: Basically the red divs should look like the green. I know it has to do with the relative vs absolute positioning and collapsing margins (i think) I just don't know how to fix it
21:48  nemo: ZombieLoffe: huh. I just ran into some slightly scary IE behaviour
21:49  nemo: ZombieLoffe: had an iframe that loaded a web font for the body.  sometimes, but not always, if you mouse over the iframe, the parent takes on the font appearance of the iframe
21:49  nemo: gonna work on reduced testcase and such, but this is a bit freaky
21:49  nemo: (IE8)
21:49  nicetry_: tbr: I gave the bright red a padding of 1px and that fixed it
21:50  tbr: but won't that break the box model between browsers?
21:50  tbr: I was trying to avoid padding altogether because of that
21:57  tbr: woah. and i just noticed my header doesn't scroll horizontally
21:57  tbr: guess it needs wrapper in a div as well
22:05  aaroninfidel: anyone know how to do this same effect? http://csswizardry.com/demos/graphs/ but vertical graphs? I've tried to get it working but the animations always fire downwards not upwards.
22:05  jerome187: does anyone know why there is always a little bit of a scrolling here?  shouldn't be any. http://ghnexussix.dynamicwebcasting.net/index.html

22:12  alberto2000: anyone knows best practice to get rid of the shift that occurs when a scrollbar is showed/hidden?
22:12  Bar__: Is it worth using in production websites ?
22:12  nicetry_: Bar__: I've been researching the same thing
22:12  EvanDonovan: alaing_away: thanks. am downloading now.
22:13  Bar__: nicetry_: Great :) What did you find so far if I may ask ?
22:13  jerome187: css3pie will die with ajax and refreshing parts of the page
22:13  alaing_away: EvanDonovan: not a problem its excellant I use it to open ie6,7,8 all in there own tabs
22:13  nicetry_: He's very honest, and code looks great, but I still haven't found anything with it in production
22:13  Bar__: jerome187: Why do you think AJAX will die ?

22:13  jerome187: ya ie7
22:14  jerome187: no... it was pretty lame
22:14  jerome187: and ie8
22:15  nicetry_: trusting you that ajax and css3pie is dead doesn't really get us any closer to a good solution now.
22:16  jerome187: sry :(
22:18  nicetry_: and if not css3+css3pie, what? css sprites? js? some other silly hack?
22:18  CuDi: anyone know what font this is : http://new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/Img?maskmode=transparent&hborder=0&vborder=0&maxheight=0&maxwidth=0&majorid=000013dd4cdaca2d0001140100001d05&frs_server=node4.ric.mf&minorid=1+3+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13
22:18  jerome187: i don't even know what css sprites are
22:18  jerome187: do they work in ie6,7,8
22:19  eighty4: jerome187: yes
22:19  nicetry_: jerome187: touche
22:19  alaing_away: hi i'm using white-space:nowrap on my td/th and in IE the content seems to extend out of the td and it takes the border with it. IN ff 3.5 it simply over laps the text with the adjacent cell. HOw do I get the col to stay all one width
22:19  alaing_away: IE7 that is
22:20  jerome187: I hope ie9 makes all the other ie's die
22:20  nicetry_: it won't
22:20  jerome187: that should be a feature of it... somehow...
22:21  nicetry_: Bar__: what else have you looked at?
22:21  Bar__: nicetry_: Only really saw CSS3PIE, it looks great.
22:21  Bar__: the question is about performance and stability...
22:22  Bar__: if performance is a non-issue and there are no weird crashes (or I can check in IE6/7/8 in my computer and if it runs fine then it's fine anywhere).. that's great..
22:22  Bar__: Anyone tested that ?
22:22  nicetry_: its pretty new, but he has a good ticket system on googlecode. and I think proformance will be way up from any js you find, though I have to test it.  Whats got me worried is: http://css3pie.com/documentation/known-issues/
22:23  jerome187: ajax makes it die.  if you try to update part of the page that is using css3pie, or a child element of what your updating is
22:23  jerome187: seems like its something that could be fixed though
22:24  alaing_away: Bar_ what is css3pie?
22:24  nicetry_: alaing_away: http://css3pie.com/
22:25  Bar__: nicetry_, but if everything works with css3pie in my/your website.. it's fine right ?
22:25  Bar__: nicetry_: It won't break "just like that" in other IE installations ...
22:28  nicetry_: Bar__: I think its only going to get better, theoretically you could only feed the reference to the behavoir file to the versions of IE that you want
22:28  alaing_away: hi i'm using white-space:nowrap on my td/th and in IE the content seems to extend out of the td and it takes the border with it. IN ff 3.5 it simply over laps the text with the adjacent cell. HOw do I get the col to stay all one width
22:28  alaing_away: IE7 that is
22:29  nicetry_: not 100% on that though
22:32  EvanDonovan: ok, i fixed my css issue - i just had to have an ie7.css that overrode my regular styles and floated the logo left, and the newsletter signup none, but with padding to give it space
22:33  EvanDonovan: it's not as reliable but it works ok
22:33  EvanDonovan: this was basing off the code on my live site www.allgirlsallowed.org. the test site's code was just horribly broken, by what i tried to do to fix it.
22:33  nicetry_: Bar__: have you run his demo in your IE-testing browsers http://css3pie.com/demos/tabs/ ?
22:33  Bar__: nicetry_: Yes, it works nicely.. in yours it doesn't ?
22:34  nicetry_: yeah
22:34  Bar__: it's so cool
22:35  Bar__: how come Microsoft didn't implement this solution... so ignorant
22:36  nicetry_: Bar__: they say because its not 'standardized yet' which turns out to be a very witty joke, seeing as they've never followed an honest standard in their life
22:37  Bar__: heh
22:38  zack88: do you know a good free host to upload my css and js?  the  that i know is googlecode (that i use both for js and css), but it doesn't provide cachable resources...
22:38  zack88: best*
22:42  jaypur: hi, some text of mine is to align right but it has a space between it, can someone help me?
22:43  jaypur: http://purisco.com/expo/  click on +expositores
22:43  jaypur: plz
22:45  ZombieLoffe: jaypur, that's because of the default margin and padding on <ul>. Set ul, li { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
22:46  jaypur: ZombieLoffe, i have here
22:46  jaypur: .ezposi li  { }
22:46  jaypur: i put there???
22:47  jaypur: margin: 0px; padding: 0px;
22:47  jaypur: ?
22:47  jaypur: i did that nothing happened
22:47  ZombieLoffe: jaypur, on the <ul> AND <lI>
22:47  jimi_: How can I apply a height to an iframe? i tried using the height: attribute in the css but it didn't seem to affect it.
22:47 --- dev2_ is now known as dev2
22:48  jaypur: refresh it plz, ZombieLoffe  and see .expozi
22:48  jaypur: plz
22:49  ZombieLoffe: jaypur, you still haven't set margin and padding to 0 :P
22:50  jaypur: ZombieLoffe, .expozi ul {
22:50  jaypur: margin: 0px;
22:50  jaypur: padding:0px;
22:50  jaypur: }
22:50  jaypur:  isn't it right???
22:50  jaypur: how could i do it??
22:51  jaypur: now i done
22:51  jaypur: ul, li { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
22:51  ZombieLoffe: Um. Yeah, that'd be a good idea.
22:51  ZombieLoffe: To select an ul with class="expozi" you would do ul.expozi or just expozi
22:51  ZombieLoffe: er
22:51  ZombieLoffe: .expozi*
22:51  jaypur: thanks ZombieLoffe
22:53  cardona507: scss wtf?
22:53  jaypur: ZombieLoffe, thanks man see ya
22:54  ZombieLoffe: cardona507, sass
22:54  cardona507: scss is sass3
22:54  cardona507: i don't like the added verbosness
22:54  cardona507: i was just growing to luv sass
22:54  ZombieLoffe: I never bothered with it
22:55  amagee: hey a while ago someone showed me a link that showed how to make padding not affect the overall size of an element ((the padding eats into the size of the element rather than expanding it).. does anyone have any idea what that's called?
22:55  cardona507: have you ever checked it out? I totally didn't like it for the first couple of months that I worked with it. But then recently I built a site with straight CSS and it was clear to me how good sass is
22:56  oksushi: amagee: box-sizing
22:56  amagee: ah thanks oksushi, that's the one :)
22:57  amagee: that's css3 only?
23:00  kenthree: is img inside <a> valid?
23:01  oksushi: did the validator complain when you tried it?
23:01  kenthree: haven't tried
23:02  ZombieLoffe: heh
23:02  ZombieLoffe: oksushi is hinting that you should Try It And See(tm)
23:02  ZombieLoffe: but yes, it's valid
23:02  kenthree: i know "block" elements are no but not sure what img is
23:02  ZombieLoffe: img is a funky sort of inline that accepts width or height.
23:02  ZombieLoffe: and, even. Dunno where that or came from.
23:13  Neillithan: does anyone remember or know what that mozilla css property is that lets you chop up an image into several pieces and render the entire page from 1 image
23:13  Neillithan: kinda like background position, but not.
