00:00  oksushi|na: PLATO: change width to max-width
00:00  harmaz: oksushi|na: yeah, that worked - awesome
00:01  oksushi|na: soreau: 'centered horizontally and left aligned' means what?
00:01  soreau: oksushi|na: I mean I want the list centered but the text to all start at the same place on the left of the list..
00:01  PLATO: can you make a smaller div centered in the list?
00:02  PLATO: and put your list, left-justified, in that internal div?
00:02  oksushi|na: soreau: then center the <ul>
00:02  soreau: as opposed to only centered, where the text would not be left aligned (because the list members are of different lengths)
00:02  PLATO: you would need to know the maximum width of the list items
00:02  temhawk: soreau: didn't you ask this earlier already?
00:02  soreau: temhawk: I'm not sure
00:02  PLATO: oksushi: can you independently align the <ul> and the <li>'s?
00:03  soreau: temhawk: The jsfiddle is behaving differently from my file on disk
00:03  temhawk: [01:33:03 AM] soreau: Is there a way to do a left-aligned list but have it centered?
00:03  temhawk: [01:35:08 AM] temhawk: soreau: if you want a block level element centered, give it a width and use auto margin on the sides
00:04  soreau: temhawk: Yes, it works in the file on disk but not the same way in the jsfiddle
00:04  temhawk: soreau: can you give me the link, please?

00:10  soreau: temhawk: Yea I played with all of those settings and couldn't figure out how to make it do what I wanted
00:11  temhawk: soreau: you need to specify a unit, such as pixels (px) or ems (em)
00:11  soreau: ok
00:12 --- Channel #css was synced in 123 seconds
00:14  soreau: temhawk: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/1/
00:14  harmaz: CSS noob, google hasn't told me how to do this: http://pastie.org/1465143
00:15  soreau: temhawk: I want the box to be centered and the text to be centered in the box but the start of each word I want to be the same position (left aligned)
00:15  temhawk: soreau: now, margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; :)
00:17  soreau: temhawk: Now how do I add a margin between the text and the (inner) box?
00:17  temhawk: soreau: ul { padding: 10px; }
00:18  temhawk: soreau: or if by "text" you mean "Paragraph1", use ul { margin: 10px; }
00:19  temhawk: soreau: you should also get rid of all them "style" attributes in your HTML, and try to avoid <br>'s
00:20  soreau: temhawk: What should I use instead?
00:20  soreau: I'm still trying to figure out how to validate this code too
00:20  soreau: because it's css3, it doesn't validate
00:20  temhawk: soreau: margin, padding, positioning, whatever
00:21  soreau: temhawk: Oh ok
00:21  temhawk: soreau: if the only errors you get are from CSS 3, it's fine. (just know that CSS 3 isn't as widely supported, of course)
00:22  soreau: temhawk: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/1/
00:22  soreau: This is what I have now but I'm not clear on how to get rid of the <br />'s
00:23  temhawk: soreau: just get rid of them, see what happens, and then adjust the margin/etc of your elements to make it look nice again
00:24  soreau: temhawk: I will try
00:25  takeout: hey, im having trying to float an image along side an h1 with a bottom border.  the text wraps fine, but the border runs underneath the image.  i've tried changing the display of the h1, but cant seem to get what i want.
00:25  oksushi|na: takeout: url to the page?
00:26  soreau: temhawk: padding settings are having no effect http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/3/
00:27  oksushi|na: soreau: use margin to separate elements, not <br>
00:28  soreau: oksushi|na: I was trying to use padding
00:28  oksushi|na: why?
00:28  oksushi|na: use margin
00:28  oksushi|na: soreau: also, you have this: margin: 50;
00:28  oksushi|na: 50 NEEDS a unit of measurement
00:29  soreau: ah I keep forgetting that
00:30  oksushi|na: takeout: this is not a proper html document
00:30  oksushi|na: you are lacking a doctype, for one
00:30  oksushi|na: and a <html> element, <head> element, etc etc
00:30  Tempus2: Did it strike you it might be part of a document oksushi|na? :P
00:31  oksushi|na: hmm?
00:31  takeout: huh?  i am seeing doctype html head..
00:31  takeout: hmm..
00:32  oksushi|na: takeout: https://skitch.com/calwilson/rj12f/skitch
00:32  takeout: oh opps
00:32  takeout: ok, one more try sushi  =]
00:33  oksushi|na: validate!
00:33  soreau: How can I make a margin around a box (not the text inside)
00:33  oksushi|na: takeout: http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/check?ucn_uri=http://takeout.no-ip.org/halotechnics/contact/&ucn_task=conformance
00:33  oksushi|na: soreau: use margin
00:34  oksushi|na: padding is inside the box, margin outside
00:35  temhawk: soreau: if you think something is not working it could be that two adjacent margins are collapsing into each other (bigger one wins).
00:38  soreau: I am not getting it to work
00:39  soreau: can I have margin-left: auto; margin-top: 40; ?
00:39  soreau: ugh, px
00:39  soreau: ok it works
00:39  temhawk: soreau: yeah, you can do any of these variants: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin
00:41  soreau: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/6/
00:41  soreau: thanks for your help temhawk and oksushi|na
00:41  temhawk: no problem ;)
00:42  soreau: Now why are there no bullets on that ul?
00:43  temhawk: soreau: set a list-style-type, not sure why it's not there automatically though
00:44  soreau: temhawk: It is in the page loaded from disk just not in jsfiddle
00:44  soreau: I know jsfiddle adds some styling things
00:44  soreau: temhawk: Where can I find the list style types?
00:44  soreau: ah found it
00:45  PLATO: oksushi: max-width fixed my problem ty
00:47  soreau: cool it works
00:49  soreau: It doesn't seem to respect the font-size here, what's the deal?
00:49  soreau: http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/7/
00:50  LachlanH: I'm trying to use a semi-transparent div, which works fine, but firefox 2 doesn't seem to support it. Is there any way around this?
00:51  temhawk: LachlanH: -moz-opacity or something like that i think
00:53  LachlanH: temhawk: I'm using 5 attributes. opacity, filter, -ms-filter, -khtml-opacity and -moz-opacity
00:54  soreau: It respects font-size when using the same code in a file loaded from disk but not in jsfiddle
01:00  temhawk: LachlanH: you using a decimal number for opacity and -moz-opacity right?
01:01  temhawk: LachlanH: 1 = fully opaque, 0.5 = half transparent
01:01  LachlanH: I figured it out
01:01  LachlanH: The transparent div has a z-index of -1
01:01  temhawk: oh ok
01:01  LachlanH: Firefox 2 won't display it properly for some reason
01:02  temhawk: probably because z-index makes it go behind the page or some element?
01:02  LachlanH: yes it's supposed to. other browsers display it properly
01:02  LachlanH: as does firefox 3
01:12  soreau: Seems <p style="blah:blah"> works but not p.a{blah:blah;} <p class="a">
01:13  oksushi|na: soreau: umm, that is not a valid selector
01:13  oksushi|na: you want p.blah {} if the html is <p class="blah">
01:15  temhawk: oksushi|na: what you wrote is the same what soreau wrote
01:16  soreau: yea that is confusing me
01:16  oksushi|na: soreau: did you validate?
01:16  soreau: no
01:17  temhawk: soreau: give us the link to your jsfiddle again please
01:17  oksushi|na: then do that, you could have made a typo
01:17  temhawk: also, why don't you try on some other site like webdevout to see if it's the same there?
01:19  soreau: temhawk: Hm, it seems to work on jsfiddle
01:19  temhawk: soreau: are you not using units again, btw?
01:22 * temhawk places a bet that his suspicion is right.
01:22  mdpatrick: Weird question. I'm using anki, a spaced repetition program, to kind of bash into my head useful stuff. So far I've made a nice deck of various linux commandline stuff, and I'm looking to add to my "CSS" deck.
01:22  mdpatrick: Anything you guys would suggest for flash cards? Something you use repeatedly, or perhaps a site or cheat sheet I can pull from for multiple?
01:23  soreau: ok it works now
01:23  soreau: temhawk: It was because I had a stray 'margin: auto'
01:23  mdpatrick: One I just made, for example, was all of the serifed fonts so instead of just defining font-family with "times new roman" I can do it the *right* way, which is to give all of the options
01:23  temhawk: soreau: ok :p
01:24  temhawk: mdpatrick: well i have a short list of fonts that i consider to be "web-safe"
01:25  temhawk: mdpatrick: http://pastebin.com/D6eeeMvp
01:26  mdpatrick: temhawk: Neat... to use these do you put them in quotes when defining them with font-family
01:26  mdpatrick: ?
01:26  mdpatrick: declaring, rather
01:26  temhawk: i also have many bookmarks for useful tips but my bookmarks are totally unorganized and i am too lazy to sort it out now XD
01:27  temhawk: mdpatrick: if the font name has spaces in it you have to enclose it in quotes, otherwise you don't have to
01:30  mdpatrick: temhawk: Cool... I'm going to make a flash card of this list. Thanks. :)
01:30  temhawk: np :)
01:31  piklu: provide me some great tutorials to follow for css and html
01:31  temhawk: mdpatrick: actually, i am going to see if i can pull up anything useful for you from my bookmarks
01:31  temhawk: ]schools @ piklu
01:31  _ZofBot4: piklu, Explore the intricacies of HTML and CSS here: http://wsc.opera.com/ , www.htmlhelp.com/ , http://css-discuss.incutio.com/ , www.brainjar.com/ , www.htmldog.com/ , http://css.maxdesign.com.au/
01:36  temhawk: mdpatrick: meh, most of the stuff i have are longer articles. nothing you can really put on a flash card
01:36  mdpatrick: Some of the stuff int he presentations on maxdesign can be boiled down
01:36  mdpatrick: like properties that are inherited
01:41  temhawk: mdpatrick: here's another: CSS escape sequence: \00000A (the hexadecimal digits represent a Unicode character). leading zeros can be omitted for shorthandness — http://www.merttol.com/articles/css/introduction-to-css-escape-sequences.html
01:47  temhawk: mdpatrick: and maybe this'll fit on your flash cards as well: http://pastebin.com/x6Ht01zH Float Containment
01:55  mdpatrick: temhawk: What is this? float containment?
01:55  temhawk: mdpatrick: when you float an element to the left or right, by default its container will ignore the height of the floated element when determining its own height
01:56  temhawk: mdpatrick: float containment makes the parent aware of the float in that regard
01:56  temhawk: applies to width as well
01:59  temhawk: mdpatrick: and some useful links: http://css-tricks.com/ , http://pxtoem.com/ , http://www.quirksmode.org/ , http://24ways.org/ , http://www.alistapart.com/ , http://pragprog.com/ (books)
02:00  temhawk: i'm shamefully forgetting a lot of others, though :/
02:01  mdpatrick: ahhhhh yes, I've had issues with float containment
02:01  temhawk: this is also a good site: http://webdesignledger.com/
02:01  mdpatrick: had to add div with clear on it
02:02  temhawk: yup, but overflow: auto; is better, and if you can't use that, you can do the other method with the :after pseudo-selector
02:03  qq99: any recommendations for IE testing in unix aside from vm? wine perhaps?
02:03  temhawk: it's the same thing as a clear div, without the bad markup
02:03  temhawk: qq99: yeah, i use Wine and standalone IE executables
02:04  qq99: temhawk, do I need to worry about font renderings and such with that?
02:04  qq99: temhawk, or can I assume wine will produce it exactly as native windows would?
02:04  qq99: I suppose for the most part it won't be a big issue
02:04  qq99: temhawk, also, where you get your standalone exes?
02:05  temhawk: qq99: i think it will look just like on a real Windows box. at least, for me it looks just as ugly as on Windows xD
02:05  qq99: temhawk, lol, yeah, decided to change to ubuntu for dev now, noticed the fonts are so  much more beautiful everywhere I go

02:17  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: You're better off giving a test case using the URL in the topic, it's too difficult to figure out from just looking at code in pastebin.
02:17  WhiteAvenger: that's what I was going to do MauriceJ :)
02:18  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: Ah okay, sorry mate.
02:18  WhiteAvenger: http://www.webdevout.net/test?019
02:18  WhiteAvenger: np
02:22  legostud: is the content in the left a single line of text?  if so use white-space:nowrap and set the right column width to something like 90%.
02:23  temhawk: legostud: that seems like an ugly solution
02:23  MauriceJ: I thought white-space:nowrap; was a hack?  Has something changed?
02:25  legostud: not sure
02:25  WhiteAvenger: it doesn't seem like the most elegant solution tbh
02:27  legostud: maybe MauriceJ can think of something better, but I've found tables to be tricky to format.
02:28  MauriceJ: Hrm, I haven't done tables in a long time for obvious reasons but I thought that text would automatically size the cells.
02:28  MauriceJ: BRB
02:40  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: This is actually taking me more time than I thought.  I've not figured it out quite yet.
02:40  WhiteAvenger: ok :)
02:40  WhiteAvenger: I've worked around it by re-arranging my columns
02:40  WhiteAvenger: so it's not important
02:41  WhiteAvenger: dw about it if you don't want to spend the time ;)
02:44  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: Yes it's doing my nut in :D
02:45  MauriceJ: I am baffled, I was about to suggest that legostud's solution just might be it even though it's not proper.
02:46  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: This page has tables on it as well with text that seems to be bounded by the columns so I'm still baffled, a bit: http://badhtml.comeze.com/
02:46  WhiteAvenger: which tables, for example?
02:49  MauriceJ: WhiteAvenger: I had the Instruments of Torture table in mind.
02:50  WhiteAvenger: but that's filling the whole width
02:50  WhiteAvenger: there's no real white space
02:51  legostud: if you delete a few of the columns the problem shows up
02:51  WhiteAvenger: it's just spreading the whole table evenly, adjusting for columns that are too wide
02:51  WhiteAvenger: exactly legostud
02:54  MauriceJ: Yeah, I'm stumped.  I reckon legostud's solution is what will work here.  Thank god riven isn't here to scalp me.
02:57  WhiteAvenger: lol

12:31  koskoz: hi
12:31  koskoz: is this possible that a link inside a td takes all the cell size
12:32 --- Channel #css was synced in 117 seconds
12:32  dumont: in html5 i think
12:33  dumont: <td href="">
12:33  dumont: but you could still try
12:33  oksushi: no…
12:33  MauriceJ: koskoz: make the anchor display:block;
12:33  koskoz: MauriceJ: I did but that's not working
12:33  koskoz: here's the link : http://www.webdevout.net/test?08
12:33 * MauriceJ clicks
12:34  oksushi: koskoz: that is not a table
12:34  koskoz: oksushi: what ?
12:34  oksushi: if that is 'navigation', you should mark it up as a list
12:34  ZombieLoffe: koskoz: height: 100%; on the <a> and it will. You also have some padding on the td, pushing the a inwards.
12:35  koskoz: oksushi: no, it's the only way to do something like this working with ie6
12:35  oksushi: the #main_menu is a giveaway
12:35  oksushi: koskoz: horseshit
12:35  MauriceJ: koskoz: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
12:35  ZombieLoffe: He wants justified dynamic number of items...
12:35  koskoz: tell me how is it possible to have a variable number of li, a variable width of li, all of this on the same line with text return
12:35  koskoz: tell me, I'm so curious
12:37  koskoz: ZombieLoffe: height: 100% makes my link vertically aligned to the top
12:37  dumont: :)
12:37  koskoz: I've already tried that
12:37  ZombieLoffe: koskoz: So increase line-height
12:37  koskoz: ZombieLoffe: as you can see there are multplie line on one cell
12:37  koskoz: just try to increase line-height and you will understand
12:37  ZombieLoffe: ah.. actually, on my screen there isn't, but yeah
12:38  koskoz: oh, more than 1920 ?
12:38  oksushi: koskoz: so you would rather have shitty HTML to achieve some layout effect?
12:38  ZombieLoffe: nope, 1680
12:38 * oksushi wonders at some peoples priorities
12:38  koskoz: oksushi: ask that to my client
12:38  koskoz: customer
12:39  koskoz: ZombieLoffe: true, I have all the text on one line too
12:39  doberman: table for menu = unbeliveable
12:39  koskoz: you are so funny guys
12:39  koskoz: do the same render for ie6
12:39  koskoz: go for it
12:39  koskoz: i watch
12:39  koskoz: and then i'll laugh
12:40  koskoz: we use lists for menu ? No sh**
12:40  doberman: koskoz: i would rather use "if ie6 ( do some js )" or put modal popup with message "download a browser" than put table for menu
12:40  doberman: just because of ie6, wtf
12:40  koskoz: doberman: what a nice solution
12:41  koskoz: you work with perfect customers I guess
12:41  doberman: no, i just ask for 20% plus for ie6 support and nobody accepts
12:41  doberman: and we all are happy
12:41  oksushi: heh
12:42  koskoz: oh, and to achieve the same render without using a table I have to use display: table-cell and it's not compatible with IE7 neither
12:42  koskoz: so, still no solution for my links to take all the height of the td I guess ?
12:43  dumont: someone want to explain to me why the header_expand div, the green top div height is longer than the neighboring yellow? both css have the same number http://www.webdevout.net/test?0q
12:43  doberman: koskoz: height/line-height for the a-element
12:43  koskoz: doberman: I should have fixed the width of the table in this example, because in fact it's 1000px
12:43  koskoz: doberman: so some text is returning to a new line, and I can't use line-height here
12:45  doberman: koskoz: http://www.webdevout.net/test?0r
12:45  doberman: is that what you are looking for ?
12:45  dumont: lol yes
12:46  dumont: doberman can you look at mine?
12:46  complete: Hey People! Why doesnt opacity work like this:
12:46  complete: <div style="background-color: red;">abc<span style="background-color: rgba(255,255,0,128)">def</span></div>
12:46  complete: shouldnt the span be opaque 50%?
12:47  complete: but its completely yellow.
12:47  doberman: complete: http://webdevout.net/test
12:47  ZombieLoffe: complete: alpha is from 0-1, not 0-255
12:47  dumont: :)
12:47  ZombieLoffe: complete: Eg. you want 255, 255, 0, 0.5
12:47  complete: ah!
12:47  complete: great! thanks!
12:48  dumont: someone want to explain to me why the header_expand div, the green top div height is longer than the neighboring yellow? both css have the same height number http://www.webdevout.net/test?0q
12:48  dumont: also, why is the red top div not all the way at the top?
12:48  MauriceJ: dumont: Your page looks like a mondrian painting.
12:48  dumont: Maurice :P
12:48  doberman: lol
12:48  doberman: honestly i can't understand the mess, dumont
12:48  dumont: it's supposed to be a letter C of different colors
12:48  MauriceJ: doberman: It's a Mondrian painting.
12:49  koskoz: doberman: no, add a "width: 1000px" on the table and look at the result
12:49  ZombieLoffe: dumont: what on earth have you done...
12:50  dumont: its called CSS have you heard of it?
12:50  MauriceJ: *sigh* It's a Mondrian painting, damn it!
12:50  dumont: MUAHHAhahahaa
12:50  dumont: :P
12:50  dumont: let me explain, i separated the page into header body and footer
12:50  ZombieLoffe: dumont, it's called terrible, confusing, obfuscated css, but yes.
12:50  dumont: header contains left right and expander
12:50  ZombieLoffe: dumont, the "extended" green thing is actually #footer
12:50  dumont: ohh wait yes it is
12:51  dumont: rofl
12:51  dumont: idiot
12:51  doberman: dumont: there's a lot easier way to do the same, starting with 3 floating divs in the header
12:51  dumont: i knew using the same colors was gonna bite me in the ass
12:51  ZombieLoffe: you'll probably want clear: both; on #footer
12:51  ZombieLoffe: Oh, and a general rule about floating: any floating element will drop below a non-floated element if it does not precede it. That's why #footer_right ends up on the next line, below #footer_expand.
12:52  eighty4: dumont: why are you doing background-repeat:no-repeat; when you don't use a background image?
12:52  dumont: doberman but this same thing worked just some time ago before I rewrote it, i t had the exact same layout for header
12:52  dumont: eighty4 because this is a test.. and there are no images
12:52  dumont: while on my end there are
12:53  dumont: ZombieLoffe so I need to place footer_right before expand div
12:54  ZombieLoffe: When using floated in conjunction with non-floated elements, yes
12:54  dumont: thanks
12:54  dumont: now i just need to get the footer into its place
12:54  dumont: why did you say I needed to clear:both?
12:55  ZombieLoffe: clear essentially means that no floated elements are allowed next to the element with clear -- eg. it will drop below any floated elements preceeding it
12:56  dumont: how come I don't have to do the same to body?
12:56  dumont: cuz body isn't floating? even though divs inside body are floating?
12:56  ZombieLoffe: because body contains everything. No floated elements precede it.
12:56  dumont: ZombieLoffe header which contains floating elements preceed it
12:56  ZombieLoffe: oh, thought you meant <body>.
12:57  dumont: #body
12:57  ZombieLoffe: because #body just contains floated children, and floated children will respect other floated elements' boundaries
12:58  dumont: hmm, don't understand why i needed to clear between footer and body, but not between body and header

13:02  eighty4: Morning Mark_Morcom
13:03  dumont: ZombieLoffe don't see the difference between the relationship of header<>body and body<>footer, all use floating elements
13:03  Mark_Morcom: Is there a sticky footer method that works with IE7 or even better IE6
13:04 --- blackice2999 is now known as blackice2999|afk
13:05  ZombieLoffe: Mark_Morcom: www.cssstickyfooter.com
13:06  Mark_Morcom: "This sticky footer solution is working in all major browsers, including Google Chrome and IE 8!"
13:06  Mark_Morcom: It only says IE8
13:06  dumont: "To style the footer, we first need to set it to "clear: both". This is critical, as it will force the footer below any floated elements above."
13:06  dumont: why then isn't this necessary for body? since there are floating elements above body, they are in the header
13:07  ZombieLoffe: dumont: because #body doesn't fit on that line.
13:07  ZombieLoffe: or rather, #body's children don't.
13:08  Mark_Morcom: Funny, its says IE8 but seems to work in IE6
13:08  dumont: so ideally i want to clear body too?
13:08  ZombieLoffe: No one cares about IE6 these days, Mark_Morcom. In the "full list" you can see it works for IE 4.0, 5.5, 6.0.. etc
13:08  dumont: and I guess the reason that green rectangle fell upwards aside from not having clear, is also because the #content did not expand all the way?
13:08  ZombieLoffe: dumont: probably, yes.
13:09  dumont: why didn't #content expand all the way?
13:09  ZombieLoffe: cause it's floated.
13:09  Mark_Morcom: ZombieLoffe: I live in Africa, people still run Win95 in some places :P
13:09  ZombieLoffe: heh.

13:23  Bear_N6REJ: ZombieLoffe: well, thats what i thought but .dynamic-tab-pane-control .tab-row .tab hover{ does not work

13:24  russinkungen: ah, but tab:hover {} and override the selected with .selected:hover

13:27  russinkungen: Bear_N6REJ: http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/
13:27  ZombieLoffe: .helloworld {} is a class selector, it selects <el class="helloworld">. :hover is a pseudo-class, because it doesn't select any actual class, it selects anything that's currently hovered
13:27  Mark_Morcom_: On that sticky footer, there is this comment: must declare 0 margins on everything, also for main layout components use padding, not vertical margins (top and bottom) to add spacing, else those margins get added to total height and your footer gets pushed down a bit more, creating vertical scroll bars in the browser.
13:27  Mark_Morcom_: Im not sure what they are asking me to do, because I have ran into that problem
13:27  russinkungen: Bear_N6REJ: you can try that one aswell. I'm guessing it's easier than the w3c definition.
13:28  Mark_Morcom_: I have auto left and right margin only
13:28  ZombieLoffe: Mark_Morcom: You need to reset all default margins to 0
13:28  ZombieLoffe: At least the ones on layout elements and html, body
13:29  Bear_N6REJ: ZombieLoffe: so when I'm seeing h2 class="foo" i'm actually seeing <div class="foo"> <h2> ?

14:33  jani84h: perhaps

14:38  jani84h: sure, makes sense to set it first though
14:40  jani84h: i also quote "browers have better support for colors based on hex than on name".
14:40  ZombieLoffe: That is quite dubious
14:41  Dartfall: They are trying to sabotage us, newbies!
14:41  ZombieLoffe: IE6 and forward at least support the most common colour names, hence suggesting changing "white" to "#fff" makes no sense

15:20  Ziggy`: I'm getting issues whereas the div fits fine on the page when printing, but whereas one image goes on the next page, rather than just the whole div being print.
15:20  Ziggy`: On the next page that is.

15:21  Ziggy`: I'm using that on the div, but it's not applying for images inside the div.
15:21  daviddoria: ah great, that second link will probably prevent these stupid questions
15:21  daviddoria: thanks
15:22  daviddoria:  however, it gives me this error: "Property -moz-border-radius ", but that is in fact a valid Firefox element
15:22  Ziggy`: Should I use page-break-inside:avoid; ?
15:24  ZombieLoffe: sounds like you want page-break-before: always; ..
15:25  Ziggy`: nsj
15:25  Ziggy`: nah
15:25  Ziggy`: I don't want that.
15:25  Ziggy`: I just want to do a page-break if all the contents inside don't fit
15:26  Ziggy`: if they do fit, then I don't want it to do a page-break, but it seems IE and Firefox default to doing page-break on images inside a div when they don't fit on the rest of the page.

16:24  MauriceJ: saba: Here is what you need to know http://badhtml.comeze.com/
16:28  KenBW2: I'm pondering two ways of creating generic styles to be used everywhere, and possibly shared across sites. The two ways involve how the styles are applied to the elements. Which would be the best way:
16:28  KenBW2: http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=35339 vs http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=35340
16:30  daviddoria: Is the class name an inherited property? That is, if I do <table class="myclass"> <tr><th> , will that th get affected by a th.myclass definition in the css?
16:31  KenBW2: daviddoria: you see all the relevant CSS/HTML there
16:31  KenBW2: daviddoria: there's no additional inheritance
16:31  saba: MauriceJ: I don't really buy their arguments, I think it's a matter of coding style
16:32  KenBW2: daviddoria: sorry, thought that was @me
16:32  daviddoria: KenBW2 - I guess I'm saying is there a difference between defining "th.myclass" and ".myclass th" ?
16:32  MauriceJ: saba: Suit yourself, saba.  You're wrong about it being a 'matter of coding style'.
16:33  KenBW2: daviddoria: in terms of inheritance, no difference. But it might change how much priority your rules have
16:33  saba: MauriceJ: so you think it's a matter of bandwidth saving etc?
16:33  saba: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html
16:33  saba: it's an interesting discussion
16:33  MauriceJ: saba: It's a matter of several things, that is only a part of it.  It's also a matter of correctly coding things and not using HTML for presentational code.
16:34  MauriceJ: saba: I don't see an effort on your part to understand that HTML is not to be used presentationally.
16:34  daviddoria: interesting - it doesn't seem to work unless I use the .myclass th, so maybe something else is killing it since the priority is different?
16:36  KenBW2: daviddoria: paste code

16:37  Lazylegs: surprisingly there is big difference between th.myclass and .myclass th
16:37  Lazylegs: Two totally different selectors
16:38  KenBW2: Lazylegs: daviddoria is talking about changing the HTML too, so the second would have the class on the table, whereas it'd be on the th in the first
16:39  daviddoria: Right, if I put the class on the th element in the html it would work
16:39  daviddoria: but LazyLegs, those links helped - I see now how the specificity is increased by specifying a more specific selector

16:41  saba: MauriceJ: I haven't written any table layout myself for production use, however I think I haven't seen any real arguments not to use table layouts. There are many rumours like SEO problems, readability, copy and paste problems etc.
16:41  MauriceJ: saba: There are no 'rumours'.
16:42  saba: MauriceJ: so what are the SEO problems for example?
16:42  MauriceJ: saba: AGain I don't see an effort on your part to learn and understand anything about tables and HTML.
16:42  KenBW2: saba: ill acknowledge that those are to some extent intangible benefits, especially the SEO one
16:42  KenBW2: saba: but CSS is much more maintainable
16:42  MauriceJ: saba: Let's go and talk instead, since you say you make pages, about accesibility.
16:42  saba: MauriceJ: well, I ask for real arguments about it
16:42  Lazylegs: about why tables are bad for layouts: http://phrogz.net/css/WhyTablesAreBadForLayout.html
16:43  MauriceJ: saba: People who are blind or what have you can't properly access the pages done in table format with special programmes that tell them what's there.
16:43  MauriceJ: saba: There are tonnes of reasons and you're just not listening.  I really can't be bothered to answer your questions becxause you already won't accept seriously valid information about it.  Just keep on doing what you're doing in complete ignorance.  I don't have time for pepole like you. Sorry.
16:44  saba: MauriceJ: and you have checked that for real?
16:44  saba: no, I'm not the guy doing table layouts and argumenting that's the best way.
16:44  saba: I have as said not done table layouts, but I'm interesting why it's bad and I have not seen real facts. The sites you have linked are interesting however.
16:45  KenBW2: saba == troll?
16:46  saba: KenBW2: well, that's really mature ain't it.
16:46  KenBW2: saba: come on, coming to the CSS IRC to argue that CSS is pointless when there's gigabytes of debate on the topic online. That's not trolling?
16:47  saba: KenBW2: I'm not argumenting that CSS is pointless. I'm working with CSS and think it's great, althought the language itself has some misbenefiths as a language. CSS3 are fixing a lot of that.
16:48  KenBW2: saba: so your point is what exactly
16:48  saba: KenBW2: why I ask in this channel is that I want to hear someone say that they have tried table layouts, finding it's not working and not that they only have read things on the web
16:48  saba: I'm looking for arguments and personal experience that table layouts are bad, sure they might be.
16:48  Lazylegs: I've done table based layouts
16:49  saba: Lazylegs: and what is your conclusion?
16:49  Lazylegs: But that's long time ago, before the change of millenia
16:49  Lazylegs: They suck

16:49  KenBW2: saba: i had to deal with someone else's crappy table layout. All i had to do was change the width of one column. I change the number by X px and it changes nothing. Change it by X+10px and it makes the whole damn table screw up
16:49  KenBW2: theyre unpredictable

16:51  saba: hehe
16:51  bazzo: Anyone knows a good css tabs tutorial without the use of javascript? Everything must be one page as well, no seperate pages for each tab
16:52  KenBW2: saba: if i specify a width on something, i expect it to be that width. Not be dependent on its content/adjacent cell/phase of the moon
16:52  MauriceJ: KenBW2: Have you tried divining rods?
16:52  KenBW2: Maurice: huh?
16:53  saba: I definitely buy that it's harder to re-design
16:53  KenBW2: saba: what more do you want
16:53  speak: bazzo if you don't want to have to refresh your page when opening a new "tab", you'll have to use javascript in some form

16:54  MauriceJ: I believe saba had nothing better to do and decided to come in here and stir.  *Getting back to work*
16:54  KenBW2: Maurice: what am i looking at :S
16:55  bazzo: speak: hmm, yeah, youve got a point
16:55  saba: I am pretty bored at work, that's true MauriceJ  :-)
16:55  MauriceJ: KenBW2: I was making a joke about table layout, working with them, and your comment about 'phase of the moon.'
16:55  saba: KenBW2: I'm not sure :-)
16:56  KenBW2: saba: then stay OT or GTFO
16:56  saba: you might save time not doing cross browsing fxies.
16:56  KenBW2: MauriceJ: sorry, never heard of divining rods before *rolls eyes*
16:56  speak: :D
16:56  saba: my conclusion is that you should stay off table layouts, but everything is relative
16:57 * KenBW2 thinks "everything is relative" is a meaningless phrase used by people with no actual argument

17:06  bazzo: KenBW2: the implementation im gonna use it in doesnt have variable height
17:07  bazzo: KenBW2: nothing :)
17:07  KenBW2: bazzo: so why contrain your CSS to avoid it?

18:37  ZombieLoffe: IamTrying, CSS3 has the transform property, but it's only supported in newer versions of Fx and Webkit browsers (no IE)
18:37  ZombieLoffe: Well, IE9 maybe
18:38  zulax: is it possible to make an entire li tag have href property instead of just the text?
18:40  IamTrying: ZombieLoffe,  newer versions of Fx/Webkit u mean. Chrome/Safari/Opera/FF/Konqueror/Arora/.... ?
18:41  Memori: zulax: It's not. However you can make your link inside your li display:block; so it takes up the width of it.
18:41  zulax: ok, i will try
18:41  ZombieLoffe: IamTrying: Chrome and Safari. Not sure about Opera, I don't think so. No clue about Konq or Aurora
18:41  ZombieLoffe: arora, even
18:43  IamTrying: ZombieLoffe,   ic thanks!!, maybe its too early to go for this and face cross browser compatibility issues. how you would take the risk if you have to do it now ? with css simply or little more js on it ?
18:43  PLATO: Hey guys, I'm still puzzled over this layout. I want users to see two independent panes on the page, possibly iframes. I want one column of nav on the far left, then the two panes on the right. When a user clicks one of the panes, that pane is now selected. If they click a nav link, that link opens in the selected pane, leaving the other pane as is (preferably without reloading it.)
18:43  PLATO: is this possible?
18:44  ZombieLoffe: IamTrying: Either JS, or if it's just a few graphics, use an iamge
18:44  ZombieLoffe: Image, even
18:44  ZombieLoffe: PLATO: Sounds like good old frames.
18:45  IamTrying: ZombieLoffe,  i have lots of language for non english character is difficult like arabic/chinese/hindi etc
18:45  ZombieLoffe: And by "good old" I mean "bad old you should not use these"
18:45  PLATO: zombie: can I set the target of a link to open in a specific, other frame
18:45  PLATO: i just don't see how to get by with only one nav bar, with frames
18:46  ZombieLoffe: PLATO: oh, no, not like that. At least not without JS or something powering it.
18:47  IamTrying: ZombieLoffe,  thank you
18:48  Memori: PLATO: You can by naming your frame and using target="framename", but it sure won't validate.

21:54  daviddoria: what is the easiest way to send a different (simpler) page when a page is requested by a mobile device?
21:57  AMcBain: a) organize the site content in such a way it doesn't matter, or b) make a special mobile version and have people bookmark and visit that directly.
21:57  AMcBain: Those are my suggestions. There's obviously always a c), but if you think about it most major sites like, say, Google have m.google.com ...
21:58  AMcBain: ah, that does something else now ... well, somewhere they do have a mobile version of the site.
21:59  AMcBain: http://www.google.com/xhtml ah, here's at least one.
21:59  daviddoria: so how would i make website.com automatically go to website.com/mobile if on a mobile device?
22:00  AMcBain: *headdesk* kinda defeats the purpose of my suggestion, here's why: The resaon I suggest a and b is that devices are coming out or changing a lot, and rather than try to figure out which ones to serve the mobile site to, just have the user do it. If you make mention on your main site about the mobile site in a way that's noticeable, they'll probably remember and be more likely to head there first.
22:01  AMcBain: You can also use meta tags to make it more apparent to search engines that the mobile site is for mobile browsers, and they may (I really have no idea) direct people they detect as mobile there in search results (offloading the work for that)
22:01  daviddoria: I see
22:02  MauriceJ: daviddoria: There's some useful information here as well regarding that, can't remember exactly where on the site but have a go: http://www.quirksmode.org/
22:02  AMcBain: Essentially what you're asking about is pretty much "device sniffing" or "browser sniffing" that's not the easiest field of landmines to walk through.
22:03  daviddoria: I can't believe this is not built into something yet
22:03  AMcBain: and given that there's quite a few desktop browsers as there are mobile browsers, it's not effective to use a whitelist for regular content.
22:03  daviddoria: like if(mobile) redirect "/mobile"
22:03  AMcBain: because that requires sniffing!
22:03 * AMcBain .oO( does he read what I type? )
22:03  daviddoria: that's fine - let it sniff! just as long as I don't have to see it
22:03  MauriceJ: oO
22:05  AMcBain: daviddoria, if you really are adamant about not taking the easy way out, and having two sites and letting the users take care of it (users aren't stupid; if there's an obvious link or button near the top of the main site to the mobile one, they'll eventually get tired of having to load the main one and remember to go direct), you can try and serve a different stylesheet based on size of the screen, which I believe is possible.
22:06  daviddoria: where/when would you determine the screen size?
22:06  AMcBain: ] media queries
22:06  AMcBain: ]media
22:07  AMcBain: ]css media
22:07  _ZofBot4: css media: http://w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html
22:07  AMcBain: There's at least one labeled "handheld" so you could have it so that mobile ones restructure and/or hide content to appear different, but users are still downloading everything.
22:07  ZombieLoffe: http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/mediaqueries
22:07  AMcBain: yeah, that.
22:08  ZombieLoffe: I'm not sure how support for that looks, AMcBain... last I checked, most mobile browsers identified themselves as ´screen´, not ´handheld´ (cause they're silly)...
22:08  ZombieLoffe: I could be wrong.
22:08  AMcBain: heh, I wouldn't know.
22:08  AMcBain: I've only got one "mobile" device, and I didn't buy it for the browser (so you can guess it relatively sucks)
22:08  ZombieLoffe: daviddoria, googling "detect mobile browser" will get you a bunch of tutorials, articles and software related to it...
22:09  daviddoria: ok
22:09  AMcBain: anyway, I'm off to other things, so good luck, but I still stand behind the suggestion that in regards to your original question, the easiest route is just two sites and an obvious "link" from the main site to the mobile so the users can do it themselves.
22:09  daviddoria: yea I agree, I was just curious about the options
22:09  daviddoria: thanks a lot
22:10  mads-: Hi. I'm currently looking to use Segoe UI light as a font for my headlines on my site. Does anyone know if some fonts are copyrighted and what about it?
22:11  systemfault: I think segoe ui is copyrighted by microsoft, so you can probably use it with font-family but not with @font-face (I'm no lawyer though)
22:13  ZombieLoffe: That's up to each font's license, mads-... I've no idea about that specific font :3
22:13  mads-: Hmm, I was afraid of that. It's a Microsoft font. When did they ever shy away from a change to earn a dollar?
22:14  mads-: chance*
22:14  ZombieLoffe: Maybe some info here, mads- http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331
22:15  ZombieLoffe: @font-face is still sort of unexplored territory -- font foundries and companies have not set up procedures for dealing with web embedding
22:16  mads-: Thanks for the link.
22:16  AMcBain: mads-, places like fontsquirrel, and foundries like exljbris, have examples and downloads for fonts you can reasonably embed (use with @font-face)
22:16  ZombieLoffe: And google font directory
22:16  AMcBain: You should be able to find one there that is a suitable replacement for the one you want, or if you really, really, want Segoe, a fallback.
22:17  AMcBain: ZombieLoffe, unless I was looking at the wrong page, they seemed to have a shorter list?
22:17  mads-: a fallback? What do you mean?
22:17  AMcBain: mads-, something to load in case the user doesn't have Segeo, considering that you wouldn't legally be able to host Segoe for download with @font-face
22:17  mads-: ah
22:18  mads-: Well thanks. I will give those links a peek then. Hopefully I can find a free alternative there.
22:18  AMcBain: I rather like those from exljbris, and he makes it very plain what can be embedded and how you should do it to comply with his [free] licensing.
22:19  AMcBain: he's also one of the few that, upon reading, makes it clear (I think) that you can convert his fonts to a file format you need if you must, such as to EOT for IE<=8
22:19  AMcBain: Some allow embedding, but don't allow conversion. So if they only give OTF, or TTF, etc, you can't make an EOT or SVG (iDevice browsers)
22:20  AMcBain: but font-squirrel's listing should be safe for that, otherwise they probably wouldn't list it (as they host their own convertor)
22:20 * AMcBain heads off for real this time :P

The page for modern, good browsers is http://bert.is-a-geek.com/bTicket/reskintest.html anyone got a suggestion how to get a working centered form with the

23:16  oksushi: but putting things inside of it with 'height: 100%' will not work

23:26  daviddoria: so oksushi, how do you suggest I display my 15 links if I can't use dropdowns?
23:27  oksushi: daviddoria: have a look at the 'inverted L' design pattern
23:29  daviddoria: I guess I don't get which links you put on the left and which you put on the top
23:30  oksushi: the top links are the main 'sections', the ones on the left would be the individual pages within those sections
23:31  oksushi: you only display the relevant side links once the user has clicked into the section
23:31  daviddoria: but then those "sections" have to have a page
23:31  daviddoria: where right now i just have collections of links that don't have a "super page"
23:31  oksushi: daviddoria: yes, they do
23:32  oksushi: a 'section page' could include a description of the section, then links to the sub pages underneath
23:32  daviddoria: So on those pages I just have to put some nonsense text which they ignore and just go to the links that they would have gone to from the drop down menu?
23:32  oksushi: …
23:33  oksushi: hey, do what you want, it's your site. I’m just letting you know about good usability practice.
23:33  daviddoria: no, no, I really appreciate it
23:33  daviddoria: I want to do that, because it solves many of my problems
23:33  daviddoria: (the drop downs dont work in IE7, all kinds of different problems on different mobile devices, etc)
23:34 * oksushi nods
23:34  daviddoria: I just am afraid the content on these section pages will be too "thin"
23:34  daviddoria: and "look like" a place holder that is just pointing at these other links
23:34  dumont: damn it... i can't figure this out!
23:34  oksushi: daviddoria: that becomes an information architecture issue then
23:36  daviddoria: like on the "Events" section page, I would just say "check out our [upcoming events]. We also have a [Calendar]. You could read our [News] or past [Newsletters]"
23:36  daviddoria: but that would look very amateur
23:37  oksushi: not at all. That would be a good example of in–page linking
23:39  daviddoria: is "in-page" linking the same as "anchors"?
23:40  oksushi: sure
23:40  oksushi: i just mean, anchors within content
23:40  webben: daviddoria: <a href="#foo"> where foo identifies a fragment of the document is in-page linking.
23:41  daviddoria: yea, thanks webben
23:42  daviddoria: but if all the content is not on the one "section" page, then that sentence about "go here, go there" is the only content (out-page linking? haha) and it will look silly
23:42  daviddoria: I need to read some info architecture it sounds like
23:43  oksushi: webben is quite right, in-page linking was not the correct description to use
23:43  webben: daviddoria: I think if you cannot write a paragraph summarizing a group of links in a dropdown, it's probably not a sensible category of links.
23:44  daviddoria: ok, yea I agree
23:44  daviddoria: I'll work on doing that
23:44  daviddoria: thanks all
23:44  dumont: I beg you to show me how to make the div displaying white background expand so as to cause the footer to hit the bottom of the viewport http://www.webdevout.net/test?01e
23:44  webben: daviddoria: To give a trivial example, if you had a "Products" dropdown and all the products were very different, you could at least highlight some selected items on the /products/ hubpage.
23:45  daviddoria: yea
23:46  dumont: you can see it break when you set #contents height:800px;
23:50  orflon: how could I center an image? two or three ways that I saw after searching the web don't do the job :/
23:54  Madmartigan: explicit width with margin:X auto; may work
23:55  Madmartigan: text-align center to the parent will as well if the image isnt floated
23:57  dumont: please show me how to make the div displaying white background expand so as to cause the footer to hit the bottom of the viewport http://www.webdevout.net/test?01e , the intention is to have the #contents and #nav_expand expand to fill the page all the way down until the text in the contents fits
