08:45  iaj: hey there
08:45  agu10^: it's like going backwards at least 7 years
08:45  iaj: how could I select the first appearing div.block class in a div#right  ?  isn't it div#right div.block:firstchild   ?
08:45  preaction: i'd say cite your sources
08:46  agu10^: http://www.touchmobile.fr/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/iphone4-vs-iphone-3gs.jpg
08:46  agu10^: an image is worth more than a thousand words
08:46  preaction: iaj: no, :firstchild only matches when a tag is the first child of the parent, not the "first instance of the rest"
08:47  preaction: agu10^: i had both. i liked the 4 better. sat flat, no rocking. felt less fragile
08:47  agu10^: hmm
08:47  iaj: preaction: can I somehow match the first item as well?
08:47  preaction: was harder to cover the bottom speakers with your hand
08:47  preaction: iaj: add another class to it? or try your luck with a css3 selector?
08:47  agu10^: I like this one better: http://img.pistolshrimp.mobi/funnyphotos/originals/11851.jpg
08:48  dravekx: check this out.. LOL
08:48  dravekx: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD188LlRBGM
08:48  iaj: preaction: not so easy to add another class - is that the only way?
08:48  preaction: iaj: or, as i said, try your hand with a css3 selector
08:48  dravekx: duct tape = GOD
08:53  iaj: preaction: selectorGadget, is that a nice one?
08:53  systemfault: I never had signal problems though
08:54  iaj: preaction: my problem is on http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=7 , and http://fuel-management.de/index.php?id=9  the 2 yellow boxes on the right, the one coming at first on the right side shouldn't receive the margin-top: 1em;  how would a wise guy fix that :)

09:05  jones-: Hi.
09:05  jones-: I have an UL with 3 inline LIs.
09:06  jones-: In the first LI there's a very large text, and in the other 2 there is small text.
09:06  jones-: It appears that the small texts are top-aligned with the big text, while I'l like them to be bottom aligned.
09:06  jones-: I have played with vertical-align but to no avail.
09:06  jones-: Can anybody help me out?
09:12  oksushi: jones-: url?
09:13  oksushi: jones-: because something like http://www.webdevout.net/test?0-&raw works fine
09:15  msafi: Anyone know why the Facebook comment box doesn't show correctly when you click on the "Like" button in the sidebar here http://winkpress.com/wordpress-ads-management/ ?
09:15  oksushi: msafi: 'correctly' means what?
09:15  msafi: oksushi, overflowing parts are hidden
09:16  msafi: oksushi, it's chopped off. You can't see the button that says "Post to Facebook"
09:16  jones-: oksushi: astrobin.com/1
09:16  oksushi: msafi: you are setting a height on the iframe
09:16  jones-: oksushi: check the title, author and "contains" right below the big image
09:17  msafi: oksushi, I'm not. It's supposed to be dynamically generated using Facebook's own JavaScript
09:17  jones-: oksushi: and when I said large text, I meant large font size.
09:17  oksushi: jones-: you are floating them
09:18  oksushi: vertical-align will not work on floated items
09:18  jones-: Oh.
09:18  jones-: Let me see if I can have the same layout without floating them then :)
09:19  jones-: oksushi: ok, it works for the middle one, but don't I have to float the right most one to have it on the right?
09:19  jones-: I guess I could specify manual widths?

09:26  crackguy: i am trying to place an image on a page using a free float (position: absolute) property. i am trying to place it over some text. since the image has an opaque background and though must be displayed over the text making the text hide at the back of the page, but for some reason the image is working as it is a transparent image and thus displaying the text and the picture both working as transparent objects over each other..

09:41  ketil: I'm using the 'gitit' wiki, which is great except for one thing: headers (h1-h5) are in black, even when they are links.  Any way to remedy this?  I'm a complete n00b at CSS.
09:42  oksushi: crackguy: #text {top: 67px; left: 592px;}

09:44  crackguy: oksushi done. please check http://crackguy.net/fb_like
09:44  oksushi: crackguy: you need to adjust the left value
09:45  crackguy: oksushi but I want to place the image to the right side of the Like button.
09:46  oksushi: yes… I assumed you meant you want it over the other text
09:46  crackguy: that's right..
09:46  oksushi: so, adjust the left value. You also want to give it a z-index value, and 'background: #fff;' so it covers the Failbook text
09:47  crackguy: oksushi over the text (7 people like this.) and I want that text to disappear or hide behind the image
09:47  ketil: oksushi, thanks.  I'll give it a try.

09:48  crackguy: oksushi sorry, i don't know much about z-index and set background #fff of what element?
09:51  oksushi: #text
09:51  oksushi: crackguy: ^^
09:53  crackguy: oksushi, oh thanks. z-index done the job :)
09:53  oksushi: :)
09:54  crackguy: oksushi, would different screen resolutions place the item in different coordinates?
09:54  oksushi: no
09:56  oksushi: you would need to use media queries to achieve that
09:58  ketil: oksushi, that worked.  I'm curious, in my original css, it says: h1 > a:visited { properties;}   --- is the > meaningful?

10:00  _ZofBot4: ketil, CSS Selectors: 1) read: http://xrl.us/bemweo [CSS2.1] http://xrl.us/bemwem [CSS3], http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/ , http://www.csarven.ca/css-specificity-and-selectors 2) Try it out: http://penguin.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py
10:08  ketil: Thanks!  I've looked at an ancient FAQ, and that sorted out some of the stuff (although it lists child selector as ~).  I'll check the other links.
10:08  oksushi: yw
10:29  ketil: _ZofBot4, (or oksushi): does any of the links explain how things are overridden?  It seems more specific selectors override more general ones, and if selectors are the same, the last seen is the one that counts.  Is that correct?
10:30  ketil: And a property list only changes explicitly listed properties, you can't "empty" a property list or delete a definition - but you can specify text-decoration: none.

10:56  gym_jane: i have four divs inside a parent div, how can i centre them inside the parent div?
10:57  gym_jane: the parents div has a padding of 6 px
10:57  gym_jane: child divs are 188px width
10:59  MauriceJ: gym_jane: Do you have a URL or testcase that can be looked at?
10:59  MauriceJ: It's hard to give assistance just from verbal descriptions.
10:59  gym_jane: let me put it on webdevout
10:59  gym_jane: one sec please
11:00  MauriceJ: gym_jane: Ta.
11:03  gym_jane: Here http://www.webdevout.net/test?04
11:06  gym_jane: also lets say if i remove one of those boxes some time in the future how can i make sure they stretch gracefully? at the moment i have fixed width which is not that flexible
11:07  MauriceJ: Plus the float:left will insure they don't fill the width properly as well.  Hrm...
11:11  gym_jane: MauriceJ i have been looking around for ages but couldn't  find anything :/
11:12  MauriceJ: gym_jane: I can understand why, this isn't the simple fix I thought this sounded like, at first.
11:12  MauriceJ: oksushi kenobi, please help us, you're our only hope!

13:45  LachlanH1: Hmm ok. That worked. What if the child div has a dynamic width? To fit its contents for example.
13:46  eighty4: if you don't set a width on a div it'll be "100%"
13:46  eighty4: if you do inline-block text-align will work

13:54  ZombieLoffe: chilli0: Floated elements can't be centered with text-align. Instead of using float: left; you could use display: inline; to achieve horizontal alignment, or display: inline-block; if you need a width/height set (needs a small fix to work in ie < 7)

14:55  farhad2010: test all
14:56  eighty4: traceto: trust no one and read up on it instead.
14:56  bloopletech: traceto: if it helps I actually quoted the HTML5 spec :)
14:56  eighty4: traceto: I assume you trust opera for example
14:56  MauriceJ: farhad2010> just <body><center>content</center></body>
14:56  MauriceJ: farhad2010: What kind of misinformation are you doling out in here?!
14:56  eighty4: traceto: and if it helpt farhad2010 would have been kicked by now I an op was active
14:56  bloopletech: MauriceJ: troll misinformation that's what
14:57  MauriceJ: bloopletech: Too bloody right!
14:57  bloopletech: Though technically his solution will work ;)
14:57  MauriceJ: If anybody is noob enough in here <center> has been deprecated since quite some bloody years ago - do NOT use it.
14:57  Jackass4D: (^O^)
14:57  MauriceJ: Stay away from farhad2010 and stay away from W3schools.
14:58  MauriceJ: http://w3fools.com/
14:58  eighty4: the problem with html/css is that things that worked 10 years ago still works and will likely still work in 10 years :)
14:58  bloopletech: MauriceJ: oh man I didn't know about that onw
14:58  farhad2010: MauriceJ: r u GOD of HTML?
14:58  farhad2010: I am sure u r
14:58  Jackass4D: lol
14:58 * Jackass4D bitch slap farhad2010
14:59  Dartfall: Don't be trolling on matters of grave importance, guys!
14:59  MauriceJ: farhad2010: compared to you I sure am. :/
14:59  bloopletech: time for some fun
14:59  farhad2010: GOD bless me PLZ
14:59  bloopletech: farhad2010: what do you think about ruby on rails?
14:59  MauriceJ: bloopletech: LOL
15:00  bloopletech: MauriceJ: hey I'm just getting started here
15:00  MauriceJ: farhad2010: For $20/hour I'll bless you with my CSS help.
15:00  MauriceJ: bloopletech: Haha, you gwan, mate. :D
15:01  farhad2010: Kick me out Please!
15:01  bloopletech: no no  stay and argue with us!
15:04  koskoz: hi guys
15:04  farhad2010: min-height: 0; is enough for haslayout?
15:05  koskoz: is it possible to have a list in which li doesn't go back to a new line if they reach the max width of the ul but insteand the text inside each li breaks to a new line ?
15:06 * ComradeHaz` feels like a troll he's so shit at css / html :D
15:06  ComradeHaz`: Hello all! :)
15:06  Jackass4D: wathek, i'd like to help but your scripts seem to be bogging down my IE 8
15:06  wathek: Jackass4D, hein ?!
15:06  bloopletech: farhad2010: zoom: 1 will also trigger it
15:06 * ComradeHaz` poke MauriceJ in the ribs and runs off giggling
15:06  ComradeHaz`: *pokes
15:07  MauriceJ: farhad2010: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=haslayout+fix
15:07  MauriceJ: ComradeHaz`: G'day
15:07  ComradeHaz`: 'lo mate :D
15:07  bloopletech: koskoz: yes, by floating the li elements within the ul
15:07  dravekx: floaties
15:07  Jackass4D: you understand that loll...
15:08  koskoz: bloopletech: my li are floating, but they are going back to a new line too
15:08  bloopletech: koskoz: huh? give us a link to a live example
15:09  bloopletech: koskoz: you can use http://webdevout.net/test to generate an example if you only have the code loally
15:09  dravekx: koskoz, lolwut
15:09  Jackass4D: koskoz, specifies the height for it
15:09  Jackass4D: I promise you it won't break new line
15:10  Jackass4D: ul {height: 30px}
15:10  MauriceJ: koskoz: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/taminglists/
15:10  bloopletech: Jackass4D: stop trolling
15:10  Jackass4D: or something like that
15:10  bloopletech: MauriceJ: also probably best not to link to 8-year-old articles :D
15:11  farhad2010: lol
15:11  MauriceJ: bloopletech: It's still quite good, ages doesn't mean FA here mate.
15:11  bloopletech: MauriceJ: it does when it talks about Netscape, Mate
15:11  farhad2010: lololol
15:11  MauriceJ: bloopletech: It's still a link presented in here as being quite relevant by even the most skilled folks in here.
15:11  Jackass4D: floats drop down when it exceeds the width no? bloopletech?
15:12  MauriceJ: bloopletech: That's not something to worry about, again the best folks in here recommend that link as well as it's still quite relevant.
15:12  bloopletech: MauriceJ: The css in the document is actually quite correct so it's fine for that, :)
15:13  MauriceJ: bloopletech: Precisely.
15:13  bloopletech: Jackass4D: I don't think that'll solve koskoz's problems, plus it'll spew all over anything below it
15:13  koskoz: here is my code : http://www.webdevout.net/test?012
15:13  koskoz: as you can see my li are returning to a new line, and I'd like them to return to a new line for their own text
15:13  MauriceJ: koskoz: Check out the link I posted for you.
15:13  bloopletech: MauriceJ: I just prefer to use more recent documents when I can because some of the older ala stuff is a bit out of date.
15:14  farhad2010: bye all & bye my GOD MauriceJ
15:14  MauriceJ: bloopletech: Understood but again this is still very relevant.
15:14  MauriceJ: farhad2010: Allahu Akbar, ana magnoun.
15:15  bloopletech: Plus we should be erasing all mention of any version of netscape from existence :D
15:15  bloopletech: MauriceJ: don't take it too seriously
15:15  MauriceJ: bloopletech: Nothing is sacred (except every sperm).
15:15  MauriceJ: Peace out I have to finish some work here.
15:16  bloopletech: koskoz: I don't understand what you want ... do you mean you want the menu to be a vertical list of items?
15:16  Jackass4D: yea, bloopletech good luck with koskoz
15:16  Jackass4D: chaow
15:16  bloopletech: bye
15:16 --- grainol_ is now known as grainol
15:17  koskoz: bloopletech: I want my menu to stay on one line, even if this line is taller
15:17  koskoz: wait, I have a screen
15:19  koskoz: bloopletech: I want that :
15:19  koskoz: http://www.pixelz.fr/5/d/6/49793a4de6064ce70d85da967d10a.html
15:19 --- jamesastor-perri is now known as Cozz
15:19  bloopletech: koskoz: ohhh right. hmm
15:20  koskoz: as you can see some text inside the li is going to a new line instead of expanding the li (and I can't fix the li's width cause I don't know how many there will be)
15:22  bloopletech: koskoz: hmm. Maybe you can set all the li's to be display: inline isntead of inline-block, and set a width only on the ul
15:23  koskoz: bloopletech: already tried
15:25  bloopletech: koskoz: thinking about it
15:26  bloopletech: koskoz: I believe a table will actually do what you want, just trying to think of a better solution
15:27  bloopletech: hmm actually I am partway to a solution
15:29  koskoz: ok bloopletech, thanks
15:29  ZombieLoffe: display: table-cell; is the only way to achieve the effect with just css, and it's not supported in ie < 8
15:29  ZombieLoffe: (@ koskoz)
15:30  bloopletech: ZombieLoffe: so there's absolutely no way to get a display: inline element to do the wrappng?
15:30  koskoz: ZombieLoffe: well I'm guess I'm f***** since I need to make it compatible with ie6+
15:30  ZombieLoffe: use JS, would be my advice
15:31  koskoz: ZombieLoffe: can you explain my what I need to do in js ?
15:31  carpet_the_walls: can a legend be positioned inside a fieldset border?
15:31  bloopletech: koskoz: you can (a) put in a table which will work perfectly (b) make all the elements the same width, which will wrap them correctly (c) something crazy
15:32  bloopletech: koskoz: TBH I think using JS just to avoid having to put in a table is cutting the nose to spite the face, but I dunno.
15:32  bloopletech: OTOH it *is* just to support ie6
15:33  SuitCase: http://www.bittersweetcandybowl.com/forum/topic/304-word-association-game/ - simple horizontal list floating problem, having a lot of trouble working it out! the little ul.breadcrumb on this page does not stay "in line", the <li>s after the first one drop down a few pixels in moz and opera, but look fine in webkit.
15:33  SuitCase: what's wrong here? the relevant css is in ipb_styles.css under /* @group Breadcrumbs */
15:33  SuitCase: i've tried playing with padding and margin, setting them to 0, trying line heights, setting height on the <li>s, nothing seems to get them in line
15:34  bloopletech: SuitCase: the breadcrumb looks good to me in ff3.6
15:35  SuitCase: bloopletech: interesting! on the mac it doesn't
15:35  bloopletech: SuitCase: hmmmmmm. what ver of ff is it?
15:36  SuitCase: 3.6.13
15:36  bloopletech: very strange
15:36  bloopletech: so the vertical alignment is screwy?
15:37  koskoz: bloopletech: I think my customer will spit on my face if he shows any table used to layout the page :/
15:37  bloopletech: koskoz: then I suggest you duck
15:38  iaj: is it possible to have a custom image as a background for input: text fields?
15:38  bloopletech: oh jesus emo comic *and* furryu
15:38  bloopletech: iaj: yes
15:38  SuitCase: bloopletech: http://img.soaringrabbit.com/alignmentissue.png opera, firefox, safari in that screenshot
15:38  bloopletech: iaj: just set background-image for the input element
15:38  bloopletech: SuitCase: lemme see
15:40  bloopletech: SuitCase: you have firebug right?
15:40  SuitCase: yes
15:40  iaj: bloopletech: i still couldn't figure out why i need to margin-top like 5em before I can actually see a change with firebug on my page?
15:41  bloopletech: SuitCase: try disabling the global font rule
15:41  bloopletech: See if that changes the vertical alignment
15:41  bloopletech: iaj: I don't know either :/
15:41  SuitCase: i don't really know what you mean by that
15:41  SuitCase: if it's a firebug thing i'm not a firebug expert
15:42  bloopletech: SuitCase: oh right. Well highlight the ul with firebug, then scroll down the style list, then hover over the font: rule, a no symbol should appear next to it, click the no symbol
15:47  ComradeHaz`: Hi all, could someone explain to me why padding the left of my 'Content' container doesn't seem to do anything?  http://lithitux.org/~haz/
15:48  SuitCase: bloopletech: interesting discovery! fixed ff but not opera :(
15:48  bloopletech: SuitCase: I'd say the ff issue is a line-height problem. You may want to set an explicit font size and line height for that section
15:49  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: there's no left-padding in that stylesheet...
15:50  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: you have a padding-top but no padding-left
15:50  ComradeHaz`: Well, I know, I've taken it out again
15:50  ComradeHaz`: It doesn't sseem to do anything
15:50  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: well then put it back in and show us
15:50  bloopletech: hang on actually
15:50  ComradeHaz`: Look now.
15:51  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: the padding-left ignores the floated element, so you'll need to make the left padding the width of the sidebar + the padding you want between the sidebar and the content
15:52  ComradeHaz`: Oh, of course.
15:52  ComradeHaz`: Duh!
15:52  ComradeHaz`: :D
15:53  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: also, you can put the font rule in the body {} ruleset and it'll apply page-wide
15:53  ComradeHaz`: So, actually, I should probably ask now. I am trying to reqrite this site: http://harriersview.com/newSite/HarriersView/Cottage.html
15:53  bloopletech: instead of repeating it throughout the css doc
15:53  ComradeHaz`: Should I make another load of containers within content to make that?
15:54  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: to me the layout should be:
15:54  ComradeHaz`: Um, but I have different fonts in the nav bars..
15:54  bloopletech: wrapper div around the whole thing, vertically centered
15:54  bloopletech: a header div in that with a background image with the eagle and crap (transparant bg)
15:55  bloopletech: the wrapper div having a vertically-repeating background image of the light colour and the dark green colour
15:55  SuitCase: bloopletech: i applied a height, line-height and px-based font size. still weird in opera.
15:56  bloopletech: after the header div, have a nav div and a content div, with width on the nav div and padding left on the content div
15:56  bloopletech: within the content div, the image can just be floated right
15:56  bloopletech: the stuff below... floated divs for each image/link
15:56  bloopletech: make sure to clear your floats at the end
15:56  ComradeHaz`: :S
15:56  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: you can set the font different for just the navbar: that's that the Cascade in Cascading stylesheets means
15:57  bloopletech: SuitCase: re opera, no idea I don't use it :)
15:57  ComradeHaz`: thing is, this is only day 4 of my programming in css / html
15:57  bloopletech: SuitCase: is it having the same problem as in firefox?
15:57  ComradeHaz`: it'd take me ages to redo all this
15:58  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: well what I just described isn't hugely different to how it is now
15:58  bloopletech: but that's just my advice - do what you like - you can doe the floated images wothout having to do the other stuff I mentioned
15:58  ComradeHaz`: assuiming I don't massively reengineer it, can I just do what you said last and make more divs in my content?
15:58  bloopletech: Also, try to develop a habit of formatting and indenting your code well
15:58  bloopletech: it'll pay off, trust me
15:58  ComradeHaz`: Um, I do do
15:59  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: yeah you can just add more divs
15:59  ComradeHaz`: It looks neat in my editor :S
15:59  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: ha well the ending braces don't all line up and some of the rules are indented more than others
16:00  bloopletech: also, if a font name is multiple words, wrap it in quotes like "Times New Roman"
16:00  ComradeHaz`: Oh, the CSS is a bit, true
16:00  ComradeHaz`: OK.
16:00  bloopletech: the html is reasonable though still a bit screwy. It's probably got a combo of spaces and tabs in it
16:00  ComradeHaz`: Actually, can I set the font family just once?
16:00  ComradeHaz`: Ah, possibly
16:01  bloopletech: see if you can configure your editor to either only indent spaces or only indent tabs (I prefer spaces personally)
16:01  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: yes you can
16:01  ComradeHaz`: Um, notepad++
16:01  bloopletech: most properties are inherited by the children elements
16:01  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: yeah you probably can configure that
16:01  bloopletech: so if you set it on body, then the children (and their children) etc. will inherit that rule
16:02  ComradeHaz`: Right, I'll have a play :)
16:03  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: cool
16:03  bloopletech: also, why do people put a backtick at the end of their name? I don't get it
16:04  plainas: can i make a multi level cascading menu using CSS only? is it possible?
16:05  bloopletech: plainas: yes, though it may not work in old browsers
16:06  ComradeHaz`: For me it's because in my main channel our bot has exactly the same KVirc nick colours as me, and since she's been there for years, and all of us use KV, when I started hanging in out in there a few years ago it was the easiest thing to do.
16:07  ComradeHaz`: We changed the bot to start with but everyone kept thinking I was the bot :D
16:07  bloopletech: ok... I don't get what the backtick has to do with that though, are you saying all those people use a backtick as well?
16:07  bloopletech: or that the backtick denotes something special?
16:08  ComradeHaz`: Well, the colour of the nick o KVirc is a hash of the nickname characters
16:08  bloopletech: oh right
16:08  bloopletech: wacky
16:08  ComradeHaz`: so some people's 'propper' nick might result in horrible colours
16:08  ComradeHaz`: Also, of course, if a nick is taken adding a back tick makes it unique again
16:09  ComradeHaz`: probably like nikki` who was in here yesterday
16:09  bloopletech: yeah makes sense
16:09  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, nikki is taken
16:09  plainas: bloopletech could you link me to an example, or maybe tell me the basic idea behind it?
16:09  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, nikki` is taken
16:10  ComradeHaz`: hopefully now's you can see a reason for it bloopletech, it won't irritat you as much ;) :D
16:10  ComradeHaz`: *irritate
16:10  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: ha, it's not that irritating :)
16:11  bloopletech: plainas: try googling for css cascading menu, I'm not sure of a apsecific example
16:11  ZombieLoffe: Irritating would be if it was at the start of the nick
16:11  ComradeHaz`: Believe me, what's irritating is when it's at teh start :D
16:11  ComradeHaz`: :D
16:11  ZombieLoffe: :)
16:12  ComradeHaz`: what is the difference between putting something in the body and putting something in a section * { } ?
16:13  ComradeHaz`: I have such a section, but I can't remember why
16:13  ComradeHaz`: :D
16:13  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: * applies to all elements on the page, including input elements etc
16:13  ZombieLoffe: What do you mean?
16:14  bloopletech: putting it in body applies it to the children, but not to some elements like input etc.
16:14  ComradeHaz`: input elements?
16:14  ComradeHaz`: forms etc?
16:14  ZombieLoffe: It does apply to them too, bloopletech
16:14  bloopletech: ZombieLoffe: but setting a font on the body doesn't change the font for input elements
16:15  bloopletech: whereas setting it in * does
16:15  ZombieLoffe: Oh, right, misunderstood what you said
16:16  ComradeHaz`: bloopletech: so in my case I could have just defined the things I have in * in body?
16:16  ZombieLoffe: It's just that browsers set a specific font for inputs instead of doing font-family: inherit;
16:16  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: no, because the margin and padding reset wouldn't be inherited by the children
16:16  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: not every proprty is inherited, only some of them
16:16  bloopletech: ZombieLoffe: yeah
16:16  ComradeHaz`: Hmm, OK :D
16:16  ComradeHaz`: Too much to learn, too little time!
16:16  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: font is inherited so you can set it on the body
16:17  bloopletech: ComradeHaz`: yeah :()
16:17  bloopletech: *:)
16:17  ComradeHaz`: No, :(
16:17  ComradeHaz`: ;)
16:18  ComradeHaz`: hmm, should my main container be an id or a class?
16:18  ZombieLoffe: id
16:18  ZombieLoffe: Use id for unique identifiers, class for multiple.
16:19  ComradeHaz`: o.O
16:19  ComradeHaz`: http://lithitux.org/~haz/
16:19  ZombieLoffe: each id can onyl be used once per page while the same class can be used multiple times
16:19  ComradeHaz`: Have I got it right on there?
16:19  ComradeHaz`: I've had conflicting advice thus  far/
16:19  ZombieLoffe: How's that?
16:20  ComradeHaz`: I had all id's to start with
16:20  ComradeHaz`: but was advised to make them classes yesterday
16:20  ZombieLoffe: then someone gave you bad advice ;)
16:20  ComradeHaz`: id's being by advice in the first place
16:20  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, which one?!
16:20  ZombieLoffe: It's very simple, use id for when you need to identify unique elements, eg. elements that only appear once per page, like #container, etc.
16:21  ZombieLoffe: Use classes when you need to use the same identifier multiple times, lik <li class="whatever">..</li><li class="whatever">..</li>
16:21  Administrator_: Does anyone know how this guy has used anti-aliasing? http://www.grizzlyape.com/
16:21  bloopletech: I'll second ZombieLoffe's statement
16:21  plainas: bloopletech: that's what i did but they all use javascript
16:21  bloopletech: Administrator_: what do you mean antialiasing? On the logo?
16:22  Administrator_: on the text when
16:22  Administrator_: "Grizzly Ape Latest News"
16:22  Administrator_: as is all the text
16:22  Administrator_: i'm using firefox 3.5
16:22  bloopletech: plainas: what about http://www.cssplay.co.uk/menus/drop_examples.html ? that's like the first result
16:23  ZombieLoffe: Administrator_: nothing special -- just the default. See http://www.webdevout.net/test?013
16:23  bloopletech: Administrator_: nothing special, text is usually antialiased in modern browsers :)
16:23  bloopletech: ZombieLoffe: hivemind :)
16:23  ZombieLoffe: Haha
16:23  Administrator_: no  it's using something else i know
16:23  ZombieLoffe: Administrator_, see my link... it's just as anti-aliased...
16:23  bloopletech: Administrator_: no it's not using sifr or cufon or anything
16:24  Administrator_: no iknow it's not using sifr or coufen, it's using something else. Notice the left navigaiton text, it's smoother. this is not the browser
16:24  bloopletech: Administrator_: yes it's called font-weight: bold, setting the color to dark grey, and changing the font to myriad pro
16:25  bloopletech: ADVANCED MAGICK
16:25  ZombieLoffe: hehe.
16:25  ZombieLoffe: Administrator_, http://www.webdevout.net/test?014
16:25  Administrator_: must be windows 7 messing aorund with it
16:26  ZombieLoffe: it's just myriad pro + cleartype
16:26  bloopletech: Administrator_: ...
16:26  ZombieLoffe: if you have myriad pro, that is.
16:26  bloopletech: cleartype has been around since XP too
16:26  ZombieLoffe: yup
16:26  bloopletech: if it helps I'm on ubuntu and it's all antialiased :)
16:26  Administrator_: i think what you guys don't understand is that in opera 11, on windows XP it doesn't smooth it like that.
16:26  Administrator_: so there has to be something going on
16:26  bloopletech: Administrator_: is cleartype turned on on the system?
16:27  bloopletech: (under xp)
16:27  Administrator_: just checked and yes
16:27  bloopletech: both os setups are on an lcd monitor?
16:27  bloopletech: screenshot both of them and link us
16:27  gliese581: you can fake antialias with text-shadow btw
16:28  bloopletech: gliese581: that's good to know, but it's not being applied here
16:28  Administrator_: its only windows 7 (i have windows xp in vmware)
16:28  bloopletech: Administrator_: screenshot or it didn't happen

22:44  ComradeHaz`: trying to work out how I do that in the css
22:44  Tempus2: just like I typed
22:45  Tempus2: You can copy and paste whatever I wrote and it will work
22:45  Reign1: could anyone tell me is there such a thing like column name or i simply add another row for that and style as i like?
22:45  ComradeHaz`: Tempus2: if I copy what you wrote into my css it will effect all links the same way. I want different rules in different divs
22:46  Tempus2: then address the divs first like ermm
22:46  Tempus2: Are the divs ids or classes?
22:46  mateobur: Hello
22:46  ComradeHaz`: I think I've got it
22:46  ComradeHaz`: 30 sec's
22:46 --- Channel #css was synced in 126 seconds
22:46  mateobur: I have a series of <p> with text
22:46  mateobur: I want them to be in different rows each
22:46  mateobur: and I don't want to use <br/>
22:46  mateobur: :D
22:47  Tempus2: ComradeHaz`: do #contentText a:link, #contentText a:visisted{ color: white; }
22:47  Tempus2: But the best would be giving your links classes
22:47  Tempus2: .article_link:hover etc
22:48  ComradeHaz`: Tempus2: I want nothing, not white
22:48  Tempus2: No the color is up to you ;)
22:48  Tempus2: I just put it in there..
22:48  ComradeHaz`: if it adds anything it wraps the last image off the page
22:48  ComradeHaz`: because it makes them bigger
22:48  Tempus2: adds anything?
22:49  soreau: ugh, I need help with errors. Is there a jsfiddle + validator?
22:49  Tempus2: No it just handles the color
22:49  ComradeHaz`: Oh
22:49  Tempus2: the classes are just identifiers in the markup, nothing that has a dimension
22:49  ComradeHaz`: OK, so I have that issue too then
22:49  Tempus2: What issue?
22:49  ComradeHaz`: is there anyway I can stop it adding any colour?
22:49  ComradeHaz`: the fact that in IE a picture drops to next line
22:49  Tempus2: Yes... you define the color yourself mate
22:50  ComradeHaz`: so if I want no colour?
22:50  Tempus2: no color?
22:50  ComradeHaz`: Yes.
22:50  Tempus2: Why would you want no color on text?
22:50  ComradeHaz`: Not on text
22:50  ComradeHaz`: On my images
22:50  Tempus2: Oh you mean the border around it?
22:50  ComradeHaz`: Yeah
22:51  Tempus2: ah img{ border: 0; }
22:51  ComradeHaz`: Um.
22:51  ComradeHaz`: I think you still missunderstand me.
22:51  Tempus2: border-width: 0;
22:51  ComradeHaz`: Have you looked at this in IE?
22:51  Tempus2: Okay let me then
22:51  Reign1: is there such a thing like column name or i simply add another row for that and style as i like?
22:51  ComradeHaz`: If not, please humour me and do so
22:52  soreau: How can I make the middle box's sides move toward the center? http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/
22:52  Tempus2: You didn't want a border around it?
22:53  Tempus2: I see you removed the border
22:53  ComradeHaz`: I want the border, I do not want the additional blue border IE adds to an unclicked image link
22:53  ComradeHaz`: or the purple one for a clicked image link
22:53  Tempus2: There's no blue border in IE
22:53  ComradeHaz`: there is on mine!
22:54  Tempus2: Not on mine
22:54  Tempus2: Oh sorry
22:54  Tempus2: >_<
22:54  Tempus2: Not anymore
22:54  Tempus2: They look almost identical in FF and IE now
22:55  ComradeHaz`: http://lithitux.org/~haz/IEpain.jpg
22:55  legostud: ComradeHaz`: a {text-decoration:none;}
22:55  legostud: just a thought
22:56  Tempus2: Hum, that's underline etc.. isn't it?
22:56  Tempus2: Not the border around linked images
22:56  ComradeHaz`: Doesn't seem to help legostud
22:56  soreau: Can I get some help with this?  http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/I am wondering why there are no bullets for the unordered list and the box around the list is too large horizontally
22:57  ComradeHaz`: Bloody IE
22:57  ComradeHaz`: It's so shit :/
22:57  Tempus2: ComradeHaz`: YOu need to add :visited to your style link
22:57  Tempus2: the purple frame means visisted link
22:58  ComradeHaz`: well, or blue if it's unvisited
22:58  ComradeHaz`: I get them both
22:58  ComradeHaz`: What do you mean add it to my style link?
22:59  Tempus2: sigh why didn't you listen to me you twat...
22:59  ComradeHaz`: o.O
22:59  Tempus2: img{ border-width: 0; }
22:59  Tempus2: You didn't EVEN TRY!!
22:59  ComradeHaz`: Where?
22:59  Tempus2: Anywhere in your stylesheet
22:59  ComradeHaz`: Just new class?
23:00  Tempus2: Just copy paste it on a new lin e
23:00  ComradeHaz`: Ah. OK, I missunderstood. Well, rather, I thought you missunderstood as I was aware I was explaining dreadfully.
23:00  Tempus2: I didn't...
23:01  Tempus2: I though you tried it..
23:01  ComradeHaz`: but indeed that seems to have done it.
23:01  ComradeHaz`: No, so sorry pal
23:01  Tempus2: Try listen next time then
23:01  ComradeHaz`: I wasn't being awkward on purpose
23:01  Tempus2: I understand sorry for calling you things
23:01  ComradeHaz`: OK, so why does that work?
23:01  ComradeHaz`: What does IE do that FF doesn't?
23:02  Tempus2: Because linked images has a border in IE by default
23:02  Tempus2: Anyway, have fun now
23:02  ComradeHaz`: OK, I see
23:02  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, right :D
23:02  ComradeHaz`: Thanks alot though pal
23:02  Tempus2: I got pretty angry when I looked through your source and saw that it was exactly the case
23:03  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, I can understand that
23:03  Tempus2: Anyway, glad you got futher
23:04 --- me1_ is now known as me1
23:04  ComradeHaz`: Thanks. And appologies for missunderstandificationing
23:04  Tempus2: Don't worry, I am not steamed very long

23:05  ComradeHaz`: Good, good :)

23:11  Tempus2: By default
23:11  Tempus2: CSS3 isn't official yet
23:11  Tempus2: You need to specify
23:12  ComradeHaz`: Um, where abouts in teh link do I put that?
23:12  Tempus2: just make a link on your page
23:12  Tempus2: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?profile=css3&uri=referer">Validate CSS3</a>
23:12  ComradeHaz`: I don't follow. Sorry :(
23:13  Tempus2: Just make a link somewhere on your page
23:13  Tempus2: That way you can just click the link to validate it
23:13 --- Channel #css was synced in 127 seconds
23:13  Tempus2: Beside your html-validator link
23:13  Tempus2: Oh I am sorry
23:13  ComradeHaz`: Are you confusing my question and soreau's?
23:13  Tempus2: the link is wrong
23:13  soreau: <Tempus2> http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?profile=css3&uri=referer <-- says IO/Error: referer
23:14  Tempus2: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer?profile=css3
23:14  soreau: ComradeHaz`: I'm just trying to guess who he's talking to ;)
23:14  Tempus2: That works :)
23:15  Tempus2: That's the link I run on my page
23:15  Tempus2: Or my GF's webpage anyway
23:16  soreau: Tempus2: What do you do with that link?
23:16  ComradeHaz`: Tempus2: you seem to have gone off on a tangent? :D
23:16  Tempus2: You wanted to validate as CSS3...
23:16  Tempus2: Here you go!
23:16  Tempus2: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer?profile=css3
23:16  ComradeHaz`: soreau: if you put it on the page you are developing and click it, it takes you to the css checker service
23:16  soreau: If I put it in the browser it just says 'Some Headers, mandatory for this resource, are missing.  - Referer'
23:16  ComradeHaz`: No Tempus2, I didn't soreau did :D
23:17  Tempus2: Oh, ups heh
23:17  ComradeHaz`: :D
23:17 * ComradeHaz` hands Tempus2 a cold beer
23:17  Tempus2: A cold beer would have been so nice
23:17  Tempus2: ANyway, soreau, put that link on your page
23:17  soreau: Tempus2: I don't understand why I need to put it on my page
23:18  Tempus2: <soreau> I am trying to sort out why the shadow code here http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_borders.asp works but it doesn't validate in the css validator here http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
23:18  soreau: can't I just use the normal validator and then set it to css3?
23:18  ComradeHaz`: soreau: you don't, but if you stick it at the bottom it makes checking dead easy
23:18  ComradeHaz`: so, any idea why IE only adds backround to top word on my left hand li?
23:18  soreau: Ah so the checker knows what to do with it?
23:18 --- _sodhi is now known as sodhi
23:18  ComradeHaz`: soreau: yes
23:18  Tempus2: Yes it does ;)
23:18  Tempus2: referer means "the webpage the link was clicked"
23:19  Tempus2: :)
23:19  soreau: What is the deal with IE not supporting any css3? How do you make the page 'backward compatible'?
23:19  ComradeHaz`: Not use IE
23:19  Tempus2: Hehehe....
23:19  ComradeHaz`: fuck IE
23:19  ComradeHaz`: :D
23:19  Tempus2: What's the deal with IE in general :)
23:19  MaxMeents: fuck IE
23:19  Tempus2: What's the deal with people using such a crap browser
23:20  ComradeHaz`: Sheep. All of them.
23:20  llrcombs: the best possible way to support IE is to not support IE
23:20  llrcombs: the only way to win is not to play
23:21  soreau: Tempus2: Ok where do I put this link?
23:21  soreau: Yes but there are all these other people that use IE
23:21  soreau: I want my site to at least not make this IE puke
23:22  MaxMeents: support IE but have a popup EVERYTIME they visit AND every new page with links to better browsers
23:23  soreau: heh
23:24  ComradeHaz`: Yeah, if detect IE place orange text accross site saying your browser is fundamentally flawed and a massive security risk, please get another
23:24  MaxMeents: LOL
23:24  MaxMeents: that sounds good
23:24  ComradeHaz`: Just link to news articles about how shit IE is too.
23:24  JDigital: soreau: CSS3 is new and most browsers support only a little of it
23:25  soreau: Right, I understand
23:25  MaxMeents: all government bases use ie... kinda sucks when its not supported
23:25  soreau: JDigital: But I thought there's maybe an official or recommended way to make the code backward compatible
23:25  soreau: but I guess not :)
23:25 --- speak_ is now known as speak
23:26  ComradeHaz`: can one do changing images with just html and css?
23:26  soreau: You mean like fading effect?
23:26  ComradeHaz`: Yeah
23:26  JDigital: ComradeHaz`: try jquery for that
23:27  systemfault: ComradeHaz`: You can only do some things with CSS
23:27  JDigital: soreau: Make the page so it benefits from CSS3, but works fine without it
23:27  systemfault: ComradeHaz`: You can do rollovers if you wnat.
23:27  systemfault: *want
23:27  ComradeHaz`: systemfault: of course, I know that, that's why I asked :)
23:27  JDigital: With IE6, you only have to make it so the page works, even if it doesn't look perfect
23:27  MaxMeents: why can't you use more than one font-family: tag?
23:27  soreau: JDigital: ok
23:27  systemfault: MaxMeents: Sorry?
23:27  MaxMeents: I mean, why won't the last one take effect?
23:27  JDigital: leave the fancy transparency and rounded corners for modern browsers
23:28  MaxMeents: if I had font-family: blaw, font-family: blawblaw  ... why wouldn't blawblaw take effect
23:28  systemfault: MaxMeents: It tried to use the first... if it doesn't exists then the second.... third...
23:28  systemfault: HMm
23:28  MaxMeents: thats what I thought
23:28  MaxMeents: wtf
23:28  MaxMeents: maybe its something else
23:28  systemfault: MaxMeents: You can't expect a system to have all fonts.
23:29  systemfault: Arial is popular on windows...
23:29  systemfault: Helvetica on Macs..
23:29  systemfault: Sans on Linux.. etc.. Then you have "sans-serif" that let's the system use whatever non-serif font it wants.
23:29  systemfault: s/wants/has
23:30  soreau: Can someone help me with this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/5U2qF/ I want the list items centered horizontally and left-aligned and the surrounding box to have a 20px border around the list
23:30  soreau: 20px margin*
23:32  PLATO: you want the list items centered horizontally and left aligned?
23:33  PLATO: do you mean, near the center, but with the first letters lining up?
23:35  PLATO: i have a fiddle that I need help with too, http://jsfiddle.net/MsbTR/
23:36  PLATO: i want the content div on the right to not overflow past the window border. i want it to automatically wrap according to the window width.
23:36  PLATO: i am attempting to copy this tutorial but i'm missing something and I have been starting at it for a solid hour
23:36  PLATO: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/layouts/item/css-liquid-layout-21-fixed-fluid/#top
23:46  Tempus2: I use mostly serif and sans-serif. sans-serif means ermm..
23:46  Tempus2: This article explains it better than me: http://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_font.asp
23:47  Tempus2: "sans" means without which would be "serifs"
23:49  legostud: plato: why do you have 1400px width set on the outer div #container.  sounds like you want that to be 100%
23:49  PLATO: no, i want everything on the page in a 1400 px container
23:49  PLATO: it's hard to read stuff that's 1920 pixels wide on my monitor
23:49  PLATO: i think 1400's a good width for current monitors
23:50  harmaz: when I specify my font that includes whitespace like this: {font-family: I Have Spaces, Sans-serif}, CSS doesn't understand it. help?
23:50  PLATO: put quotes around "i have spaces"
23:50  PLATO: maybe
23:51  temhawk: yes
23:51  PLATO: and put a semicolon at the end
23:51  PLATO: end of "Sans-serif"
23:51  PLATO: idk if Sans-serif is canse sensitive
23:52  legostud: Plato: so the issue is the when the browser window is less than 1400px wide the text extends beyond the browser.
23:52  PLATO: ah
23:52  PLATO: ok
23:52  PLATO: yeah
23:53  PLATO: hmm, well, 1400px should be a max
23:53  PLATO: not an absolute width
23:53  PLATO: it's fine if it's narrower
23:53  PLATO: i expect most users will have it fullscreened but sure
23:53  PLATO: what can I do to make that work?
23:54  legostud: correct, but i'm not how well max-width is supportted
23:54  PLATO: there's gotta be some hack
23:54  Tempus2: better now, than a while ago
23:54  [1]piklu: somebody interested in a little css work, private message me
23:56  piklu: hey
23:56  piklu: back
23:57  PLATO: legostud: can I somehow get the window resolution?
23:59  oksushi|na: piklu: again, #css-lance
23:59  oksushi|na: harmaz: put each font inside quotes: font-family: "Some Font", "something Else", sans-serif;
