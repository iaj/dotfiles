15:02  iaj: lo there
15:11  iaj: ive got a question - i imported a project from eclipse - which is running fine in eclipse - but netbeans yells at me: /Users/iaj/ba/java/Animal/APIExample.java:41: unmappable character for encoding UTF-8 "QuickSort w?hlt ein Element aus der zu sortierenden Liste aus "
15:11  iaj: any way to fix that :O
15:15  iaj: ok got it solved nevermind
16:06  iaj: someone around?
16:16  HebusLeTroll: hello
16:17  Mchl: don't feed the troll!
16:17  HebusLeTroll: xD
16:17  Mchl: ;)
16:17  Mchl: sorry, couldn't stop myself
16:19  HebusLeTroll: i'm wondering, what's the difference beween a java web project and a java free-from project ?
16:20  HebusLeTroll: java web free-form *
16:21  Mchl: your ant scripts vs. predefined ant scripts
16:21  Mchl: I think
16:21  HebusLeTroll: but in a standard "web project" is still can edit build.xml write ?
16:21  HebusLeTroll: write = right**
16:22  Mchl: not sure
16:22  Mchl: I do very little Java
16:22  HebusLeTroll: in fact it s for a javascript project
16:22  HebusLeTroll: but i didn't found any dedicated project template for javascript
16:23  Mchl: use PHP
16:23  Mchl: PHP Project that is
16:23  HebusLeTroll: ok i try thx
16:29  HebusLeTroll: hum i created a new folder in ...\my documents\netbeans project\ and it says "project directory is already a netbeans project" :/
16:29  HebusLeTroll: how can it be ? it's just an empty folder ...
16:34  Mchl: I always let NB handle creating new folders - I get confused myself
16:34  HebusLeTroll: damn and i don't have build.xml, i need to do a task to concatenate all my .js files into only one output .js file :/
16:35  HebusLeTroll: sorry for noob questions but i'm lost xD
16:37  HebusLeTroll: what is the proper way to create a javascript project with ant build script  ?
16:38  Mchl: ah... so you need the build.xml - PHP Project doesn't have that
16:38  Mchl: I guess you need to stick to Java Projects then
16:38  Mchl: or see if you can find JavaScript plugin
17:00  HebusLeTroll: ok looks find with java project thanks
