02:40  photex: Hi folks, I'm trying to figure out how the API for creating task repository plugins is referred to in the documentation. Judging by the Bugzilla and JIRA plugins the UI would appear to be common code, and each plugin just provides a way to communicate with the service.
02:41  photex: I'd like to create a module to add support for Shotgun
02:41  photex: www.shotgunsoftware.com
02:41  photex: would be very useful to us at work
02:41  photex: and it has a java api, so I feel  like I'd mostly just be gluing the pieces together

04:45  RedXIII: I have a project that loads a library (mybatis for example) how can I see all the exceptions a particular function throws?
06:52  scrote: hi
06:52  scrote: I'm trying to create a jar file, via properties > packaging, and I can't find the jar file.
06:59  scrote: where's is it?
06:59  scrote: it's not working.
07:50  tuxtor: scrote, I'm not sure what are you trying to do but the .jar files are built automatically every time when you build your proyect, and you can found it in project_folder/dist
07:50  tuxtor: project*

09:04  scrote: tuxtor: i dont have a dist folder
09:07  scrote: maybe I have environment variables wrong.
09:08  tuxtor: scrote, F11 or Shift+F11
09:09  tuxtor: and the dist folder should appear :)
09:13  scrote: whats the classpath, does that point to javac ?
09:15  tuxtor: scrote, classhpath is a set of dirs that have .jar or .class files that you need for your app
09:15  tuxtor: and yes the basic classpath point to your jdk installation
09:15  scrote: I get these errors tuxtor.  Can you help me address them?  http://codepad.org/nBY55DS8
09:16  scrote: is classpath a bash environment variable where I just set it to a dir via  CLASSPATH=<path>  ?
09:16  scrote: what is the path?
09:16  tuxtor: scrote, seems like you have in /usr/lib/java only a JRE environment in order to create java apps you need a JDK installation
09:16  tuxtor: jdk includes javac the java compiler
09:16  scrote: netbeans let me run my programs with out having these variables set.
09:17  tuxtor: scrote, often netbeans comes with his own JDK
09:17  scrote: So I need to find a JDK, and point classpath to that.  correct ?
09:18  tuxtor: scrote, yes, you could start in Tools -> Java Plattforms
10:04 --- Guest49937 is now known as CGo`Work
10:36  CGo`Work: Hm.
10:36  CGo`Work: I'm not noticing the same problems with my desktop netBeans installation.
10:37  CGo`Work: Javascript does not show up in the "Open As" dialog, nor in the "Code Formatting" tab under tools/options, and JS code is not recognized in .js files or others.
10:37  CGo`Work: It just shows up as plaintext.
10:37  CGo`Work: Using netBeans 6.9 on Ubuntu 10.10
10:37  CGo`Work: *I'm now noticing, I mean.
10:38  CGo`Work: Did something go wrong with a recent update?
10:38  CGo`Work: Also, I don't suppose there's an easy way to do a downgrade to 6.8?
10:39  CGo`Work: PHP plugin is loaded and fully functional. It should be working, and did, until I ran some updates.
10:44  CGo`Work: Looks like I'm not the only one http://forums.netbeans.org/topic30709.html&highlight=javascript
10:50  CGo`Work: Also the installation packages on the NetBeans website are defective, but that's another issue..
10:57  Mchl: strange
10:57  Mchl: I have 6.9.1 on Windows, and it works well
10:58  Mchl: could Windows vs Linux build be that different?
10:58  CGo`Work: Possibly.
10:59  CGo`Work: I thought it was just my config when it was only on my netbook.
10:59  CGo`Work: But every Linux workstation thats been updated netbeans now no longer supports Javascript.
11:01  CGo`Work: I've tried updating the plugins, reinstalling, remaking the files, etc.
11:01  CGo`Work: But the phrase "Javascript" still doesn't occur anywhere in NetBeans, and the code is not highlighted.
11:02  Erthe: Anyone around?
11:03  CGo`Work: This is a problem for me since it's really hard to debug when NetBeans doesn't even highlight brackets, and we've got a lot of debugging to do.
11:15  CGo`Work: Ugh.
11:15  CGo`Work: I'll go see if Eclipse is any good.
