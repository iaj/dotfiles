19:14  webben: I'd like to execute the php command on the contents of an unsaved buffer. Is there any way to do this.
19:14  webben: (essentially running the current unsaved buffer as a php script)
19:15  sheepy: webben, install php5-cli
19:15  sheepy: map <F1> :w !php -l %<CR>

20:03  juliohm: c.vim plugin supports Doxygen documentation natively or i have to install this other plugin by the same author? http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1955
20:05  juliohm: I have to install Doxygen templates, correct?
20:06  fow: What do you mean by "supports"?
20:08  juliohm: fow, i have c.vim installed and working :-) i'm thinking that it support Doxygen, but i don't know how to activate. Maybe i need only to set some variable at Templates global file... like STYLE=doxygen
20:09  fow: Yeah, you didn't answer my question :P
20:12  juliohm: fow, i try to answer... supports = no need extra installation. only settings to change :-)
20:12  fow: When you say that you want Vim to "support" Doxygen, what does this "support" entail? just syntax highlighting and indentation (does one need indentation for doxygen) or what?
20:13  juliohm: aaahhh, i mean generate doxygen comments automatically.
20:14  juliohm: http://pastebin.com/jMKp2vkY
20:14  juliohm: this is the global template file of c.vim
20:15  fow: Then you probably want a plugin like the one you linked
20:15  juliohm: what happens in the first includes? the second is inside a 'if statement'
20:15  juliohm: they ever will be included?
20:16  juliohm: like this: |includefile| = c.comments.template
20:16  juliohm: it's out of any == IF STYLE IS ... ==
20:18  zarac: I can't figure out how to map ctrl_9 and ctrl_9 in normal mode. Any ideas? (nmap <C-0> <C-W>>)
20:18  zarac: ctrl_0 and ctrl_9 is what i meant

20:31  bartj: am unable to install screen.vim
20:32  bartj: I get the following error while trying to install screen.vim - http://pastebin.com/e9U3s5fF
20:33  Raimondi: bartj: That means the tag is in two places in the help files, I wouldn't worry about that. Have you tried to use the plugin?
20:34  bartj: Raimondi, no
20:35  Raimondi: Vimball installs the files first, then runs :helptags to update the help references.
20:35  bartj: Raimondi, I thought it said "error" and froze
20:35  Raimondi: Restart Vim and give it a try.
20:39  bartj: Raimondi, am I missing something...or is my experience just very ugly

20:58  zarac: fow: thanks
20:58  zarac: do you know why this is, btw?
20:59  zarac: It seems kind of strange, they're just normal keys!?
20:59  fow: zarac, well, control characters in the terminal aren't really control+some_key. For example, ^@ is actually NUL and ^I is actually tab
21:00  bartj: instead of using screen.vim, I am trying to use the split feature of GNU screen
21:00  bartj: without success
21:00  bartj: in the sense that when I try to split a window, after the split
21:00  bartj: the other part remains blank
21:01  zarac: fow: OK, but 0 is just a normal character... ?
21:01  zarac: and 9
21:02  bartj: what am I missing anyone?
21:03  bartj: ok ok
21:03  bartj: I'll give screen.vim another shot
21:03  bartj: but, I am not able to understand this:
21:32  juliohm: What Doxygen VIM plugin do you prefer?
21:33  juliohm: This seems great http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=987
21:35  mhi^: Looks good (good description, recent updates), go for it :)
21:37  iaj: which vcs system can you guys recommen?
21:37  iaj: from within vim that is?
21:39  juliohm: mhi^, :-)
21:40  mhi^: juliohm: Best answer I could give, since I don't use any doxygen plugins myself :)
21:41  mhi^: iaj: vcscommand from tpope
21:44  mhi^: Oh, it seems to be from Bob Hiestand. No idea why I thought it would be from tp*pe. I guess I was thinking of http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive which is great for git.
21:47  juliohm: Someone using c.vim plugin?
21:49  homekevin: I found a bug today. At least it looks like a bug to me.
21:49  homekevin: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/284048/
21:49  juliohm: Where are the C/C++ programmers?!
21:50  mhi^: juliohm: What's the real question?
21:50  homekevin: It seems like Vim "leaks" its notion of whether a buffer needs a newline or not from the second buffer into the first.
21:50  homekevin: C divided by C++ is like my favorite language!
21:51  juliohm: homekevin, this language don't exist :-P
21:51  gkatsev: I prefer C=C+1
21:51  juliohm: mhi^, i use c.vim and the author made other plugin to doxygen support. I'm thinking that is possible to integrate the two
21:52  mhi^: You're talking of the shipped ftplugin/c.vim?
21:52  comand: I use C++/Doxygen all the time...
21:52  juliohm: comand, do you use c.vim?
21:52  comand: juliohm: I use what's shipped with vim
21:53  juliohm: mhi^, http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=213
21:53  juliohm: comand, because you don't know this plugin :-)
21:53  juliohm: it's the most amazing plugin ever! :-)
21:53  comand: juliohm: I use snippets
21:54  juliohm: comand, these plugin has snippets and shortcuts too
21:54  mhi^: Yup, I also use snipmate in favour of such a complex plugin :)
21:54  comand: I've looked at c.vim, and each time it seems too menu-driven
21:55  juliohm: for example... to insert a class definition using new... \+cn
21:55  comand: *each time I look
21:56  comand: juliohm: is there some way to customize what's inserted? I don't want the extra comments this plugin appears to insert...
21:56  comand: that's mainly why I've stuck with snipmate
21:56  juliohm: comand, entirely configurable
21:56  comand: e.g.: }; // ---------------- end of class Foo ----------------
21:57  juliohm: comand, the plugin makes it too
21:57  comand: hmm, maybe I'll try it out some time then.
21:57  comand: anyway.
21:59  KukMan: Hi. I can indent selected block in Visual Mode pressing =. But it is not working for html ( all tags stays in one line ). How can I fix this?
22:00  gkatsev: is filetype indent on?
22:02  KukMan: not
22:03  gkatsev: turn it on, then try again :)
22:03  KukMan: gkatsev, Yeah. It is work =)
22:03  KukMan: What is filetype?
22:04  gkatsev: i usually like ':filetype syntax indent on'
22:04  gkatsev: KukMan: so it matched based on the filetype of the file 'foo.html' or foo.js
22:11  homekevin: gkatsev: :filetype syntax? I don't see that in the help.
22:12  gkatsev: er...
22:12  gkatsev: :filetype plugin indent on
22:12  gkatsev: :syntax enable
22:13  homekevin: I just recently figured out :filetype. I thought something was missing.
22:14  homekevin: It really seemed like indenting should be smarter, and now it is!
22:15  mhi^: homekevin: Just make sure you have 'smartindent' disabled ;)
22:15  homekevin: Yeah?
22:15  mhi^: vimgor: smartindent
22:15  vimgor: Don't you mean stupidindent? In all seriousness, 'smartindent' is an obsolete option for C-like syntax. It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype indent on' and be happy.
22:16  homekevin: Oh, I do have it disabled.
22:16  gkatsev: :set smartindent?
22:16  gkatsev: oh, lol, parsed that sentence incorrectly
22:16  homekevin: What's up with cindent being a special option though?
22:17  homekevin: Shouldn't C be the same as everything else?
22:17  gkatsev: no
22:17  homekevin: E.g., having a filetype indent script?
22:17  gkatsev: what about lisp? or python?
22:18  homekevin: gkatsev: But what I mean is, there's no 'lispindent' option or 'pythonindent' option, is there?
22:18  gkatsev: idk
22:19  homekevin: Huh, there is a lispindent() function, and a 'lisp' option.
22:19  mhi^: homekevin: 1) C rocks 2) cindent supports a lot of different indentation styles. See :h cinoptions-values
22:19  {g}: Hey People! On the lower right of my vim window, I see "all". What does that mean?
22:19  fow: I believe the options are from a time before indent plugins. But I don't know for sure
22:20  homekevin: {g}: You are looking at the whole file.
22:20  {g}: homekevin: what else could i look at?
22:20  homekevin: {g}: other possibilities are bot, top, or a percentage
22:20  {g}: homekevin: ah! i see! thanks. how can i get rid of that info?
22:21  homekevin: {g}: See :help 'ruler' for more info.
22:22  homekevin: {g}: You could :set noruler or :set statusline=<your custom statusline here>
22:22  homekevin: {g}: Or maybe :set rulerformat=<something>
22:22 * mhi^ hearts custom statuslines
22:23  {g}: homekevin: ok, thanks!
22:23  homekevin: mhi^: Yeah? I just use 'ruler'.
22:23  homekevin: I've never really tried anything else.
22:23  homekevin: But I'm a total laststatus=2 advocate.
22:24  mhi^: well, it shows me a lot of set options etc.
22:26  homekevin: fow: I missed your comment before, but that sounds about right.
22:28  {g}: how can i show the current setting of "statusline"?
22:28  Raimondi: :set statusline?
22:28  {g}: hmm...
22:29  Raimondi: The ? is part of the command :)
22:29  {g}: oh
22:29  mhi^: homekevin: it's a rather simple one, though: http://d.imagehost.org/0673/statusline.png
22:31  Raimondi: I see some of scrooloose's magic there, isn't it nice? :)
22:31  gkatsev: mhi^: a simple one that takes up over 25 lines of code?
22:31  mhi^: For sure :)
22:32  mhi^: gkatsev: well, simple in "looks"
22:32  gkatsev: lol
22:32  mhi^: I could also put everything in one line, but yeah ;)
22:33  {g}: i meant, how can i see to what statusline is currently set to.
22:33  {g}: ":set statusline?" seems not to do that.
22:33  gkatsev: mine: set statusline=%f%m%r%h%w\ [%{&ff}]\ [TYPE=%Y]\ [A=\%03.3b]\ %=\ [%04l:%04v]\ %P%%
22:34  mhi^: {g}: it does, but you probably did ":set statusline" before and set it to "". So restart Vim and do ":set stl?" again.
22:34  {g}: or maybe it does. hmmm.. but it doesnt seem to work for "rulerformat"
22:34  gkatsev: but that last %P%% is annoying because I get an extra % at the end of my statusbar
22:35  mhi^: it's empty by default
22:35  mhi^: @ {g}
22:35  {g}: mhi^: ok
22:35  homekevin: {g}: what mhi^ said.
22:35  {g}: ok
22:35  homekevin: I was about to say that.
22:35  gkatsev: do you know how to fix my %P%% problem?
22:35  Raimondi: mhi^ is known for using telepathy, homekevin ;)
22:35  homekevin: {g}: So when statusline is empty, 'ruler' determines what appears there.
22:36  mhi^: :)
22:36  {g}: somehow, setting the statusline doesnt do anything here. setting the rulerformat does.
22:36  Raimondi: gkatsev: How do you set your stl?
22:36  gkatsev: Raimondi: i mosted it at 17:33:55
22:36  Raimondi: {g}: You're using ruler not statusilne
22:36  homekevin: {g}: Hmm, maybe what you are looking at isn't a "real" statusbar.
22:36  gkatsev: s/mosted/posted/
22:37  homekevin: {g}: set laststatus=2 to always see a statusbar.
22:37  {g}: homekevin: wwwwoooaaah!!! that ugly thing!
22:37  {g}: now i know what the status bar is :)
22:38  mhi^: hrhr
22:38  Raimondi: gkatsev: Why don't you eliminae the %% at the end?
22:38  homekevin: I forgot that the ruler and statusbar are sort of combined by default.
22:38  {g}: i dont use a statusbar at all.
22:38  {g}: probably disabled it in my vimrc somehow.
22:38  gkatsev: Raimondi: thanks!
22:38  homekevin: {g}: Usually it only shows up when you have more than 1 window
22:39  Raimondi: np :)
22:39  {g}: homekevin: ah! ok. i dont use multiple windows.
22:39  homekevin: {g}: But you use :help, right?
22:40  gkatsev: {g}: why not? multiple windows ftw!
22:40  homekevin: {g}: :help opens a new window, so in that case you'd usually see statusbars.
22:40  {g}: homekevin: yes, true.
22:40  {g}: gkatsev: "ftw"?
22:40  gkatsev: for the win
22:41  homekevin: I used to always read "ftw" as "wtf" backward.
22:42  {g}: and i as "fuck the weather"
22:42  gkatsev: homekevin: well, you're nivekemoh backwards!
22:42  homekevin: gkatsev: Which is as close to emo as I get.
22:42  gkatsev: lol
22:43  Raimondi: lol
22:44  {g}: how can i align the ruler to the right?
22:45  bairui: hehe... I read ftw as something bad when I first saw it here a while back. Did a quick google hit before responding, though, thankfully. :)
22:45  bairui: reminds me of a time a guy asked how to go to the file under the cursor in Vim. I said:    gf    he nearly shat his pants, poor boy. :)
22:45  mhi^: hey bairui
22:46  {g}: When I do "rulerformat=xyz" then xyz i somewhere right from the middle. How can I move it completely to the right?
22:46  bairui: g'day, mhi^ :)
22:46  bairui: g'day, Raimondi :)
22:46  Raimondi: {g}: in  :h 'stl'  there is a flag to do that.
22:46  Raimondi: Good morning, bairui :)
22:46  gkatsev: bairui: lol, what did he think it was?
22:46  bairui: get f$#@ed :)
22:46  mhi^: {g}: ":h 'rulerformat'" It says that the default size is 17 and gives an example how to change that ;)
22:48  tpope:  /ll tpope
22:48  tpope: erp
22:48  mhi^: Sorry for highlighting ;)
22:49  bairui: not all of us have the gods on speed dial ;)
22:49  tpope: ;)
22:50  bairui: hehe - g'day, tpope :)
22:51  {g}: mhi^: i asked how to align it to the right. not how to change the size.
22:54  mhi^: {g}: Oi, then what Raimondi said.
22:54  Raimondi: {g}: You're looking for %=
22:54  Raimondi: Just catch the fish
22:55  bairui: ouch :)
22:55  {g}: Raimondi: yes! thanks!!
22:55  Raimondi: All is well :)
22:58  {g}: :)
23:54  magn3ts: If I posted a colorscheme that I'd forgotten the name of, is there any chance someone could identify it?
23:54  gkatsev: there is a chance
23:54  gkatsev: but possibly not
23:54  gkatsev: vimgor: colorschemes
23:54  vimgor: Get the Vim Color Sampler Pack at <http://tinyurl.com/vimCSP>. If you use Vim in a terminal, then get CSApprox at <http://tinyurl.com/vimCSA> to make gVim themes work perfect from an 88/256 color terminal. Want MORE options, go to <http://tinyurl.com/vimCST>
23:55  magn3ts: http://imgur.com/0DV0F.png
23:55  FernandoBasso: I use CSApprox but I can't change the curor color. Any ideas?
23:58  iaj: magn3ts: molokai
23:58  FernandoBasso: For example, for every colorscheme with a dark or gray background, the curosr color is always too much similar to the background color.
23:59  magn3ts: iaj, you're my hero
23:59  LeoNerd: The cursor is drawn by the terminal, not by vim. vim has no control
23:59  iaj: magn3ts: its my fav - that's your luck :)
23:59  mhi^: FernandoBasso: what LeoNerd said. If you're on Linux, you want to edit .Xdefaults.
