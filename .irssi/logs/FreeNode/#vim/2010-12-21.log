10:47  bairui: Axius: there be dragons... what foldmethod are you using?
10:49  Axius: bairui: I use manual folding.
10:49  bairui: dang if it isn't the unsavable method... :-/
10:53  bairui: Axius: your only recourse is 'sessions'.    *shudder*     :help fold-manual

11:06  FernandoBasso: Is it possible to make taglist highlight the tag in the taglist window more quickly? For example, when I am editing the source, and I move to the variable 'error', it takes a while until taglist highlights the tag in its window.
11:06  bairui: I presume you mean the preview-window here...?
11:07  FernandoBasso: The same if I am in the tag list window, and taglist shows the like of that tag in vim :command-line line, it takes to long. I think when we moved to a tag, taglist should show its contents as soon as possible.
11:08  FernandoBasso: Hmm. It seems that updatetime is responsible for that.
11:09  bairui: sweet
11:09  bsod1: which vim addons are you using to edit html and css files?

13:17  bsod1: FernandoBasso: how can I use it?
13:17  FernandoBasso: bsod1: I don't know. I don't code php. Did you install it?
13:17  bsod1: FernandoBasso: not php, python
13:17  bsod1: FernandoBasso: it's already installed with vim 7
13:18  FernandoBasso: Sorry. I don't code pyton.
13:18  FernandoBasso: bsod1: Did you run :helptags ?
13:18  bsod1: FernandoBasso: no
13:19  FernandoBasso: cd /Users/vimfiles/doc/ (or something similar) and then :helptags
13:20  FernandoBasso: bsod1: Better :helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
13:21  FernandoBasso: bsod1: Do this and report back, please.

13:25  henk_maaier: hi, using tabs, it shows the first char of a directory in it's filename. is it possible to expand that to the first x chars of a directory?
13:27  FernandoBasso: bsod1: It says in the script page to copy the file to $VIMRUNTIME/autoload/
13:27  bsod1: FernandoBasso: actually I found a way to do what I wanted, and now I have a different problem
13:28  bsod1: when I open a docstring, it opens in a new screen I have to manually close it
13:28  FernandoBasso: henk_maaier: I involves scripting to achieve that. I tried once...
13:29  FernandoBasso: bsod1: How are you doing it?
13:29  bsod1: C-X C-O shows the docstring. but after I have to close the docstring screen
13:34  FernandoBasso: bsod1: There must be a help in vim for that.
13:34  FernandoBasso: I don't know where it is, though.

13:59  acidjazz: i got an issue w/ 256 colors in vim and i tested my term and its not my term .. what can i check in vim again?
13:59  robgleeson: acidjazz: t_Co?
13:59  deryni: What issue?
14:00  acidjazz: oys
14:00  acidjazz: its set to 8
14:00  deryni: Then your TERM is wrong.
14:00  acidjazz: set it to 256 in vimrc?
14:01  deryni: No. Fix your TERM setting.
14:01  acidjazz: myt term is Eterm
14:01  acidjazz: xterm-256color?
14:01  deryni: echo $TERM says Eterm?
14:01  acidjazz: yea
14:01  deryni: What does 'tput colors' say?
14:01  acidjazz: im n flxbox
14:01  acidjazz: fluxbox
14:01  acidjazz: k
14:01  acidjazz: 8
14:03  acidjazz: should it be 256?
14:03  deryni: The terminfo for Eterm should indicate 256 color support if it supports it, yes.
14:04  deryni: Does 'infocmp Eterm-256color' return a long list of things or an error?
14:04  acidjazz: couldnt open terminfpo file
14:04  acidjazz: let me look through /usr/share/terminfo/
14:04  acidjazz: theres othing in there
14:05  acidjazz: theres just /usr/terminfo/E/Eterm
14:06  deryni: What distro?
14:06  brotig: moep
14:06  acidjazz: ubuntu 10.10
14:06  deryni: Do you have the ncurses-term package installed?
14:07  acidjazz: checkign
14:08  acidjazz: negatory
14:08  acidjazz: installing
14:09  acidjazz: bingo
14:09  acidjazz: Eterm-256color is now available
14:09  acidjazz: whats weird though is w/ ETerm and going into vim i dont have that sweet font dropshadow eterm does normally
14:09  deryni: Not sure I know what you are talking about.
14:10  acidjazz: well ETerm normally does a trnasparent background w/ a dropshadow on the text in the window
14:10  acidjazz: and i see it fine
14:10  acidjazz: except entering vim w/ 256 colors
14:11  deryni: It stopped  once you set TERM to Eterm-256color?
14:12  acidjazz: entering vim
14:12  acidjazz: exiting vim its fine
14:12  acidjazz: only inside vim @ 256 w/ myterm set to that
14:12  deryni: I wonder if vim is setting a background color now that is getting in the way or something.
14:13  acidjazz: i think you're right
14:13  acidjazz: let me change schemes
14:15  acidjazz: yup
14:15  acidjazz: that did it
14:15  acidjazz: wheni chagne schemes the backgorund comes back
14:15  acidjazz: wonder if i remove ctermbg=16 in the color scheme file?
14:16  acidjazz: or all the guibg='s ?
14:16  RusAlex: hi guys, which plugin a good poing with html editing/highlighting and folding code in html files ?
14:17  tlonim: what is the plugin which can do what supertab does but automatically
14:17  acidjazz: yup ctermbg thing did it
14:17  tlonim: something like autocompl ?
14:17  tlonim: cant remember the name
14:19  acidjazz: cani do smethin like
14:19  acidjazz: in my .sh
14:19  acidjazz: if [ $TERM == 'Eterm'] then TERM='Eterm-256color' fi
14:21  deryni: You could. Though it might make more sense to see if you can configure Eterm to set that automatically.
14:26  Maahes: anyone know a text reading setup for vim?
14:29  sqz: can you define
14:29  sqz: text reading?
14:29  sqz: because i do that a lot..not sure what you mean
14:31  Maahes: hrrm, no toolbar visible, bookmarks (I think vim already has these but I haven't used them), centered headings would be nice but I don't know how feasible that is.
14:33  sqz: Maahes: ah you mean vim gui..sorry I only run vim in textmode
14:33  Maahes: or likewise is there an html browser mode?
14:33  Maahes: sqz: no, I mean in the terminal. I think this is possible to do with a profile
14:33  sqz: Maahes: may I ask what is the purpose behind this need?
14:34  sqz: because you mentioning a browser, almost looks like the ultimate answer :)
14:34  Maahes: sqz: I've been looking for a good set of console reading applications, and a console imageviewer. I found the image viewer. I had found a nice pdf viewer, but it turns out it only works in the linux console
14:35  Maahes: so now there's pdftohtml
14:35  Maahes: and well, I like the way netrik looks but not the way it acts, I'm not terribly fond of w3m, I like links2 but not the lack of vim keybindings =\
14:36  Nyoxi: I wonder what special features you need from your 'text reading' application and why isn't less enough
14:36  Nyoxi: bookmarks, hmm
14:39  Maahes: Nyoxi: not just that, less actually handles default page reading (long lines) better than most (my preferred pager), but both are pretty blech at how they handle it
14:39  sqz: hmmm I thought I was hardcore console user, but I havent reached the point that I'm really in need of an textmode browser (well lynx sometimes but thats it)
14:40  sqz: I wonder what I'm missing for not using w3m or netrik
14:40  Maahes: I don't like the visual \n inbetween words for wrapping
14:40  Maahes: er
14:40  Maahes: inside of words
14:41  sqz: Maahes: do you use a textmode browser very often?..and for what kind of sites do you use it?
14:41  sqz: is it textmode passion which lies underneath? or work-involved
14:41  sqz: sorry for being curious :)
14:43  Maahes: sqz: sites that aren't heavily ajaxed, online manuals are good, simple blogs, /., reddit (simple browsing). I'm also using a memory constrained system that sometimes goes haywire when I use too much of it, so opening a site in links2 (I'm trying to teach myself to like w3m, really), saves me some memory, if all I want to do is read something
14:45  Maahes: sqz: if it weren't for most, I'd be using w3m as my pager (yes it does that, and you can use it translate from html to text, and a bunch of other things) links2 just has a certain je ne sais quoi that I like about.
14:45  Maahes: and it has probably the lightest graphical browser around (links2 -g)
14:45  Maahes: you can set up w3m to display images inline the console as well
14:47  sqz: Maahes: ok respect
14:48  Maahes: sqz: I spend most of my time in my terminal, and prefer text based commands where something can be done tersely
14:48  Maahes: tui > gui wherever possible.
14:50  Maahes: so far I have calendar, todo, IM, multiplexor, imageviewer, lj/atom/wordpress client, pianobar (pandora.com) shellfm (lastfm), games (crawl, mille, sudoko) and various other headache easing utilities
14:50  Maahes: I haven't gotten around to playing with googlecli much yet.
14:51  Maahes: oh, and a note taker (as separate from a todo, i.e: like tomboy/gnote)
14:51  Maahes: txtreader actually does a lot of what I want but is a gui program that is a bit wonky
14:53  Maahes: I just read far enough today in most's manpage that is in fact possible to reconfigure its keybindings *sheepish*
14:53  seku: so terminal is like windowmanager for most. ;) And if you had a proper windowmanager with programs that have usable keyboard interface, you'd like them too.
14:53  Maahes: so now I can have vim bindings.
14:53  seku: +for you
14:54 --- blushade_ is now known as blushade
14:54  Maahes: seku: I used to use AwesomeWM for just that purpose, I can't easily set it up on my current system. I have gnome set up in a 3x3 grid of Virtual desktops and primarily use (starting from center) up-down-left-right for spacial organization
14:54  Maahes: whatever I am not running in tmux
14:55  seku: how about i3
14:55  Maahes: File browser (because I haven't compiled ranger fm yet) goes south, chromium goes north, other utilities go left and right.
14:56  Maahes: seku: awesomeWM is better than i3. I am just leery of messing with my gdm settings on this (I'm running of a USB drive) because if I hose it, I have to start from the begining again (well, I have dotfiles backed up).
14:56  sqz: btw. if anybody uses 'diff' on a regular basis to compare a local dirstructure vs a ftp dirstructure: checkout DirDiff.vim
14:57  Maahes: noice :)
14:57  sqz: you can do the same as diff, but you can start syncing files immediately within vim, and the diffing takes similar time as with a regular recursive 'diff'
14:59  Maahes: another neat tool I fairly recently discovered was: wtf.
14:59  Maahes: one line summary of what something *is*
15:03  sqz: Maahes: you mean wtf as a social tool? :)
15:05  Maahes: sqz: no, I like worsethanfailure too :) but wtf is an ancronym expander and one line summary of commands / programs
15:05  Maahes: so if you're searching through programs trying to find one obscurely named one you know starts with an s, instead of hitting man s<whatever> just do wtf s<whatever> takes much less time

15:17  mountained: doesnt work either
15:18  mountained: instead there is a path of a java file
15:18  Maahes: wordgrinder does the job of wrapping text nicely, and looking nice, just no vi keys =\ lemme see if it formats text nicely and then leaves it nicely formatted on export

16:15  alexandrov: if anyone can help pls tell me i am sorry i did not know this site
16:15  Scala: rsv: I recommend a macro
16:15  sqz: rsv: ow, you also have to move arrow down while you are moving the visual selection

16:16  rsv: how to repeat it
16:16  sqz: rsv: nono..
16:16  FernandoBasso: Do not even mention this word that starts with a and ends with w.
16:16  sqz: rsv: just do CTRL-V, and then press arrows left en down a bit
16:16  graywh: might be easier with :s
16:17  sqz: rsv: you will see a visual block appearing which covers multiple lines
16:17  sqz: rsv: then after you yield it with 'y', you can paste multiple lines with 'p'

16:32  Scala: How come there is no version of vim where anyone can contribute?
16:32  graywh: bram accepts patches
16:33  Silex: Scala: there's the vim mailing list
16:33  Scala: Oh?
16:33  Silex: but yeah basically I think vim's source is stuck in the 1990 world
16:34  Scala: Why hasn't anyone taken the liberty of modernizing it?
16:34  Silex: there's an mercurial/svn repo but apparently the normal route is to go through the mailing list
16:34  seku: is there a vim script which would add python docstring for a method and fill it field for description and args it takes, so one just needs to write descriptions
16:34  graywh: the mercurial repo is where you can get the latest source code
16:35  graywh: but, yes, patches are only accepted over the mailing list
16:35  Scala: There are always requests for new features, I feel like there should be a repo where anyone can work on these things since I feel like that's not very realistic right now
16:35  Silex: the other day I asked why they still used old c style declarations, and the answer was "to support very old compilers". I mean sure it's a good reason, but come on we're in 2010 now
16:36  mountained: im using eclim what complete plugin does it depends on?
16:36  mountained: and where do i set my ctags setting
16:36  Silex: I thought eclim didn't use ctags
16:36  mountained: does the taglist have sth to do with the code completion?
16:37  mountained: how do i deactivate the eclim code competion and use omni complete instead?
16:38  Silex: mountained: read the doc
16:38 * Silex wishes vim would be take the more modern route... it'd go from awesome to ZOMGincredible
16:39  Silex: I'm pretty sure simply moving to github would raise the number of contributors by a fair load
16:39  FernandoBasso: I heard people talking about rewriting vim.
16:40  singlecore: mountained, eclimd dont use ctags
16:40  Silex: I'd be interested in that
16:40  FernandoBasso: Of course, it would be an amazing long-time goal.

16:43  Silex: if for c++, and you're mostly after code completion, I suggest you take a look at clang_complete
16:44  mountained: singlecore, what steps i installed the plugin like its said in the readme
16:45  mountained: x o just works fine thx
16:45  mountained: i used x n instead

17:25  FernandoBasso: denny: Thank you very much.
17:25  industrial: ^
17:26  FernandoBasso: I can't believe this took over two hours...
17:26  sqz: gloomy__: I was almost afraid people were going to think I logged in twice, to feed this troll :)
17:26  guyzmo: hi
17:26  denny: FernandoBasso: sorry, I did come in a while back but alexandro or whatever he was called seemed to settle down with guidance from channel regulars
17:27  denny: we don't like to stomp in all heavy-handed, so I left it there and just lurked
17:27  gloomy__: sqz: hehe yeah :)
17:27  denny: then I was afk when that one started
17:27  FernandoBasso: denny: Don't be sorry. You saved the day anyway.
17:27  guyzmo: I'm trying to find out how can I prepend and append some text to a visual block selection... anyone knows ? (I'd like to make it as simple as a vmap)
17:27  peth: denny: same guy, hopped nicks
17:27  denny: I assumed as much
17:27  denny: I'm in and out, so if something kicks off again, highlight me and I'm more likely to notice
17:28  sqz: guyzmo: if you have selected more lines..just press I to insert to all lines
17:28  sqz: guyzmo: you will experience yourself typing on one line only first..but if you hit ESC (somekey) it will get inserted/appended to all lines
17:28  guyzmo: sqz - well, I'd like to insert a line before the first line and a line after the last line
17:29  tangledhelix: guyzmo: do you mean blank lines? or you want to insert something you've copied somewhere to a register previously...?
17:29  sqz: guyzmo: can it not be solved with a bit of 'i' (insert) and 'a' (append) after hitting escape?
17:29  guyzmo: tangledhelix - well, I want to insert a static string
17:30  gloomy__: guyzmo: you could record a macro
17:30  guyzmo: I mean foo\nbar\nfoobar\n -> XXX\nfoo\nbar\nfoobar\nXXX
17:30  guyzmo: gloomy__ - I want to store it in my vimrc
17:30  gloomy__: you can store macros in your vimrc I think.. sqz, didn't we do that before?
17:33  krz: just curious. i seem to always switch from one vertical buffer/window to the next using ctrl+w+wor ctrl+w+k. but i find it a bit slow since i have to press 3 keys. do you guys map this somewhere to make switching faster?
17:33  kurkale6ka: guyzmo: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3237
17:34  guyzmo: kurkale6ka - thanks
17:35  tangledhelix: krz: i have mapped e.g. ^j to :wincmd j<CR>, ^k to :wincmd k<CR>...
17:36  tangledhelix: so that ctrl + motion key = move to window in that direction
17:36  krz: hmmm
17:37  tangledhelix: krz: https://gist.github.com/750180
17:37  krz: tangledhelix: thanks will play around wit this
17:39  tangledhelix: guyzmo: that vimscript seems to prepend or append to each line? doesn't sound like what you were after? you can try somethign like this:
17:39  tangledhelix: :vnoremap <leader>x daFoo<CR>Bar<CR>Foo<CR>Baz<CR><ESC>kkkp
17:41  tangledhelix: (that will replace the current contents of your cut buffer.)
17:44  krz: is there anything wrong with this: :map <Leader>tm :CommandT app/models/<CR>
17:48  krz: ok nvm
17:50  FernandoBasso: I would like so much that terminals were able to change the cursor to a block shape to a thin bar shape in vim, when in insert mode, like gvim does.
17:51  Scala: FernandoBasso: Yeah, that would be nice
17:51  Scala: FernandoBasso: Though I customized my colorscheme to give a ugly bright red "-- INSERT --" at the bottom of my terminal when I'm in insert mode so I can see that out of the corner of my eye
17:52  kurkale6ka: FernandoBasso: you could use this if with konsole:     let &t_SI = "\<esc>]50;CursorShape=1\x7" | let &t_EI = "\<esc>]50;CursorShape=0\x7"
17:53  FernandoBasso: Scala: Nice. For one reason why I'd like that is because with a block, in normal mode, it is very clear what char you are *on*. And with a thin bar, it is very clear what chares the cursor is in *between*.
17:54  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: I use xterm, urxvt and gnome-terminal sometimes.
17:54  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Let me try it.
17:55  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Do you use KDE?
17:55  FernandoBasso: (just curious) I like to be 'informed' on what the cool vim users like more!
17:55  kurkale6ka: FernandoBasso: I used to and it used to work
17:56  kurkale6ka: I use gnome now
17:56  FernandoBasso: I run openbox. Let me see how many dependencies I'd have to install...
17:57  FernandoBasso: In the package kdebase-konsole. 45mb download and 192mb after installed...
17:57  kurkale6ka: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Change_cursor_shape_in_different_modes
17:57  Scala: FernandoBasso: Ouch
17:58  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Thanks.
17:58  kurkale6ka: FernandoBasso: there is a gnome-terminal procedure on that link
17:58  FernandoBasso: Oh. Change gconf for that, every time. haha. It is funny!
17:59  FernandoBasso: If it really works, okay.
17:59  lucasoman: of course, that only works when running vim locally
18:00  homekevin: Not much you can do for the non-local case, I think
18:00 --- WebDragon is now known as WebDragon|away
18:00  lucasoman: yes
18:00  FernandoBasso: It works! Cool!
18:00  homekevin: Unless maybe the TERMCAP environment variable can be exported to the remote side?
18:01  lucasoman: homekevin: it'd have to be the other way around
18:01  homekevin: ssh usually doesn't export variables though, I think.
18:01  lucasoman: remote vim would have to affect the local profile
18:02  homekevin: I'm not sure I follow, lucasoman
18:02  homekevin: You need the remote Vim to send special control sequences
18:02  homekevin: The control sequences are configured locally.
18:03  lucasoman: oohhh, i get what you're saying
18:03  lucasoman: sorry
18:03  homekevin: I'm really not at all sure it could even work, though.
18:03  homekevin: I don't know when TERMCAP is used.
18:04  homekevin: But I sure wish there was a TERMINFO variable to override particular capabilit
18:04  krz: tangledhelix: how do i make it so when i press ctrl+k or ctrl+j isntead of command?
18:04  homekevin: ...capabilities
18:04  FernandoBasso: What is the vim option for the cursor? I want to make it stop blinking.
18:05  homekevin: FernandoBasso: In a terminal? I don't think Vim can control that.
18:05  homekevin: There may be an option for the GUI, I'm not sure.
18:06  homekevin: Of course if your terminal supports turning off blinking you can probably make it work somehow.
18:06  kurkale6ka: :h cursor-blinking
18:06  krz: instead of pressing ctrl+w+w to get into the buffer/window below. how can i map the same functionality for ctrl+j ?
18:07  homekevin: krz: Sure.
18:07  homekevin: krz: Actually, CTRL-W w doesn't go below.
18:07  homekevin: CTRL-W j does that
18:07  krz: homekevin: yea. i just want it to be ctrl-j instead. how can i map this
18:08  homekevin: krz: Which part is the problem? CTRL-J is referred to as <C-J> in a mapping
18:08  krz: homekevin: how do i put this in my vimrc
18:08  krz: file
18:08  FernandoBasso: :set blinkon1
18:09  homekevin: So you'd do something like nnoremap <C-J> <C-W>j
18:09  FernandoBasso: :set blinkon0 <-- unknown option.
18:09  krz: homekevin: not map <silent> <C-j> :wincmd j<CR> ?
18:10  homekevin: I don't see why you'd need silent, and I don't know why you'd use a command-line version instead of a normal-mode version.
18:10  krz: ok so nmap <C-J> <C-W>j
18:10  homekevin: As for map Vs. nnoremap, I'd say you definitely want the 'n', and nore seems like a good idea.
18:11  homekevin: Without n the mapping would apply to visual and operator-pending modes, which seems nonsensical.
18:11  krz: ok let me try that
18:11  homekevin: Without the 'nore' other mappings could break this mapping.
18:12  krz: thanks for that homekevin
18:12  homekevin: No problem
18:14  homekevin: FernandoBasso: You need to read more carefully. The option is guicursor
18:14  FernandoBasso: homekevin: Oh. Thanks for letting me know. I admit I did not read with much care, and I read in a hurry. Sorry.
18:15  FernandoBasso: I am a little frustrated with my life today... Too many things to learn, only one life to live.
18:16  homekevin: Best to spend your time studying how to splice cat and human DNA. Best case: you get nine lives.
18:18  FernandoBasso: I don't think so...
18:18  mountained: omnicomplete works for standard java methods like System.out. etc but sometimes i get this error: "function javacomplete#Complete..<SNR>48_CompleteAfterWord..<SNR>48_DoGetFieldList":
18:19  FernandoBasso: Scala: Want to share your color scheme?
18:20  mountained: could it be that this plugin is not compatible with the newest vim version or with eclim?
18:21  FernandoBasso: In my case, I could not make eclim work with aptana studio 3 (beta).
18:22  mountained: but everything works fine except the code completion and that should be done with another plugin
18:23  FernandoBasso: Hmm. There is a :h termcap-cursor-shape. Let's see.

18:31 --- JusticeFries_ is now known as JusticeFries
18:32  mountained: i think it searches the source files in the wrong dir
18:36  ddollar: when i type esc+up i'm getting put into insert mode, and i cant seem to find which keymapping is doing that
18:37  Silex: ddollar: :nmap ?
18:38  mountained: the strange thing is that it completes my code sometimes despites the error
18:38  graywh: ddollar, you're starting in insert mode?
18:40  ddollar: graywh: when im in normal mode, typing esc+up puts me in insert mode and moves to the end of the line
18:40  graywh: why esc+up?
18:40  ddollar: no idea, it's really annoying and trying to remove it
18:40  graywh: does up by itself work?
18:40  ddollar: yeah
18:40  lucasoman: so it's "A" for some reason
18:40  graywh: how fast are you hitting those 2 keys?
18:41  ddollar: heh it only happens if i hit them fast together
18:41  graywh: sounds like maybe vim isn't detecting your up key escape sequence in this case
18:41  graywh: what's ttimeout set to?
18:41  graywh: ttimeoutlen
18:42  ddollar: -1
18:42  graywh: :echo &timeout &timeoutlen &ttimeout &ttimeoutlen
18:43  graywh: should print 4 numbers with space between
18:43  sleepynate: i forget, is there a convenient way to set a shell variable so I don't have to kill my session to load omnicomplete tags?
18:43  ddollar: 1 1000 1 -1
18:43  graywh: i recommend :set notimeout ttimeout ttimelen=100
18:43  graywh: see if that helps
18:44  graywh: and yes, i can reproduce your issue with default nocp settings
18:45  ddollar: is that supposed to be ttimeoutlen=100 ?
18:50  mountained: is there another possibility to gain some help according to the plugin? im trying to configure it for a week and still no sucess
18:52  ddollar: graywh: it looks like it may be tmux doing it, i cant get it to behave any differently even with low timeout values there but it works outside tmux
18:53  ddollar: thanks for the help
19:06  mountained: now it works! thx much for help. i dont know why but it works ;-)
19:08  jerojasro: mountained: that's why we're here :)
19:21  HardPhuck: is there a way to recode data in a file which is not utf-8
19:22  HardPhuck: the file is utf8, however
19:22 --- raorn_ is now known as raorn
19:23  HardPhuck: it's a dump of mysql database, which had latin2 data inserted
19:28  mountained: okey it works nearly perfect but if i type Sys fe it doesnt complete it to System, it does with classes inside my package but not with the native ones
19:28  etcetera: is anyone xmlvim.vim?
19:28  jerojasro: HardPhuck: dunno, but I suggest you use an external tool like csplit to split the file into chunks with the same encoding, and recode the ones you need using iconv
19:29  jerojasro: vimgor: ask
19:29  vimgor: You shouldn't ask for permission before asking a question. Just ask your question, and if some one can answer, they will.
19:29  jerojasro: etcetera: ^
19:29  etcetera: trying to figure out why 'f' doesn't work when folding a specific element.
19:29  etcetera: but using it from menu in gvim does.
19:29  jerojasro: HardPhuck: maybe you can even split the file with vim, if that doesn't trash the part of the file with the funny encoding
19:29  HardPhuck: hmmm
19:30  HardPhuck: why would i need to split it
19:30  jerojasro: etcetera: IIRC, the proper mapping (key shortcut) is \f
19:30  jerojasro: try it and report back please...
19:30  etcetera: jerojasro: works.
19:30  jerojasro: ok
19:30  etcetera: jerojasro: question is...why doesn't it tell me that in the menu like any other key binding.
19:31  etcetera: does '\' hold some other significance in vim key binding?
19:31  jerojasro: etcetera: dunno, I don't use menus. but, the docs do tell you all about the available mappings
19:33  jerojasro: etcetera: :help mapleader and :help localleader
19:33  rson: etcetera: \ is the default leader key
19:33  etcetera: heh.
19:33  jerojasro: your leader key is set to \, which is, IIRC, the default value for that setting
19:34  etcetera: so I've been using vim on and off for nearly 3 years now, constantly surprised by how obscure some of this stuff seems.
19:34  etcetera: and I just shrug it off :-)
19:34  etcetera: but, good to know. thanks guys.
19:34  jerojasro: HardPhuck: that's only a suggestion I'm doing. if you split your file in chunks that have the same encodning, it will be easy to convert them to the encoding you need using external tools (i.e., iconv)
19:41  HardPhuck: the file is utf but it contains latin1 character, now i don't know if there is a way just to convert the file itself and not the content ...
19:43 --- Silex is now known as silex
19:44  jerojasro: what do you mean by "the file itself"?
19:46  sleepynate: HardPhuck: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Forcing_UTF-8_Vim_to_read_Latin1_as_Latin1
19:46  HardPhuck: well how does some program determine encoding? does it go thru all characters or is there some information on the file
19:48  HardPhuck: sleepynate: thx
19:49  jerojasro: HardPhuck: in most cases, programs use heuristics to guess which is the encoding of the file. with plain text, you can never know for sure
19:49  jerojasro: there are some conventions regarding how to indicate the encoding of a file, but  they are just that
19:49  jerojasro: conventions
19:49  jerojasro: welcome to the real world, where there is no such thing as plain text
19:54  MissingNo-: would anyone know why vim can't find eg ^fg(#FFFFFF) using search pattern \^fg\(#.{6}\) ?
19:54  MissingNo-: it seems to work in normal grep

22:13  sako: hey guys is there a plugin to change the working directory to NERDTree project root?
22:13  sako: anyone know?
22:13  FernandoBasso: cd %:p:h ?
22:15  FernandoBasso: nnoremap cd :cd %:p:h<CR>:pwd<CR>
22:15  sako: hmm thats interesting.
22:15  sako: FernandoBasso: i want to understand what that does ;P
22:15  sako: whats %:p:h do?
22:16  deryni: :help expand(
22:16  FernandoBasso: sako: When you open NERDTree and navigate with it to dir, vim stays where it started, doesn't it?
22:16  sako: ya
22:17  Scala_: FernandoBasso: Do you still want my colorscheme?
22:17  sako: Scala_: can i see your colorscheme?
22:17  FernandoBasso:  %:p:h simply cd to the dir where the current file in the current buffer is.
22:17  sako: i been using jellybeans for a while now :)
22:17  sako: FernandoBasso: ah great!
22:17  Scala_: let me upload a pic...
22:17  FernandoBasso: Scala_: I sure want. I had to leave. Now, I'll stay here a bit.
22:18  sako: so nnoremap cd
22:18  sako: maps all that to cd?
22:18  Scala_: Sorry, I'm not going to bother cropping :P
22:18  Scala_: http://i.imgur.com/iZhIf.png
22:18  FernandoBasso: sako: And that mapping makes easy to change to the path where the current file on the buffer is.
22:18  FernandoBasso: In normal mode, a simple cd will change to that dir.
22:18  nordin_: hello guys, what is recommended arguments to configure for installing 7.3, if I want to benenfit from plugin and exuberant ctags?
22:19  sako: nice!
22:19  sako: thanks FernandoBasso
22:19  Scala_: It's really just a slightly modified desert256 :P
22:19  sleepynate: Scala_: funny, i'm working with django right now too
22:19  FernandoBasso: sako: Actually, I learned that from someone else.
22:19  Scala_: sleepynate: nice
22:20  nordin_: cause I've seen some plugins saying that I need to install vim with some arguments...
22:20  sako: Scala_: nice theme, are you using a window manager
22:20  sleepynate: Scala_: hahaha
22:20  Scala_: sako: That's byobu, which is pretty much super-screen
22:20  sleepynate: sako: that's gnome, yo
22:20  sleepynate: ~_^
22:20  walt: that scheme is terrible :/
22:20  Scala_: walt: To each his own, heheh
22:21  nordin_: like for example vimgrep...
22:21  walt: I have tried switching from my modified wombat many times. I always go back
22:21  sleepynate: sako: oh are you taking about his multiplexer?
22:23 --- sh1m is now known as sh1mmer
22:23  Scala_: walt: Wombat's too blue :P
22:24  Scala_: and yellow
22:24  Scala_: heh not my cup of tea
22:24  FernandoBasso: I like desert, darkZ, motus, ir_black, etc. I still don't have a preferred one.
22:24  walt: hm, I dont think it's very blue. More green
22:24  walt: well, green/yeallow
22:24  walt: yeah
22:25  bairui: nordin_: I would imagine a vanilla Vim install would be sufficient for that.
22:25  FernandoBasso: Have you guys ever used terminator (especially with vim) ?
22:26  nordin_: bairui: I've seen the word vanilla used a lot, does it mean a standard install?
22:26  Scala_: nordin_: yeah.
22:27  bairui: yep
22:27  nordin_: ok, learnt something
22:27  walt: nordin_: just try installing your plugins, and if it doesnt work, deal with it.
22:27  mgedmin: http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/v/vanilla.html
22:28  homekevin: Even vim.basic in Debian is configured with HUGE
22:28  nordin_: and for cscope support? cscope says vim shoudl be compiled with --enable-enable
22:28  nordin_: --enable-cscope
22:28  homekevin: You have to enable enable first, otherwise enable cscope won't work.
22:28  nordin_: I guess it won't harm to do that, right?
22:29  bairui: no harm
22:29  nordin_: ok thnx
22:29  nordin_: thnx you all
22:29  bairui: np from all :)
22:35  sako: FernandoBasso: last question i promise.. do i jsut put nnoremap cd :cd %:p:h<CR>:pwd<CR> in my .vimrc like that?
22:35  sako: i dont have to do set or anything?
22:36  FernandoBasso: Just that. Restart vim, open a 'far away' file, and in normal mode *cd* with change to the path of the open file.
22:37  FernandoBasso: Just a moment.

22:47  sako: oh wait a minute
22:47  sako: im using macvim
22:47  sako: on osx...
22:47  bairui: FernandoBasso: it is, but that is considered poor form here, so let's just pretend that was a typo :)
22:48 --- Channel #vim was synced in 72 seconds
22:48  FernandoBasso: :)
22:48  sako: nnoremap cd :lcd %:h<cr>:pwd<cr>
22:49  sako: thats what i added to my vimrc
22:49  bairui: sako: that shouldn't matter. I think the mac guys can get :cd and :lcd working. :)   So, try manually first. Go to your first tab and type  :lcd /tmp  and then your second and type   :lcd ~
22:50  zeltak: hya stupid
22:50  sako: bairui: ok that works ;)
22:50  zeltak: question i cant find an answer to
22:50  zeltak: sorry about the enter :)
22:50  zeltak: how do i map vv to go to last line (like gg goes to first line)
22:51  zeltak: i tried this: map vv  <Esc>:lastline<CR> but it didnt work
22:51  bairui: sako: cool... so, why doesn't the map work? What does   :map cd   say?
22:51  FernandoBasso: No, because when you first type v it triggers visual mode.
22:51  sako: bairui: hmm actually
22:51  bairui: zeltak: :map vv G
22:51  sako: bairui: it seems like the map doesnt work with nerdtree in different tabs?
22:52  sako: it considers the NERDTree the same buffer or something?
22:52  bairui: sako: dunno... not an NT user, sorry.
22:52  spiiph: bairui, isn't it better to tell him to use G in the first place!? :D
22:52  spiiph: Remapping vv seems excessively silly.
22:52  bairui: spiiph: you point this end at your foot and you pull this little lever here... :)
22:52  FernandoBasso: sako: It is an unlisted buffer.
22:52  spiiph: bairui, hahahaha
22:53  FernandoBasso: spiiph: Good catch!
22:53  sako: FernandoBasso: i see, so no way to use :lcd with different NERDTree instances?
22:53  bairui: :)
22:53  zeltak: bairui: sweet so simple :)
22:53  zeltak: thx man
22:53  bairui: np
22:54  FernandoBasso: sako: I don't know. I prefer so :mksessions on projects, and then :source /path/to/my_sessions/secret_project.vim and I am all set.
22:55  FernandoBasso: sako: :help 21.4 and then, help views-sessions
22:56  homekevin: Hm, so FernandoBasso is working on a secret project. Interesting...
22:57  homekevin: Didn't mean to let the slip out, did you?
22:57  FernandoBasso: If I tell more, I shall die.
23:00  homekevin: No need, the ninjas have already been deployed to retrieve the schematics and terminate the participants if necessary.
23:01  bairui: it's always necessary
23:01  FernandoBasso: Master yoda taught me the ways of the force. Don't make me destroy the ninjas. Keep them out of my way.
23:01  sako: FernandoBasso: interesting..
23:02  sako: anyone have a solution for doing a "project-wide" search
23:02  sako: that's my reason for this whole cd-ing into directories.. i use Ack
23:02  alester: ack can take a directory to search
23:02  sako: hmmm i see
23:02  alester: ack my_function ~/sourcedir/whatever
23:02  sako: so pass the directory instead
23:03  sako: interesting
23:03  sako: thanks alester
23:03  alester: You're wecome.
23:03  alester: It just happens to assume . for the directory because that's the most common.
23:03  alester: Every time you don't have to type " ." that's a win. :-)
23:03  alester: A small one, to be sure, but still a win.
23:05  mgedmin: I find it very convenient to keep my current working dir at the project root
23:05  mgedmin: :e with relative pathnames, project-wide search etc.
23:08  sako: mgedmin: do you use NT?
23:09  mgedmin: what's NT?
23:09  mgedmin: nerdtree or the ancient Windows version?
23:10  sako: nerdtree ;)
23:12  FernandoBasso: sako: I use two lines in vimrc, to make it easier to save and restore sessions. nnoremap <LocalLeader>p :source ~/.vim/vim_sessions/ --- nnoremap <LocalLeader>ç :mksession! ~/.vim/vim_sessions/
23:12 * mgedmin tried nerdtree, couldn't get into an agreement with it
23:13  FernandoBasso: Me either.
23:13  mgedmin: what was it...? oh, I think it redefined :E and made it act all different
23:13  mgedmin: when I was busy and had no time for patient relearning/change of habits
23:14  FernandoBasso: sako: p stands for project. ç just happen to be an available key I have my keyboard.
23:16  FernandoBasso: I couldn't make NERDTree open bookmarked directories.
23:25  sako: hmm i am not totally committed to NERDTree... i am going to try your method FernandoBasso
23:25  sako: FernandoBasso: so what exactly does that do? just saves project sessions?
23:26  sako: can i see an example of one of your sessions if you dont mind? just curious on what exactly it saves
23:27  FernandoBasso: sako: those lines do nothing more thant get almost done saving/sourcing your sessions. It leaves you just about to type the name of the session to save/open.
23:27  FernandoBasso: My session will not work for you, since my path and files are not the same as in your system.
23:28  FernandoBasso: sako: To make a test, simply open two or three files, and do :mksession /path/to/my_sessions/my_project.vim
23:28  sako: FernandoBasso: oh sorry i meant a screenshot*
23:28  FernandoBasso: Okay.
23:32  sako: FernandoBasso: just curious what is the "standard" localleader?
23:32  FernandoBasso: The standard is \
23:33  sako: have you changed yours? and also why is , frowned upon :P
23:33  mgedmin: , is a useful movement
23:33  mgedmin: ... well, that's overstating the case a bit
23:34 * mgedmin has no qualms mapping ,x for various values of x
23:35  FernandoBasso: I chagned to _
23:35  mgedmin: (which is also a movement ;)
23:36  bairui: on my keyboard,   ,   is right under my fingers, but   \   is way up on the right side, just next to <Backspace>. I need a packed-lunch just to get there!
23:37  bairui: so, I sacrificed the terribly useful</sarcasm> default movement of   ,   and reenlisted him as <Leader>.  Now stand back, everyone, the gods strike hard when displeased.   *cringe*      ;)
23:37  FernandoBasso: sako: http://metabox.it/Q7pIh Not interesting, if is what you wanted to see.
23:38  FernandoBasso: That bug is annoying.
23:38  ceej: hey, how is it possible for some vim plugins to add lines that when I do an undo they still stay there?
23:38  FernandoBasso: I forget I have to start gvim with --nofork
23:39  bairui: ceej: undo undoes atomic operations. If the plugin does several, you'll need to undo several times.
23:39  mgedmin: (unless the plugin takes care to use :undojoin properly)
23:39  ceej: bairui: I've done that all the way to the beginning yet it stays there
23:40  bairui: out, damn stain!
23:40  mgedmin: ceej, switching between buffers wipes the undo list, if you don't have 'hidden' enabled
23:40  mgedmin: also, reloading the file content with :e wipes the undo list, unless you have vim 7.3 with persistent undo enabled
23:41  bairui: gosh, look at the time! Work beckons. :( Later, lads.
23:41  ceej: mgedmin: I have 7.3 with persistent undo....
23:41  ceej: 'hidden' enabled ?
23:42  FernandoBasso: I  found the new relativnumber option funny.
23:44  fow: funny? how so? I personally love it
23:45  mgedmin: FernandoBasso, what theme and what font is that in your screenshot?
23:45  sako: FernandoBasso: thats nice.. so i can save the state of all windows/buffers in sessions?
23:45  sako: i like that more than nerdtree ;)
23:45  sako: also saves the cwd?
23:46  mgedmin: sako, check out :h 'sessionoptions' -- what they save is configurable
23:46  sako: niceee
23:46  mgedmin: curdir is saved by default, I see
23:46  sako: thanks a lot guys
23:47  FernandoBasso: mgedmin: the colorscheme is desert, I just changed the background, I think. The font is 'Dejavu Sans Mono'. I like it because it makes clear the difference between 0 O L l 1 : ;
23:47  mgedmin: hm, must be a different renderer used on mac os x
23:47  mgedmin: or maybe just a different pixel size
23:47  mgedmin: mac screenshots always look so pretty
23:48  sako: how would i check if there is already a <LocalLeader> button?
23:48  sako: i dont want things to conflict
23:48  FernandoBasso: I only have problems with vim not restoring help files. Either I have to :set buflisted first, or edit the session file, and delete an if statement the wipes out the unlisted buffers.
23:49  FernandoBasso: mgedmin: You found the fonts not looking good?
23:49  mgedmin: I use dejavu sans mono
23:50  FernandoBasso: I am not on mac.
23:50  FernandoBasso: Are you?
23:50  mgedmin: no?
23:50 * mgedmin is on ubuntu
23:50  FernandoBasso: No. Arch linux.
23:50  mgedmin: he
23:50  homekevin: I use Arch Ubuntu
23:50  mgedmin: oh, right, the three buttons are on the right side
23:50  homekevin: GNU/Ubuntu
