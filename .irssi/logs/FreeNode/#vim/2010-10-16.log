11:58  depaulis: DHulme: Hmm... I have been thinking of what vim use as namespace separator, the example above was just to illustrate, there is Files that not using _. But I will write a note and take a look at this later anyway. Thanks

12:05  depaulis: Aha ;) Okay, missunderstood you then. Anyway something that I have wondered about is how Vim define a <word>. let say I press 'e' standing on 'this_is_a_word'. What I wondering about is what Vim consider as nameseparators.

12:07  DHulme: that's set by 'iskeyword'
12:09  depaulis: Aha.. Then I can stop wondering ;)
