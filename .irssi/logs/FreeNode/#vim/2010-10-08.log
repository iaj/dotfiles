02:37  diegoviola: r4tune: it would be cool if the guy uses some kind of snippets instead of typing the whole tags though :)
02:39  r4tune: i'd have sat there like a dummy and done it with a regexp
02:39 * r4tune really must play with recording more
02:41  r4tune: what would be really elite is to have like the top emacs editor and the top vi editor (people) on a youtube faceoff doing annoying tedious tasks to those of us who don't know how with magic commands that make OS X people wonder if paying 2.5k for textmate was worth it
02:42  r4tune: all different languages, repetitive tasks hard to do with a "notepad" or similar, like a buffer each of them
02:42  r4tune: race to the finish

02:46  guns_: lol 2.5k; 40 euros isn't much for a working programmer. Anyway, my gf is finding TextMate much more approachable than vim.

10:03  Araxia: iaj: that is just going to be alphabetical. you could get more precision with a :cabb, or use :command-completion-custom to create your own completion facility *for* a function.

10:21  ab3: hoi
10:23  ab3: when I type <tab> after a '.' vim freezes, I have pydiction and snipmates (remapped to c-j) installed. Any idea what may cause this problem
10:25  Raimondi: ab3: :verbose imap <tab>
10:28  ab3: this is what i get: http://dpaste.com/254901/
10:30  Raimondi: I supose the ftplugin is local to the buffer, so it takes precedence over the global mapping of snipMate.
10:30  Raimondi: s/ftplugin/ftplugin mapping/
10:32  ab3: ok I don't understand why it is still using tab for snipmate since I remapped it: http://dpaste.com/254904/

10:44  theadmin: Is there a way to get vim-like stuff for OpenOffice?
10:45  _joey: thanks
10:46  _joey: and then quickest way to navigate between buffers?
10:46  _joey: another question: in latex-suite I need to hit \ll to compile the source and it appears vim doesn't recognize '\' character
10:47  theadmin: _joey: I'm not sure what you mean but \ is the escape-char so you'll probably nead to type \\
10:47  _joey: never mind
10:47  _joey: I fixed the problem
10:48  _joey: when the source is compiled vim does nothing
10:49  theadmin: _joey: Ah, indeed - it just hangs
11:02  theadmin: So any vim-like plugin for OpenOffice? There is one for Microsoft's but meh.
11:04  jink: So, after each occurrence of a certain something, I'd like to add another line with a fixed content.  I know there's something like :g but I forgot what I have to do. :)
11:05  jink: I could do :%s/// of course, and use & and a newline, but that doesn't feel right. :)

11:19  _joey: for gvim to get Courier New size 12 fonts
11:19  _joey: It is not loaded. What am I doing wrong?

11:26  _joey: theadmin: it doesn't work
11:27  theadmin: _joey: Hm, well, let me try with teh .vimrc - I only tried trough the :set command so far
11:27  _joey: that's on ms windows
11:27  _joey: and it's in .vimrc
11:28  thkoehler: shouldn't that be _vimrc on windows?

12:38  spiiph: _joey, I'd recommend a proper tetris game instead.

12:50  mgedmin: silasdavis, ^
12:50  _joey: or just 0
12:50  mgedmin: "begginning of the first word"
12:51  mgedmin: 0 always jumps to the beginning of the line, which may have a few spaces/tabs in front of the word
12:51  _joey: yes

12:54  silasdavis: Silex: that works, thanks
12:55  spiiph: silasdavis, if it's visual_studio.vim you're talking about, it doesn't remap ^, _ or 0
12:55  Silex: _joey: fuzzyfinder, autoalign
12:55  spiiph: Also, I find _ to be a better alternative than ^
12:55  silasdavis: spiiph: no, it's VsVim

13:00  MightyFoo: i've got marker folding already in my source (and want to keep it). but i'll fiddle with some syntax fold-method
13:00  spiiph: If there are only two, :only or <C-w>o
13:00  MightyFoo: so i'm going to go with fold-method=syntax and add syntax matches for my {{{ }}} markers
13:01  _joey: thanks

13:17  ErsatzRyan: how can i align cucumber tables in vim?
13:18  Silex: ErsatzRyan: maybe with a macro?
13:20  ErsatzRyan: i'm pretty new to vim, i can use it and a lot of the tricks but i'm not sure that i'm ready for extending it....
13:20  Dad`: hello :) how can I specify the "space-size" between two lines ? I tried to use proggy font but it looks weird
13:20  Silex: well, macros are part of standard vim
13:21  Silex: ErsatzRyan: basically, you record a set of actions to be done and you can replay them later. So for example if you need to align 300 lines in a row doing the same keystroke, just record it for one line and repeat it on the 299 others
13:23  mgedmin: Dad`, :h 'linespace', perhaps
13:23  mgedmin: ErsatzRyan, there's a plugin Align.vim, IIRC
13:24  Dad`: mgedmin: thx!
13:24  spiiph: Align.vim is horrible. :(
13:24  spiiph: godlygeek's Tabular.vim is better
13:25  rson: i'm curious, how do people using pathogen fall back when pathogen fails?  i currently have a try/catch around the pathogen load plugins statement, then manually add to the rtp paths to any plugins that work for vim < 7.  am i missing something with pathogen or is this the simplest way?
13:25  rson: fails because vim < 700 *
13:26 * mgedmin still hasn't made a switch to pathogen, but thinks he has vim 7 on all his machines
13:26  fgro: when in :Explorer, is there a shortcut to open a file in a new tab and leave the explorer open?
13:27  mgedmin: fgro, 'o', I think
13:27  rson: mgedmin: i'm thinking about making the jump.  i was manually setting rtp for all my scripts until yesterday when i tried out pathogen but then i lose the control that i once had of loading only scripts that will work for that version
13:27  rson: mgedmin: we've got vim 6 or some of our servers :(
13:27  fgro: mgedmin: nope, that just splits window
13:28 * mgedmin finds 6.4 on one of his servers -- yay ubuntu dapper
13:28  mgedmin: fgro, sorry, didn't notice you said "tab"
13:28  mgedmin: have you tried looking for keys in :help netrw?
13:28  mgedmin: tab-equivalent of 'gf' might also work

13:55  jrib: kjelle: C-@   seems to work for me.  Wouldn't S-Space involve Shift?
13:56  kjelle: jrib: i see CTRL+k then the combination (my ctrl+space) then CTRL+k => gives me <8b>
13:56  kjelle: jrib: my shell/console might send something different
13:56  kjelle: jrib: hmm
13:57  kjelle: ah, it sends <Nul>
13:57  kjelle: it seems disabled then, perhaps? (i did c-space)
13:58  kjelle: there we go
13:58  kjelle: imap <Nul> <c-x><c-o> did it
13:58  mgedmin: <C-Space> is the same as <C-@> or <C-_> here -- an ASCII NUL
13:58  kjelle: mm
13:58  kjelle: ok
13:58  kjelle: i can try with C-2
13:58  kjelle: c-@
13:59  kjelle: mm, works

14:01 * mgedmin hates how Ctrl-$ is the same as Ctrl-\ and means "kill the application with extreme prejudice by sending SIGQUIT" -- Ctrl-$ is sooo close to Shift-$...
14:05  et: where does it mean that?
14:05  et: and shift-$ is basically just $?
14:10  mgedmin: yes: $ in mutt means "save and quit", ctrl-$ in all the terminal emulators I've seen means "kill the running application uncleanly"

15:23  FernandoBasso: Or you mean, when typing?
15:24  alberto2000: FernandoBasso: i created a file with another editor, saved in with that other editor, opened it with vim, and vim only shows garbled characters
15:25  FernandoBasso: alberto2000: There must be a conflict between the encoding from the other editor and vim.

15:25  Prototype0: Restarting vim seems to have done it
15:25  Prototype0: But is there another way?
15:25  FernandoBasso: alberto2000: try (as someone had mentioned earlier) :w ++enc=utf-8
15:26  mgedmin: alberto2000, do you know what encoding that file is in, now?
15:26  mgedmin: you may need to :e ++enc=utf-8, or set 'fileencodings' (plural) accordingly to let vim autodetect

15:30  _joey: for example, when the cursor moves
15:32  rudi_s: vimgor: enc
15:32  vimgor: Vim has multiple settings for encodings: 'encoding' sets Vim's internal encoding (should be utf-8), 'fileencoding' sets the encoding of a file, 'fileencodings' (s) are encodings tried when opening a file. If Vim doesn't detect the encoding correctly, use :e ++enc=encoding filename to force the given encoding. If possible try it in GVim or terminal encoding problems might interfere.

15:35  _joey: what will be slow?
15:35  rudi_s: _joey: Saving so often.
15:36  rudi_s: Maybe use CursorHold or CursorHoldI
15:36  _joey: what does that achieves?
15:36  rudi_s: _joey: :h CursorHold
15:36  _joey: hold on
15:37  _joey: I think CursorMoved is a better choice
15:38  rudi_s: _joey: To quote the docs: "Careful: Don't do anything that the user does not expect or that is slow."
15:38  rudi_s: I'm sure how quick update is, testing will tell.
15:38  rudi_s: Anyway, saving so often seems a little excessive to me.
15:39  _joey: how would implement continous viewing ?
15:40  _joey: we have LaTeX source and would like to preview pdf as we modify the source
15:40  rudi_s: _joey: To be honest, I wouldn't. Save and preview when you're done (with whatever you're trying to do) sounds better to me.
15:41  spiiph: _joey, implement it as a stand-alone process instead.
15:42  _joey: numerous packages such preview-latex on emacs and various WYSIWYG packages offer this
15:42  _joey: vim's latexsuite doesn't

15:42  vimgor: An slightly-maintained, buggy, over-complicated plugin intended to make it easier to author (La)Tex files. Often, this is better served by using a standalone snippets plugin (like snipMate) to define the snippets you actually find useful as well as using the command ':compiler tex' to allow using Vim's quickfix feature when compiling TeX to an output format.
15:42  rudi_s: _joey: ^
15:42  _joey: people write their own Makefiles and shell scripts to implement it
15:43  rudi_s: _joey: I don't understand why you need a continous preview, isn't a preview when you're finished with a section enough?
15:43  rudi_s: That's what CursorHold or BufWrite would accomplish.
15:43  _joey: I am not going to explain it to you
15:43  _joey: if you don't understand it
15:44  _joey: you write and then you need to interupt to compile and see, for example, whe n  you are creating a table
15:44  _joey: it's better to see the output in real time
15:44  _joey: hence, this feature is popular in many packages
15:44  rudi_s: Sure, you don't have to. Just thinking it's not useful, if you know LaTeX, there's IMHO no need to reparse it every second. I gave you examples how to do it, you can even use CursorMove if you have to.
15:45  _joey: It's not a C or Java program. It's typesetting
15:45  rudi_s: But while you're working you're file will often be in an invalid state, calling pdflatex on that seems a waste to me, but YMMV.
15:45  rudi_s: *your
15:47  wanderley: hello, how I highlighting double-quoted strings?
15:47  _joey: well, it may be  excessive
15:48  _joey: I may try autosave every 30 seconds
15:48  _joey: I'd see what will work better
15:48  alberto2000: anyone: im on macosx, i dont seem to have any .vimrc file in my home folder... must i create it?
15:48  wanderley: alberto2000: yes.
15:48  alberto2000: wanderley: thx
15:49  rudi_s: wanderley: Any specific language or in generla?
15:49  rudi_s: *general
15:51  wanderley: I'm using cucumber.
15:51  wanderley: It's a simple text
15:51  wanderley:     Quando clico em "Visualizar informações do cliente" em "menu_actions"
15:51  wanderley: I want to higlight "Visualizar informações do cliente" and "menu_actions"
15:51  rudi_s: wanderley: What is cucumber?
15:52  wanderley: It's testing framework.
15:52  wanderley: rudi_s: My file is a simple text.
15:52  rudi_s: wanderley: Ok. :h syn-region
15:53  rudi_s: :syntax region MatchNameHere start='"' end='"' should work
15:53  rudi_s: Where MatchNameHere is the group you want to hilight it with, like TODO.
15:54  rudi_s: Then add that to a syntax file and use it for your text files.
15:56 --- jtrucks_ is now known as jtrucks
16:01  _joey: okay, manually saving :w is good enough for a preview
16:01  rudi_s: ;-)
16:03  _joey: someone needs to implement something similar to preview-latex bundles with auctex
16:03  _joey: :)
16:04  _joey: there are so many add-ons and scripts and hacks for live preview
16:04  _joey: and I've seen people switching to emacs using their viper mode just for the sake of having better latex support
16:05  spiiph: That sounds contra-productive
16:06  _joey: what is?
16:06  spiiph: Switchin to emacs and viper mode just to get better latex support
16:06  spiiph: If you're going to use emacs, you might as well use emacs, and not pretend you're using vi/vim.
16:07  _joey: well, the priority is for latex support. It gets very difficult and when you write large volumes
16:07  _joey: auctex is very good, but then again, people are used to vim editing
16:08  _joey: normal moving, copy, past, switching between buffers etc
16:10  spiiph: I don't believe that the benefits of acutex outweighs the inferior editing capabilities. ;)
16:13  _joey: let me give an example. I will write inline complex math equation. Obviously, I would like to preview it. Currently, the who document needs be recompile (authors subdivided documents in chapters etc) but still, you will need to recompile the document. However, with preview-latex which is part of auctex you just hit c-c c-p c-p and there you have the equation sitting in the buffer in the place where you place. You can do this for environment, sections, buffers etc
16:13  _joey: there are so many cool features
16:14  _joey: in that package
16:16  mgedmin: I had a couple of macros when I used to work with latex
16:16  mgedmin: one key would save, rebuild the .dvi, and ping a running xdvi to reload it
16:17  _joey: i've got latexmk doing live preview. Almost live
16:17  mgedmin: I think I had a key where I could focus xdvi to the paragraph I was sitting on in vim, thanks to -src-specials
16:17  mgedmin: and I had some way to do the reverse
16:17  _joey: each time you preview it, the comilier runs on entire .tex file
16:18  _joey: to do the reverse?
16:18  mgedmin: position the cursor in vim to the place I clicked on in xdvi
16:19  _joey: okay
16:19  mgedmin: xdvi has an -editor option for that
16:22  mgedmin: and a -sourceposition option for the first thing (finding the rendered version from source filename + line number)
16:22  _joey: If I could I would write something similar to auctex on vim
16:22  _joey: :)
16:30  Prototype0: Is there any way to make a match skip an area? Like, I want to match /(\_.\{-})/ unless ')' appears betweeen " "
16:31  Prototype0: Though it has to be a match
16:31  spiiph: That's difficult.
16:31  spiiph: Since regular expressions are, well, regular.
16:32  mgedmin: I'll try
16:33  Prototype0: This would be easy if it were a region, but I think it would have to be a match.
16:33  mgedmin: /(\("[^"]*"\}\|\_[^")]\)*)/
16:33  mattyb: Does anyone know how to switch the contents of two tabs?
16:33  mgedmin: modulo any errors I've introduced
16:34  spiiph: mattyb, :tabmove, but why would you want to?
16:34  mattyb: I closed a tab by accident, and want it back where it was. :tabe stuff opens it to the right.
16:35  mattyb: Sweet thanks.
16:35  mattyb: vim > *
16:49  PelleTut: I added this to my vimrc for haskell files:  au BufEnter *.hs compiler ghc. However now I just get this error message when I try to open a .hs file: Error detected while processing BufEnter Auto commands for "*.hs":E666: compiler not supported: ghc
16:49  PelleTut: I don't understand this, ghc compiler not supported?
16:49  spiiph: PelleTut, you're lacking compiler/ghc.vim
16:50  graywh: you misunderstand what :compiler does
16:50  spiiph: PelleTut, it's not included in the original distribution at least.
16:50  PelleTut: ahh, ok, that makes more sense
