08:49  marlun: After creating a new window/buffer with "new", can I disable/remove all mappings for only that buffer?
08:55  gniourf_gniourf: hi here. When I use :! man something I get the annoying message "WARNING: terminal is not fully functional". The command :! echo $TERM replies "dumb" (so yes, terminal is not fully functional). How can I change this? Thanks

09:06  etherealite: Hey. Anyone know of a good way to get vim keybindings without using vimperator in suck ass firefox?
09:07  etherealite: Also why does firefox get so godamn slow!

10:00  iaj: When you guys are using windows and close them.. do you stick to close the whole buffer :bd or just <C-W>d ?
10:06  frogonwheels: iaj: :q  does it for me
10:07  iaj: frogonwheels: will :q close the buffer as well?
10:07  iaj: think so ;)
10:18  d0ugal: I've got a fairly nooby question I'm afraid. I'm using the ach plugin, after doung :Ack <pattern> and so on, how do I close the split at the bottom that the ack results are in?
10:20  d0ugal: nevermind, got it
10:23  Silex: snipmate <3
10:24  iaj: hmm is there any way to do :n but close the current viewed file?
10:27  Silex: :bd | n
10:27  Silex: </guess>
10:28  Silex: wait, :bd is enough lol
10:28  Silex: as it'll go to the next file
10:28  iaj: hmmm what if I had files open previously and just want to go through the arglist
10:28  iaj: I have to :bd | n then
10:29  iaj: thought there's a command for it
10:33  Silex: iaj: maybe there is, I'm a vim beginner
10:39  iaj: Silex: heh..yeah... just couldn't find something in the help :-). Thanks anyway!

11:53  KeeperOfTheSoul_: is there away to change gvim to look for its rc files in a different folder by default?
11:54  KeeperOfTheSoul_: and vim for that matter
11:54  masak: yesterday, with the kind help of #vim, I successfully rebound the arrow keys to <Nop>. is there a way to do the same for the arrow keys in insert mode?
11:54  KeeperOfTheSoul_: masak: I assume you used nmap or nnoremap ?
11:55  masak: KeeperOfTheSoul_: I used ':map'
11:55  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah right, so just missing :imap
11:55  masak: great; thanks.
11:55  KeeperOfTheSoul_: or probably map!
11:55  KeeperOfTheSoul_: masak: :h map-modes
11:56  masak: thank you.
12:01  KeeperOfTheSoul_: how do I get vim to look for ~/.vim/.vimrc rather than ~/.vimrc ?
12:03  iaj: does anyone know how I can add a PATH for executing shell commands in MacVim?
12:03  deryni: Make .~/vimrc source it. =)
12:03  KeeperOfTheSoul_: I was just wondering if there was a simple environment variable I could set that would change where vim/gvim looks
12:04  KeeperOfTheSoul_: tried symlinks but that doesn't sit well with the temp/delete/move method of saving :)
12:05  deryni: Depends on what you are editing and what you are editing it with, but true.
12:07  deryni: Looks like -u and/or VIMINIT might be usable for this.
12:07  KeeperOfTheSoul_: want to avoid startup flags really, since that is more annoying to use
12:08  iaj: well you could just put an alias to your bashrc that it always executes the startup flag automatically when you type 'v' for example.
12:08  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah, using windows here
12:09  deryni: The shortcut can get the flag too, but that's neither here nor there really.
12:09  zomg: Why don't you just add source $HOME/.vim/.vimrc (or something like that) to the system wide vimrc?
12:09  zomg: That should work on Windows too
12:10  KeeperOfTheSoul_: yeah, seems to be the simplest way
12:10  KeeperOfTheSoul_: thought there might be some magic environment variable or the like :)
12:10  zomg: Well I'd rather have less magic =)
12:13  Silex: MarcWeber: the c++ snippets for snipmate are kinda bad (coded by a C guy)
12:13  Silex: MarcWeber: do you think I'd propose a commit for fixing them or would that be considered too destructive reguarding all people that use it?
12:13  Silex: MarcWeber: hum, I guess I'd ask snipmate's author instead :) sorry

12:44  mattcodes: okay, :buffers show 2 files, how can I split them, my screens show one file atm no split, if I do ctrl+w v it just splits the current file?
12:44  noneo:  /join #perl
12:45  mattcodes: I want to take whats in the buffer and split them
12:45  mattcodes: over the screen
12:58  marlun: mattcodes: vsplit filename?
12:58  KeeperOfTheSoul_: how do I go to the next unmatched ']' ?
13:00  marlun: mattcodes: or sbuffer <bufnumber>
13:01  mattcodes: thanks

13:15  juliohm: why "+y don't works?
13:16  KeeperOfTheSoul_: define doesn't work
13:17  juliohm: when i press and then try to paste in chromium for example. Clipboard system can't see the register
13:18  juliohm: to paste in chromium, is in the normal way, correct? a simple Ctrl+v?
13:20  juliohm: i have to install vim-full? http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Cut/copy_and_paste_using_visual_selection
13:20  juliohm: why vim don't came with it by default? o.O
13:22  KeeperOfTheSoul_: juliohm: I'd check :version see if it has +clipboard
13:24  juliohm: KeeperOfTheSoul, here -clipboard
13:24  KeeperOfTheSoul_: then that is why, the version you have was compiled without clipboard support
13:24  juliohm: o.O unbelievable
13:24  KeeperOfTheSoul_: probably to remove reliance on X11 or similar libraries
13:25  juliohm: hmmm
13:25  deryni: vimgor: vim-tiny
13:25  vimgor: vim-tiny is the default Vim package for Debian/Ubuntu. It is built with a small subset of features and is not intended to be used full-time. You most likely want to install a more capable package of the Vim editor. If you want gvim install the vim-gtk package, otherwise install the vim package.
13:25  KeeperOfTheSoul_: yeah, so to avoid dependencies so you don't also have to have the whole of X11 installed
13:26  FernandoBasso: Install vim-gnome or vim-gtk.
13:26  juliohm: so, how to put this to work without install a lot of dependencies?
13:26  juliohm: FernandoBasso, you talk from Brazil too?
13:26  FernandoBasso: juliohm: Yeah.
13:26  juliohm: =)
13:26  FernandoBasso: RS.
13:26  deryni: You don't. You need a non-vim-tiny vim to get +clipboard. So you need to install one of them and its dependencies (or build it yourself with whatever minimum subset is needed to get *just* +clipboard).
13:27  juliohm: deryni, how can i do that?
13:27  deryni: Do what?
13:28  juliohm: how to install the minimum to get +clipboard working
13:28  juliohm: ?
13:28  FernandoBasso: juliohm: You'd have to compile vim yourself, and look the compile options.
13:28  deryni: Right.
13:29  juliohm: =(
13:29  mattcodes: mine doesnt work
13:29  mattcodes: have +version
13:29  mattcodes: pressed v$y
13:29  mattcodes: yank the line
13:29  deryni: And I don't know for certain that there is a smaller useful set than what you get with the vim-gtk package.
13:29  mattcodes: tried ctrl+V  / shift-insert in xchat
13:29  mattcodes: no luck
13:29  FernandoBasso: juliohm: Why you don't want to install vim-gnome or vim-gtk?
13:29  mattcodes: and mine has +clipboard
13:29  deryni: Plus you'd need to install all the build dependencies to do that anyway.
13:29  deryni: mattcodes: You need to use the "+ or "* register.
13:30  FernandoBasso: mattcodes: You have to do comething like "+y to copy something into the clipboard.
13:30  FernandoBasso: and "+p to paste from the clipboard.
13:30  juliohm: how to see all registered in vim?
13:30  deryni: :reg ?
13:30  juliohm: ok
13:30  FernandoBasso: You have to type quotes plus sign and an operator.
13:30  mattcodes: newb question, is that the keys you press, thats hand jungle if Ive ever seen one just to copy?
13:30  deryni: I'm assuming you meant how do you see the contents of the vim registers.
13:30  mattcodes: feeling the rsi
13:31  deryni: mattcodes: That's how you copy into the WM clipboard.
13:31  deryni: You can set the clipboard option to automate some of that if you want. :he 'clipboard
13:32  juliohm: deryni, is clipboard or xclipboard?
13:33  deryni: xclipboard is a program, clipboard (in this sense) is a vim setting.
13:34  deryni: Sorry, that was unclear and unhelpful.
13:34  deryni: vim has internal registers which hold copied text, X has a clipboard as well.
13:34  deryni: Those are separate under normal circumstances, you can use the "+ and "* registers in vim to connect/bridge the two.
13:35  MarcWeber: Silex: I maintain a snippet fork anyway. You should try it. MAybe we should splite snippet code from snippet files. Proposing a patch won't hurt. snippets are kind of personal anyway.
13:35  juliohm: deryni, tnks for explanation
13:35  MarcWeber: Silex: We could also add a feauture ignoring some specific snippet files.
13:36  Silex: MarcWeber: aight, I think I'll just propose a patch for the c++ snippets rewritten in a c++ way and then keep a repo for my own snippets
13:37  Silex: that way I can simply change the origin of git's snipmate and go :UpdateAddons snipmate for it to use my own snippets
13:40  juliohm: the last question... gvim are now named vim-gnome?
13:41  juliohm: i try to put apt-cache show gvim... but nothing happens
13:41  Silex: juliohm: try apt-cache search gvim
13:42  Silex: but yeah, vim-gnome sounds like it
13:42  juliohm: tnks Silex ;)
13:42  juliohm: i will install it
13:43  juliohm: and the problem of clipboard will be fixed, right?
13:47  FernandoBasso: juliohm: in ubuntu I used to install the vim-gnome package. Everything worked fine.
13:49  juliohm: FernandoBasso, tnks ;)
13:49  juliohm: i will install
13:50  FernandoBasso: I was wondering... I updated ubuntu in my sons' machine to the 10.10 version and it still does not ship with vim 7.3. That is unacceptable. Vim 7.3 is around for a reasonable amount of time already.
13:52  Silex: FernandoBasso: I think you'd complain to the #debian folks
13:53  FernandoBasso: Silex: Of course. I was just making a comment.
13:53  iaj: can I somehow find out WHY my vim freezes sometimes?
13:53  FernandoBasso: iaj: An incompatible plugin?
13:57  gniourf_gniourf: Hi, can someone give me his/her output of ":! echo $TERM" ? Mine is "dumb", and I get awful displays of man pages
13:57  gniourf_gniourf: on both Ubuntu 9.04 and Debian Squeeze
13:58  gniourf_gniourf: or if somebody has a prescription for that...
14:00  iaj: FernandoBasso: Hmmm dunno.... it occurs pretty randomly...
14:00  iaj: my whole MacVim freezes and theres nuffing left but to kill it
14:01  FernandoBasso: iaj: Have you tried starting vim without loading any plugins yet?
14:02  iaj: FernandoBasso: nopes... but this will be my next step then... I'm just thinking of a way
14:02  tmr: gniourf_gniourf, under gvim?
14:02  FernandoBasso: iaj: --noplugin
14:02  gniourf_gniourf: tmr, yes, gvim 7.2
14:03  tmr: gniourf_gniourf, I succest better terminal amulator, like xterm.
14:03  iaj: FernandoBasso: hmmm... yeh.. but I wanna try in macvim as well
14:03  gniourf_gniourf: tmr, when I do this it's even worse: !TERM=xterm man man
14:04  gniourf_gniourf: and I've tried all the terms I have in my terminfo dirs... none of them display mans correctly
14:04  iaj: FernandoBasso: working in terminal vim.... as far as I can see.. so far
14:04  juliohm: where i can find a complete map of keys defined by default in VIM? F1, F2,... are defined? i thinking in map some useful commands
14:05  tmr: gniourf_gniourf, lying about terminal to software usually makes things worse yes.
14:05  gniourf_gniourf: tmr, so is gvim "dumb"? :(
14:05  gniourf_gniourf: I'd love to have a terminfo that corresponds to gvim, but I just can't find anything
14:05  tmr: gniourf_gniourf, when you try to use it as terminal it is.
14:06  gniourf_gniourf: so everybody here has bad displays of man pages?
14:06  tmr: My man pages show up perfectly in xterm.
14:07  gniourf_gniourf: in xterm yes... so I'll stick to that then...
14:07  gniourf_gniourf: thanks
14:08  FernandoBasso: gvim not showing help pages correctly? Strange...
14:09  gniourf_gniourf: FernandoBasso, yes... what is your output of :!echo $TERM
14:09  FernandoBasso: gniourf_gniourf: From gvim?
14:09  gniourf_gniourf: FernandoBasso, yes
14:10  FernandoBasso: gniourf_gniourf: Pay attention :!echo $TERM 'dumb' --> :echo $TERM 'linux'   (the latter is *without* !)
14:11  gniourf_gniourf: here :echo $TERM is 'xterm'
14:11  gniourf_gniourf: weird
14:16  iaj: ok my vim only crahes when I load up .pl files in MacVim... but I don't have anything in ftplugin/perl

14:53  Silex: is it possible to disable a plugin after it's been loaded?
15:09  silentmind: how can I set the title of a tab in gvim? I want just the filename rather than the full path
15:09  silasdavis: Is there a way of doing an inclusive 'T' movement?
15:09  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: Use F instead.
15:10  silasdavis: FernandoBasso: but that will include the character I am searching to, which I don't want...
15:10  silasdavis: example: (some text)
15:10  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: Then I don't understand what do you mean by "inclusive T movement".
15:11  silasdavis: with the final bracket selected I want to delete 'some text'
15:11  silasdavis: uh no
15:11  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: go inside the ( ) and do di( or di)
15:12  silasdavis: dT( works for my example actually, how about this:
15:12  silasdavis: name: a name
15:13  silasdavis: I have the last e selected and I want to select ' a name'
15:13  silasdavis: FernandoBasso: di) is interesting also though
15:14  FernandoBasso: name: a name --> I'd do v2T<Space>
15:17  silasdavis: FernandoBasso: doesn't get me the final e, or the leading space
15:19  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: Have you gone through vimtutor yet?
15:19  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: Also, :help motions
15:19  silasdavis: FernandoBasso: yes
15:20  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: I'm not an expert myself. Sory.
15:20  silasdavis: do you think v2T<Space> should have worked..
15:20  silasdavis: ah that's okay
15:20  FernandoBasso: Yes. I do.
15:20  FernandoBasso: If you are on the final e in "name: a name'
15:22  silasdavis: FernandoBasso: this may be oddities of windows compatibility in vim
15:22  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: It is always nice to practice with v mode on, so that we can actually see what is being operated on.
15:22  silasdavis: when I go into visual mode the last e is deselected
15:23  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: But try to delete it to see. Sometimes the colorscheme make it seem that it is not selected.
15:24  silasdavis: have done, definitely not selected... you are definitely getting the expected behaviour with the line 'name: a name'?
15:24  silasdavis: tried in cygwin vim with same result too
15:24  FernandoBasso: Yeah.
15:26  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: What OS?
15:26  silasdavis: windows..
15:26  silasdavis: But!
15:26  silasdavis: I justed ssh'd home
15:26  silasdavis: it works as you describe on my linux machine
15:26  FernandoBasso: I'm running arch linux.
15:26  silasdavis: yeah the one at home is a sabayon machine
15:27  silasdavis: anyway v2F<Space> does it
15:28  silasdavis: (rather than T)
15:28  silasdavis: as does vT:
15:28  FernandoBasso: F if you do want to include the space. T if you don't.
15:30  iaj: if Im sitting on the last e.. like  bas[e] and want to change to the f before that base word.. INCLUDING the e.. how would I do so? is there an easier way than lyTf? (eg without the l?!)
15:31  FernandoBasso: iaj: In what 'string' ?
15:32  FernandoBasso: Oh. I'd use do: vFf
15:32  FernandoBasso: Because (at least here) the T or F does not include the char the cursor is on.
15:33  iaj: FernandoBasso: yeah.. that's the thing... so without visualmode theres an additional movement command necessary
15:33  iaj: to catch the 'e'
15:34  FernandoBasso: iaj: You are right. I am not aware of other way besides your option and mine. Also, what if there is no more chars to the right? Then we cannot use 'l' because there is no more place to go (to the right).
15:35  FernandoBasso: In this last case, only with v, I think.
15:36  iaj: or FfC yeah :\
15:37  FernandoBasso: Hmm. FfD also words then.
15:38  FernandoBasso: Why doesn't dFf work?
15:39  estragib: f and t are inclusive motions, F and T exclusive
15:39  iaj: estragib: I think he ment the char below the cursor
15:40  FernandoBasso: estragib: I know that. The problem that I can't understand is another thing.
15:40  silasdavis: iaj: I was just asking this, I think there should be a non-visual way of doing it
15:40  FernandoBasso: silasdavis: Do like iaj said. 2T<scpace>D or C
15:41  FernandoBasso: estragib: Because doing, for instance: dTe does not delete the char the cursor is on.
15:41  estragib: i don't think there is. it's an inherent limitation of inclusive/exclusive definition of motions. otherwise you'd need another set of motions.
15:43  FernandoBasso: *dTe* does not include the char the cursor is no. However, *TeD* does.
15:45  FernandoBasso: So, the visual mode is still the best solution.
15:45  estragib: yeah, well, D just deletes everything after including the last char. just have to keep in mind that the backward motions are exclusive, the forward motions inclusive.
15:45  estragib: FernandoBasso: agree, for inclusive backwards motion, visual is best
15:46  macrobat: is there a concept of "point" here, like in *emacs*? :D
15:46  FernandoBasso: estragib: I was not aware of this piece of information you've just stated. About backwards vs forward motion exclusive vs inclusive.
15:47  estragib: FernandoBasso: i'm not certain if it applies generally. it seems this way to me, looking over the motions help entries
15:47  FernandoBasso: estragib: Okay. Thanks any way.
15:50  macrobat: what's the difference between :nmap and :nnoremap ?
15:50 --- sora_h is now known as sorah_off
15:51  spiiph: :h :noremap
15:51  macrobat: i don't see anything helpful :D
15:52  FernandoBasso: macrobat: Sometimes the :help *might* seem hard to understand. Be patient with yourself.
15:53  spiiph: It describes all the :nore map commands. Compare the help paragraph to that for :map for maximum effect.
15:54  spiiph: macrobat, also read :h recursive_mapping
15:54  jzacsh: anyone know how to get more depth out of variable-traces on vim's xdebug plugin?
15:54  estragib: macrobat: for an instructive example do a :map K KK and hit K :p
15:55  estragib: macrobat: <C-C> to stop it
15:56  d0ugal: When I'm in insert mode, how do I move around without using the arrow keys?
15:56  macrobat: i still dont understand :help. been trying to for a year and a half. i get the recursiveness
15:56  rushfan: Hi. is there a way to tell .vimrc to use different colorschemes for console vim and gvim/
15:56  macrobat: d0ugal: ctrl-o and then hjkl
15:56  FernandoBasso: d0ugal: Vim is meant to change modes all the time.
15:56  FernandoBasso: Get used to it.
15:56  macrobat: i mean ctrl-o and any movement
15:56  d0ugal: macrobat: Nice, thanks
15:56  macrobat: ctrl-o changes the mode temporarily and puts you back in insert, though :D
15:57  d0ugal: FernandoBasso: Yeah, but I keep ending up in the edit mode without being at the end of the line since you can “sit” on the return character
15:57  d0ugal: FernandoBasso: anyway, macrobat's tip done the trick
15:58  d0ugal: hmm actually it doesn't
15:58  d0ugal: nevermind
15:59  FernandoBasso: d0ugal: Try 'A'.
15:59  macrobat: repeat ctrl-o for a new oppurtunity for movement
15:59  d0ugal: FernandoBasso: bingo.

22:03  jeffszusz: does that make eclipse more vimlike or vim eclipselike?
22:03  gkatsev: eclim is better, though, it doesnt work for everyone.
22:04  iaj: gkatsev: did you ever check it?
22:04  iaj: will vim have all the completion stuff that eclipse offers?
22:04  MarcWeber: jeffszusz: I like the quickfix features of Eclipse. I use them a lot.
22:04  gkatsev: what viplugin? or eclim?
22:04  iaj: gkatsev: eclim.
22:05  gkatsev: iaj: it depends on the mode you use. eclim has 3. headless eclipse, side-by-side and vim-inside.
22:05  iaj: which did you chose?
22:05  iaj: headless eclipse.. is plain vim right?
22:05  MarcWeber: Also the refactoring tools (rename etc) are nice. But eclim seems to have it as well?
22:05  MarcWeber: iaj: Eclipse must be started. VIm talks to the Eclipse which does no longer have a gui.
22:05  gkatsev: headless eclipse is plain vim but it enables you to use eclipse's debugger inside of vim and use it with make and stuff.
22:06  gkatsev: but it does not have any of the refactoring features of eclipse.
22:06  gkatsev: it does have code completion, i believe.
22:06  MarcWeber: http://eclim.org/vim/java/refactor.html gkatsev Its new
22:06  iaj: I tried to set up eclim here.. but I failed.. some time ago :(
22:06  gkatsev: (actually, I never gotten it working, lol when I really needed it)
22:07  gkatsev: MarcWeber: oh, cool.
22:07 * gkatsev hates java.
22:07  SIGBUS: hi, after writing "<" in a cpp file, i get the following error http://vim.pastey.net/141535 ; any ideas?
22:07  gkatsev: s/hates/doesn't like/
22:08  mgedmin: SIGBUS, bug in some plugin
22:08  mgedmin: run :verbose function AutoAlign to see which one
22:08 * jeffszusz likes the look of eclim
22:09  SIGBUS: i haven't installed any additional plugins. using vim 7.3 from the gentoo repo, but the problem used to happen in 7.2.
22:10  gkatsev: next time I need to use java and eclipse, will definitely take a look at eclim again
22:10 * jeffszusz wonders if eclim will work on his mac
22:11  iaj: jeffszusz: im just checking out :-)
22:11  SIGBUS: the problem is in /usr/share/vim/vimfiles/plugin/AutoAlign.vim , line 70 has an if clause, but it is quite hard to debug it :\
22:12  SIGBUS: i've moved the vimrc and the problem persists
22:12  jeffszusz: thanks so much for this eclim thing: it says it does work in OS X too
22:12  jeffszusz: I"m going to use it
22:12  jeffszusz: :D
22:12  jeffszusz: but I will probably use it embedded in the eclipse environment
22:12  iaj: gkatsev: when you tried it, did you do headless?
22:13  jeffszusz: this is a whole other level of awesome...
22:13  mgedmin: SIGBUS, it's not a standard vim plugin
22:14  joe: w/ visual mode is there a way to cup and the paste a block easily from on e location to an other?
22:15  mgedmin: google tells me AutoAlign.vim is http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=884
22:15  SIGBUS: thanks a lot, seems that the gentoo ebuild is adding third-party plugins... :\
22:15  fow: joe, visual block mode -> d -> move to the other location -> p
22:17  SIGBUS: yes, it's the same plugin. and seems that here's the old version. thanks, mgedmin :)
22:18  joe: fow, wow, simple enough. thanks
22:19  fow: you're welcome
22:21  joe: fow, hmm for multiple lines it's only taking the first few character even when go to the end of the top line then down. why would that be ie I can't seem to select the full text block I want
22:23  mgedmin: joe, use visual line mode (shift-v), not visual block mode (ctrl-v)
22:24  joe: mgedmin, perfect thanks!
22:34  sanmarcos: what is the key to identify the current character?
22:34  sanmarcos: like the ascii number it has etc?
22:36  silas: sanmarcos: :he ascii :-)
22:36  mgedmin: ga
22:37  jkyle: is there a way to trace what filters are called when you execute a command? My undo is horribly broken
22:39  mgedmin: filters?
22:39  jkyle: I assume that vim's undo is not intrinsically horribly broken, so it must be a plugin or something that's effecting it
22:40  gkatsev: try :verbose undo?
22:41  jkyle: doesn't tell me much
22:41  jkyle: undo is pretty much unusable though. been relying on version controll to roll back changes >.<
22:43  mgedmin: define broken?
22:43  gkatsev: well, thats what you should anyway.
22:43  gkatsev: jkyle: check out :history
22:44  mgedmin: are you perhaps switching between buffers all the time without enabling 'hidden'?
22:44  gkatsev: that would break undo
22:44  mgedmin: do you perhaps have 'autoread' set and build tools that keep touching your source files?
22:44  gkatsev: but history should still be intact
22:45  jkyle: mgedmin: when I execute several undo's it only removes part of the text I entered. Leavings bits and pieces still there intermixed with the original text...causing failed compiles and a bunch of "junk" that has to be manually found and deleted (thus breaking the ability to redo)
22:45  mgedmin: ooh
22:45  mgedmin: interesting
22:46  sanmarcos: thanks
22:46  jkyle: hm, it's possible something is touching the files as they are in an IDE project. but I'm pretty sure I see this when the only thing touching the fiels would be vim itself (like one off scripts)
22:46  gkatsev: jkyle: what about :h :history ?
22:48  jkyle: gkatsev: http://objc.pastebin.com/NGGGfNy7
22:48  jkyle: that's a buffer that just messed up on me. looks like there's a lot of gaps
22:50  gkatsev: er, sorry, not history. :changes
22:51  mgedmin: whoa, a pastebin that shows banner ads? *disapprove*
22:51  gkatsev: no, thats not exactly it either...
22:51  gkatsev: mgedmin: you dont have adblock enabled?
22:51  mgedmin: which vim version is that?
22:51  jkyle: yeah, I was having trouble finding one that supported objc syntax.
22:52  jkyle: and I have adblock so I didn't notice, my bad :P
22:52  mgedmin: gkatsev, I do, but I'm currently using an incognito window for testing a web app with multiple different users, and xchat decided to open the link in that one
22:52  jkyle: this is current, 7.3
22:52  mgedmin: chromium's incognito windows disable all extensions by default
22:52  gkatsev: mgedmin: enable adblock in incognito mode?
22:52  mgedmin: let's focus on solving jkyle's problem first
22:52  gkatsev: lol
22:53  jkyle: VIM - Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Aug 30 2010 09:15:40)
22:53 * gkatsev heads home, actually.
22:53 * mgedmin has 7.3.11
22:54 * mgedmin has been using 7.3 since the third beta or so, without any undo-related problems
22:54  iaj: Woah.. Im just checking out eclim... that's awesome!! @ gkatsev .. headless mode.. no annoying slow ECLIPSE
22:54  mgedmin: maybe try upgrading?
22:55  gkatsev: iaj: haha, glad it helps. :)
22:55  Starfire: iaj: I also tried eclim just last week, and was very positively surprised.
22:56  gkatsev: jkyle: maybe something is messed up in your viminfo/vimfiles?
22:56  mgedmin: but how could that break undo?
22:57  gkatsev: idk?
22:57  iaj: Starfire: I just need to find a way to map a certain mapping to .java files...
22:57  gkatsev: mgedmin: just throwing out ideas.
22:57  gkatsev: iaj: au based on filetype
22:58  iaj: gkatsev: can you gimme an example?
22:58  gkatsev: one sec
22:58  Starfire: I'm using eclim with C++, and the completion is super awesome.
22:58  jkyle: you know, it seems to happen with brackets [], or {}, etc. I wonder if it's the completion plugin I use
22:58  jkyle: autoclose.vim
22:58  gkatsev: iaj: autocmd FileType make set noexpandtab shiftwidth=8
22:59 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
22:59 * mgedmin doesn't see any undo-related bugfixes in hg log
23:00  gkatsev: iaj: instead of set you can have map etc
23:00  jkyle: I guess I'll try running vanilla unmodified vim for a a while, then incrementally start loading plugins
23:00 * gkatsev goes home
23:00  gkatsev: bye
23:01  mgedmin: jkyle, can you reliably reproduce the problem?
23:02  jkyle: letyes
23:02  jkyle: yes*
23:02  jkyle: sec
23:03  mgedmin: then start vim -u NONE and see if you can reproduce without any plugins
23:04  jkyle: well, sometimes :P
23:04  jkyle: ok, I'll definitely do that
23:04  marlun: Can I disable all mappings in a buffer/window I've created from my plugin and just add the ones I wan't?
23:04 * jkyle needs to get some miles in on the bike
23:08  mgedmin: marlun, you could :unmap them one-by-one ...
23:09  mgedmin: I don't know if you can remove a global mapping just for one buffer
23:09  fow: perhaps :h :mapc
23:09  fow: not entirely sure what the question s
23:09  fow: *is
23:09  rson: is there an easy way to tell what hilight group a word is in?
23:12  mgedmin: rson, yes
23:13  mgedmin: see the example in :h synstack
23:13  mgedmin: or :h synID
23:13  rson: ty
23:21 --- MikhX_ is now known as MikhX
23:31  marekw2143: hi, how to automatically change indenting by tabs to indenting by spaces?
23:32  literal: marekw2143: :help 'expandtab'
23:32  marekw2143: literal: tahnks
23:33  marekw2143: literal: thanks :)
23:39  jeffszusz: if i want to have two .vimrc files
23:39  jeffszusz: and use one for vim on it's own, but another when macvim is open
23:39  jeffszusz: what might i do?
23:40  jeffszusz: if <something> :source <file> ?
23:40  mgedmin: see if you can distinguish the two
23:40  mgedmin: maybe macvim defines something like has('gui_mac')
23:40  mgedmin: yes
23:41  mgedmin: or just have one .vimrc with a bunch of setting in that :if
23:41  jeffszusz: hm
23:41  jeffszusz: is there a command in vim that will show me it's own settings ?
23:41  jeffszusz: or do i have to open up the macvim package and hunt
23:43  mgedmin: :set
23:43  mgedmin: but you don't want settings, you want features
23:43  mgedmin: :ver
23:43  mgedmin: only that doesn't mention gui_xxx
23:44  mgedmin: try :echo has("gui_mac")
23:44  mgedmin: other things to check with has(): "mac", "macunix","gui_running"
23:46  Raimondi: For macvim you can use 'gui_macvim'
23:46  jeffszusz: ok
23:46  jeffszusz: oh?
23:46  jeffszusz: excellent
23:47  jeffszusz: oh macvim is just using gvim
23:47  iaj: jeffszusz: im using has("gui_running") which is true when running macvim.
23:47 * jeffszusz likes this ":ver" command's output
23:47  Raimondi: add a test for 'gui_running' if you just want to run on the GUI
23:48  jeffszusz: actually i was asking my question more generically than i probably should have, hoping to get an answer I could adapt
23:48  jeffszusz: i actually want to differentiate between using macvim and eclim
23:48  iaj: what's different in your eclim session?
23:48  iaj: jeffszusz: you could just add autocommands to .java files to achieve different behaviour in eclim editing
23:49  jeffszusz: what i'm concerned about is extra plugins i have in vim
23:49  jeffszusz: that i don't need in eclim
23:49  marlun: fow: mapclear seems like what I want. Should I do mapclear <buffer> to make it be for the current buffer only?
23:50  marlun: fow: for example in my case I've got a mapping in my .vimrc for "ctrl-n ctrl-n" which toggles line-numbers however in my plugin I've mapped a single ctrl-n to move the cursor down one line but now vim waits a couple of seconds for a second ctrl-n before it moves down.
23:50  fow: marlun, I'm not sure if it works like that. I've honestly never used mapclear. If the help doesn't specify, I guess I'd go with try it and see
23:51  marlun: fow: yeah I tried and vim still waits.
23:51  fow: marlun, perhaps you want to use <leader> for your plugin or maybe change 'timeoutlen' or 'ttimeoutlen'?
23:53  marlun: fow: well other plugins that I use also use ctrl-n to move down but vim doesn't wait there, will take a look in them and see if I can find something.
23:53  marlun: Time to go to bed now, goodnight! :)
23:53  iaj: jeffszusz: oh.. I get you now - ohwell..  I don't know :\ I'm just continueing using them
