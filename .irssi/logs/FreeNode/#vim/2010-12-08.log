00:01  spetrea_: anyone know a good indent file for js ? I'm using vim every day with js and I hate it when it doesn't indent my code properly
00:01  spetrea_: there are many indent .vim scripts out there for js but I haven't yet found one that works properly, if someone knows one please link me up
00:01  spetrea_: thanks
00:02  jamessan: spetrea_: if you're using 7.3, trying using 'cindent' and setting 'cinoptions' appropriately.  there were some JS-specific settings that got added to 'cinoptions' in 7.3
00:03  spetrea_: jamessan: that sounds awesome
00:03  spetrea_: jamessan: are you writing js with vim, have you experienced the difficulties I've mentioned ?
00:05  jamessan: I don't write JS, sorry.  I just know of it from discussion on the vim development list
00:05  spetrea_: jamessan: ah ok thanks

02:11  huffman: I've noticed on some vim installs that I've used that vim automatically goes to the last line I was at when opening a file
02:11  huffman: Where is this set?
02:12  huffman: Or is it something I've inadvertently disabled?
02:12  kedarm: Raimondi: Wanted to know how I can put n lines in System Keyboard. It was related to register +, I guess.

02:15  DHulme: if it's stopped working it's probably owned by root or sth stupid like that
02:15  DHulme: hey spiiph
02:15  spiiph: Or it might be that it's just not enabled.
02:15  spiiph: hi

02:16  ddollar: is there any way to remove the padding \'s on an inactive window's statusline?
02:16  DHulme: yep
02:16  homekevin: ddollar: I don't know what you are referring to.
02:16  DHulme: and I didn't pay
02:16  spiiph: ddollar, :h 'statusline
02:16  DHulme: (work do)
02:17  spiiph: Actually, if you want then on an active window's statusline, you'll have to set statusline on WinEnter and WinLeave

02:19  kedarm: Raimondi: Ooh! Thank you!!
02:19  Raimondi: np
02:20  ddollar: spiiph: i read that but i cant seem to figure out how to remove the padding \\\\'s.. even if i :set statusline=foo i still get \\\'s padded to the right side
02:20  ddollar: sorry if i'm being dense, very new to vim
02:21  homekevin: ddollar: I don't have "padding \". I don't know where you're getting that.

02:27  ddollar: that doesn't produce any output that i can see
02:27  homekevin: ddollar: Are you sure you weren't in window 2 when you did it?
02:27  homekevin: Er, I'm not sure it was right anyway.

02:28  homekevin: It might need no be "&l:statusline"
02:29  homekevin: OK, it seems to work without the l:
02:29  homekevin: That's pretty strange.
02:30  homekevin: ddollar: I'm guessing it might be a WinEnter autocmd that sets it, so you could try :verbose au WinEnter
02:31  ddollar: that only shows matching paren from vim
02:32  homekevin: Hm. Well, that leaves demon possession. Better get a priest.
02:34  homekevin: ddollar: You could try running vim this way to rule out other things: vim -u NONE -N
02:35  ddollar: yeah it definitely seems like a plugin, just trying to grok the vimscript and figure out where
02:35  ddollar: thanks for the help :)
02:36  homekevin: ddollar: Actually, you might check 'ruler' also.
02:36  homekevin: E.g., :verbose set ruler?
02:36  homekevin: Wait, maybe that's not it.
02:36  homekevin: rulerformat
02:37  ddollar: that changes some things, but spaces are still \'s on inactive windows
02:38  homekevin: ddollar: It shouldn't change anything, only report the value. Did you leave off the question mark?
02:38  homekevin: ddollar: You could try :set noruler
02:39  homekevin: That would rule out the ruler. No pun intended.
02:40  homekevin: ddollar: But if you ran vim with -u NONE and still got it, that would suggest a non-Vim problem, possibly.
02:40  ddollar: found it.. it's  fillchars
02:40  ddollar: :set fillchars
02:41  homekevin: Oh, really? I didn't know about that.
02:41  homekevin: Huh, OK.
02:42  homekevin: Well, good job helping yourself in spite of us, ddollar. ;)
02:42  ddollar: set fillchars=stlnc:\  was in one of the plugins i installed
02:42  homekevin: Yuck.
02:42  ddollar: thanks again for the help, was kinda hard to google for
02:42  homekevin: I hate plugins overriding user settings.
02:43  ddollar: :help fillchars
02:43  ddollar: wow i'm going to be doing that a lot
02:47  Raimondi: ddollar: there is :helpgrep  in case :help isn't enough.

10:09  the_isz: danslo: may i suggest that you try out screen or tmux? you can have mutliple shells side-to-side with both and then you could run vim in one and your shell commands in another
10:15  danslo: the_isz: I've been using screen all this time, but I would like to vsplit it so I can see them both at the same time...
10:15  danslo: or does screen support multiple viewports... mm you're making me doubt myself
10:16  danslo: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711 << that looks interesting
10:18  the_isz: danslo: screen does support splits. horizontal for sure and vertical too, iirc. i'm not using them myself, so i'm not completely sure.
10:18  the_isz: danslo: personally, i use a tiling wm and just open a terminal if i need one to show aside of gvim
10:19  danslo: the_isz: that's nice to know for when I'm home, but I'm using OSX at work, no tiling wm for me
10:19  the_isz: danslo: are there screen and tmux for osx?
10:20  danslo: the_isz: there definitely is screen, yes
10:20  Raimondi: the_isz: tmux via macports, at least
10:21  the_isz: danslo: the standard screen supports horizontal splits only, but i'm sure i found a version that also features vertical ones.

10:46  Miesco: Thats in my .vimrc
10:46  Miesco: Its not working
10:46  Silex: your .vimrc is executed before the file you want to load is loaded
10:47  Silex: so, filetype isn't set at this time

10:52  spiiph: Hail_Spacecake, :h :highlight
10:59  Number5: hello guys, how can I higlight lines where a certain character occurs less than 6 times. If you can provide me a good link, where I can do such actions, would be much appreciated. Thank you.
10:59  the_isz: Number5: are the characters consecutive?
11:00  the_isz: Number5: better: do the certain characters appear consecutively?
11:00  Number5: the_isz: what do you mean by consecutive? I need to find lines that occurs number of tabs less than 6 times.
11:01  Number5: number of '^I' < 6
11:01  Number5: then highlight.
11:01  Number5: don't know how to tell that to vim.
11:02  the_isz: Number5: i mean, do the tabs appear after one another or anywhere in the line? like  \t\t\t\t\t\t  or  \ts\tb\t\tys\t\t
11:02  Number5: the_isz: the latter one
11:02  the_isz: phew...
11:03  the_isz: Number5: you could do a search based on regular expressions for starters
11:03  Number5: The reason is, I need to import a tsv file into sqlite database. But sqlite complains about some lines are missing columns, which means a tab or two are missing.
11:04  tomcheng76: why ESC escape from INSERT mode slowly? i feel some lag which did not happen before. the file is not big, just 30KB
11:04  Number5: the_isz: can you provide me such a link. I'm a C programmer, but regex is something I don't have a feeling with, though I need to learn it some time.
11:04  seku: maybe it is waiting for another command which starts with esc tomcheng76
11:04  the_isz: Number5: :he pattern.txt  ;) but gimme a sec, i'm thinking
11:05  Number5: the_isz: I give even 10 seconds :P
11:05  tomcheng76: seku: this will paste words which i don't want, press it quickly  i + ESC + j
11:05  the_isz: Number5: try  /^\(.*\t\)\{1,5}[^\t]$     (untested)
11:05  tomcheng76: if i wait the ESC, it don't have problem
11:05  Number5: hahaha, ok I'll test it.
11:06  seku: tomcheng76: then you have a mapping somewhere
11:06  tomcheng76: seku: how to check ?
11:06  seku: not sure, but i think map commands and grep are a good start
11:08  the_isz: Number5: hmm... no, that's not quite right yet
11:08  Number5: pattern couldn't be found, anyway, thnx for your help. I'll google for some examples.
11:09  tomcheng76: seku: thanks, let me have a research for them :)
11:09  Number5: the_isz: I really appreciate your help :)
11:10  the_isz: Number5: ok, try this one:    /^\(.*\t\)\{,5}[^\t]*$
11:10  the_isz: Number5: this should find lines with up to 5 tabs
11:13  Number5: thnx, but this match every line :)
11:13  Number5: :se list
11:13  Number5: oops
11:14  cafaro: When i change my theme (wombat) in gvim, everything works as expected, but when I run vim in my terminal, the coloring is different (background doesn change, syntax colors are different), how can I make it the same as gvim?
11:14  the_isz: Number5: yeah, sorry.  /^\([^\t]*\t\)\{,4}[^\t]*$    we're getting closer...
11:15  the_isz: Number5: /^\([^\t]*\t\)\{,5}[^\t]*$
11:15  Number5: hahaha, ok I'll try it again
11:15  akosch: which one is better: sparkup or ZenCoding.vim?
11:16  the_isz: Number5: i got the prob, \t in [] doesn't work... looking for a solution...
11:16  Number5: ok
11:23  the_isz: Number5: ok, got it.  ^\([^\t]*\t\)\{,5}[^\t]*$  was right, i just made a wrong test file.
11:23  Number5: ok, I'll try it.
11:27  Number5: the_isz: I think you got it, thank you very much!
11:27  Number5: Can you help understand the expression?
11:28  Number5: ^ means it begins with
11:28  the_isz: Number5: i don't want to explain everything. see  :he pattern.txt
11:28  the_isz: Number5: everything's in there
11:28  Number5: the_isz: ok, thnx my friend, thank you very much
11:28  the_isz: Number5: you're welcome
11:33  Kream: Can anyone recommend a really good vim cheat sheet to put up next to their computer?
11:34  sitaktif: Kream: the best is to make it yourself because it evolves a lot
11:34  sitaktif: (I mean it evolves with yourself..)
11:35  Silex: Kream: I suggest you also watch some of the http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/
11:35  sitaktif: Anybody knows a "marklist" plugin, which would do like taglist but with marks ?
11:36  sitaktif: (and I dont want signs next to the line number, I want a list :) )
11:36  Silex: sitaktif: FuzzyFinder has its own marks system where you can put a real name to the mark
11:36  the_isz: Kream: additional to what sitaktif says: everyone uses a different set of vim commands regularly, so reading someone else's cheat sheet might not help you a lot. for instance, there are many people here practically never using hjkl, while i use it all the time (though i'm trying to reduce)
11:36  Silex: sitaktif: how do you make signs next to the line numbers?
11:36  Silex: sitaktif: and fuzzy finder is all about showing lists
11:36  sitaktif: showmarks plugin
11:36  Silex: thanks
11:37  sitaktif: or (or quickfixsigns.vim ?)
11:37  sitaktif: -or
11:37  sitaktif: rhaa, I'd like to use ff.. but I cannot because cannot compile my vim with ruby at work..
11:38  Kream: the_isz: why are you trying to reduce hjkl ?
11:38  the_isz: Kream: because vim has so much more effective movements than just hjkl
11:39  the_isz: vimgor: movement
11:39  vimgor: In normal mode, all of these keys can move the cursor: ` # $ % ^ * ( ) 0 _ - + w W e E t T I o O { } [[ [] ][ ]] [m [M ]m ]M [( ]) [{ ]} | A f F ge gE gg G g0 g^ g$ g, g; gj gk gI h H j k l L ; ' z. z<CR> z- zz zt zb b B n N M , / ? <C-b> <C-d> <C-e> <C-f> <C-h> <C-i> <C-o> <C-t> <C-u> <C-y> - learn to use all of them
11:39  Kream: huh
11:39  the_isz: Kream: and i of course mean efficient, not effective
11:39  ptl: o0
11:41  Kream: holy crap
11:41  Kream: some of those are really cool
11:41  the_isz: Kream: indeed they are
11:41  the_isz: Kream: and i probably use only about half of them regularly, so i still got lots to learn ;)
11:42  Kream: yeah well it's a bit overwhelming :)
11:42  the_isz: Kream: yeah, you can't learn all at once
11:42  Kream: the_isz: so where do I start ? with the videos right?
11:43  the_isz: Kream: i haven't watched the videos. did you try vimtutor?
11:43  Kream: not enough pictures
11:43  Kream: ;)
11:43  the_isz: vimtutor is really good and will teach you the basics of what you need to know about vim
11:44  chrischambers: Kream: http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html
11:44  chrischambers: between that and vimtutor, you should get the foundations down pretty well
11:45  chrischambers: then, as others have said, you should just modify your own cheatsheet as your needs change
11:45  chrischambers: imho
11:45  the_isz: i saw a video presentation from bram himself giving quite good pieces of advice on how to edit efficiently (not even very specific to vim). the best one was: note when you're repeating yourself and amend :)
11:52  Kream: thanks chrischambers and the_isz
11:52  the_isz: Kream: you're welcome
11:53  Kream: I'm interested in using vim more efficiently because I've switched to Mutt for email; this means that my old method of using keyboard cursor keys and pressing dd and p and u is turning out to be inadequate
12:16  Kream: how do i ask vimgor what a particular option, such as formatoptions does?
12:23  iaj: Kream: I'd rather try to learn to use vim's help efficiently ;-)
12:24  seku: the help is good
12:24  seku: :h and :helpgrep
12:24  seku: and :cn
12:25  seku: and #vim
12:26  seku: when following tags in help, ctrl+t goes back to previous node. And thats all you need to use it (in gvim anyway, since you can click the tags)
12:28  iaj: avoid clicking :)
12:35  Kream: Well, my feedback is that the features such as the help may be very powerful and complete indeed but :h means nothing to me at this time. Ditto :helpgrep & :cn ... and I'm assuming #vim refers only to this channel.
12:36  patrask: is there any way to share buffers between multiple windows (like emacs with multiple frames)?
12:37  Kream: hmmm :h
12:37  Kream: eh, step initial learning curve :)
12:37  Kream: steep, even
12:39  kurkale6ka: Kream: there is vimtutor as well
12:39  Kream: yup.
12:39  Kream: going to sit down with it this weekend.
12:41  kurkale6ka: yeah it's pretty well done, good starting point
12:53  exDM69: I just built vim from the mercurial repo sources, I tried the default and the vim73 branches. In gvim my screen is rendered all funny, has these strange thick horizontal white lines everywhere and the backspace key does not work properly. The characters get erased with delay
12:53  exDM69: it's practically unusable
12:53  exDM69: anyone else had similar issues?
12:57  the_isz: exDM69: never tried compiling vim myself...
12:57  exDM69: I wanted 7.3 instead of 7.2 that's in ubuntu
12:57  exDM69: but I guess I'll be satisfied with that
12:58  exDM69: oh noes, I have the exact same problem with the vim 7.2 that came iwht ubuntu
12:58  exDM69: goddamn it
13:07  exDM69: http://e-werk.entropy.fi/~riku/vim-broken.png  has anyone had this symptom?

13:27  Altreus: by which I mean how can I
13:28  spiiph: Depends
13:28  spiiph: Try <C-w>L
13:29  Altreus: bang on :)
13:29  Altreus: What help section is this in? I looked through :he split but there was a lot of it
13:29  spiiph: :h CTRL-w
13:29  Altreus: magic, ta
13:30  exDM69: daniel: moving my cursor over the text will fix the colors, ctrl-l will screw them up again :(
13:30  Altreus: ^W R was what I was trying to remember for my roundabout solution!
13:33  Silex: exDM69: what OS is it?
13:33  Silex: what vim version?
13:35  exDM69: Silex: ubuntu 10.10, vim 7.2 from ubuntu repos, vim hg default branch and vim73 branch all have the same symptoms
13:36  Silex: exDM69: weird. It happens in both vim and gvim?
13:41  exDM69: Silex: nope, only gvim
13:42  exDM69: Silex: vim and my terminal work fine
13:42  exDM69: I do see something a bit strange so I might have a vram corruption bug going on

13:43  ptl: Kunda: in Brazil, your nickname *almost* means what people have in the end of their... "notochords"
13:43  daniel: You could try running some vram intensive stuff and see whether it is fine
13:43  daniel: E.g. quake3 ;)
13:44  exDM69: I also have access to another GPU if needed
13:46  exDM69: wonder if I can find something easier than quake 3
13:46  exDM69: are the q3 demo maps available in ubuntu repos?
13:46  Kunda: ptl. it describes embryos?
13:47  Kunda: ptl: it's a sanskrit name for fire
13:47  daniel: exDM69: Maybe there are 3D benchmarks on Linux? dunno
13:48  mavvert: or try glxgears :p
13:48  daniel: haven't benchmarked my gpu in linux, since it is mainly useless anyways ;-)
13:48  exDM69: daniel: I'll try stellarium, it's pretty texture intensive
13:48  daniel: mavvert: glxgears does not have textures, though
13:48  Kunda: ptl, i know that in bulgaria it means a sloppy <enter derogatory remark of female prostitute>
13:48  mavvert: mhh
13:49  ptl: I've told you the meaning in a private message... :) Hope you don't mind.
13:50  Ecco: Hi everyone
13:51  Ecco: Quick question : is there any "good practice" for opening a "reference" when editing text ?
13:51  Ecco: For instance, if I'm editing CSS and that I'm on a "font-family" word, I would like to open the relevant page on W3C.org
13:59  iaj: hmm when I do a :colorscheme cloudsmidnight in vim everything turns out to work fine - however when I source my .vimrc which got that line involved I get: http://pastebin.com/2ecHiT5h
13:59  iaj: someone able to tell me what's going wrong?
14:01  iaj: And another thing that's bugging me - is there any way to have MacVim started in maximized state?  Im currently trying to achieve this by setting columns, lines to a  high value - but isn't there some other way
14:05  qfr: I am editing Ruby source code and I was wondering if there was some way to get something like "go to definition of this function" within the same file, while my cursor is within the name of a function that is being called
14:06  mavvert: iaj: try removing the space in the colorscheme filename
14:06  Silex: qfr: gd goes to variables declarations
14:06  Silex: try if it works for methods
14:07  qfr: It does, thanks
14:07  qfr: At least to some extent
14:08  qfr: It just goes to the first match in the file, independently of where it's actually defined it seems :p
14:08  qfr: But it's a start
14:08  Silex: qfr: also press # until you get there should work too
14:08  Silex: or *
14:08  Silex: and as it's highlighted it makes it easy to spot it
14:08  qfr: Oh yeah that's useful alright
14:11  iaj: mavvert: hmmm doesn't change :(
14:12  qfr: Silex hmm that doesn't perform any highlighting for me though
14:12  Silex: qfr: set hlsearch
14:12  iaj: mavvert: well I dropped a copy of my cloudsmidnight theme in that runtime path now ;\ fixed it.
14:12  mavvert: iaj: you installed the colorscheme in ~/.vim/colors ?
14:12  Silex: or smth like that
14:12  qfr: Ah thanks
14:13  mavvert: iaj: hmm.. weird =)
14:13  qfr: Yep it works, thanks
14:13  iaj: mavvert: yeah prior it was in .vim/colors only
14:13  Silex: qfr: I guess making some mappings that do ?\v^def\s+stuffundercursor should work too
14:14  mavvert: iaj: i actually changed stuff in there to get my colorscheme working... seems like a lot of runtime stuff overrides stuff in ~/.vim
14:14  mavvert: hmm.. i use the word stuff too much.
14:15  iaj: stuffed!
14:15  iaj: :-)
14:15  mavvert: :D
14:15  iaj: which colorscheme do you use mavvert?
14:15  mavvert: iaj: i use a modified zenburn/wombat thingy
14:16  iaj: mavvert: do you have a screen handy? maybe.. :)     btw grats, you managed to drop a sentence without stuff in it :)
14:16  qfr: Silex is it possible to get those highlights even without searching up/down?
14:16  qfr: Sometimes I just want to see references
14:16  qfr: Instead of browsing them
14:16  mavvert: iaj: http://img203.imageshack.us/img203/8205/vim0.png
14:21  Silex: qfr: hum, what do you mean?
14:22  Silex: qfr: I mean, using * will highlight all the stuffs
14:23  qfr: Silex my cursor is currently within a word abc. I now want all occurences of abc to be highlighted
14:23  qfr: Yes but that would change the cursor position which I do not want
14:23  Silex: I'd press *N
14:23  Silex: :)
14:23  qfr: That's a hack :[
14:23  Silex: but good question,I don't know. Probably :h highlight can help
14:24  strull_: you can try nnoremap * :call histadd("/",'\<'.expand("<cword>").'\>')<cr>:let @/=histget("/",-1)<cr>:se hlsearch<cr>
14:25  EselTheo: Ecco: :help 'keywordprg' is probably what you were looking for.
14:25  qfr: Wow, that sounds complicated
14:25  Ecco: EselTheo: thanks :-)
14:25  strull_: just copy and paste it
14:26  strull_: it works for me since years
14:26  Ecco: EselTheo: Well, this doesn't seem to be language-specific, is it ?
14:28  EselTheo: If you set it in ~/.vim/ftplugin/<yourfiletype>.vim, you can make its value dependent on the file type.
14:28  Ecco: Oh, indeed
14:28  Ecco: But what if my file is a mix ?
14:28  Ecco: For instance, CSS in an .html file ?
14:29  iaj: mavvert: looks nice, any way you gonna share?
14:31  mavvert: iaj: its quite a messy scheme, i put lots of stuff from other themes in
14:31  mavvert: iaj: can pastebin it though, if you want :)
14:33  iaj: heh.. I don't care just gonna call it mavvert and put it into colors.
14:36  mavvert: iaj: http://pastebin.com/VnS8WZkv
14:43  bloger: how do I copy selected text?
14:43  zomg: y
14:46  bloger: zomg: v,v. y?
14:48  seku: y in normal mode after you've visual, visual line or visual block selected the text you want to yank (=copy)
14:51  seku: or use a motion... ya" or something
14:51  seku: (to copy "a string" with the quotes on the same line with cursor)
14:52  seku: thats not a motion but a text object, but doesn't matter.
14:55  bloger: i highligh word with "v". now what?
14:55  iaj: hit y :p
14:58  bloger: iaj: nothing happen, cursor just return to first char of word.
15:00  iaj: yeh.. hit p now..
15:00  iaj: and see what happens ( you can make undo with 'u' afterwards )
15:00  iaj: make undo. omg what an english - undo the operation ...
15:01  bloger: Already at oldest change
15:02  iaj: if you got a word selected with v as you said .. y should 'yank = copy' it.. so you can do p (paste) afterwards in order to ..paste ;p it.
15:03  bloger: iaj: got it.
15:04  iaj: yummy.
15:08  bloger: iaj: I do 'v', 'v', 'p'. correct way?
15:10  sitaktif: fuzzyfinder is really a killerplugin *_*
15:10  seku: bloger: do vimtutor to get started
15:11  mavvert: sitaktif: how so ? ^^
15:11  sitaktif: I mean it is a rly good plugin that's all...
15:12  bloger: seku: I read |quickref|
15:13  LeoNerd: People.... What is current state-of-the-art for mapping such keys as Alt-+ ?
15:13 * LeoNerd is getting annoyed
15:15 * LeoNerd in fact gives up and goes on more standard Ctrl-PageDown
15:15  seku: if you mean how to map it, :nmap <M-+> :echo "Fuzzy eyebrows"<cr>
15:16  LeoNerd: Yeah... watch that break on terminal
15:16  LeoNerd: works fine in gvim
15:16  Silex: bloger: vvp should be equivalent to just p
15:16  Silex: I mean v enters visual mode, v quits it, then p
15:16  seku: i
15:17  LeoNerd: Ah. There we are. Ctrl-{PageDown,PageUp} works nicely on both terminal and gvim.
15:20  Silex: ctrl-pageup does nothing by me
15:20  the_isz: bloger: you come from emacs?
15:21  LeoNerd: Silex: Indeed... I've just mapped mine to :bn / :bp
15:21  bloger: the_isz: no. I come from joe :-)
15:21  LeoNerd: It's "more standard"... most tab-based programs use it for tab switching. Even irssi uses it that way. :)
15:21  Silex: LeoNerd: I mapped Tab/S-Tab for that
15:21  Silex: :)
15:21  LeoNerd: Whereas.. er.. I like being able to type a tab :P
15:22  Silex: I only mapped it in normal mode
15:22  Silex: insert mode is normal tab
15:22  LeoNerd: Ya...
15:22  Silex: visual mode is indent/deindent
15:22  Silex: my tab key is going to break quickly I realise now
15:22  the_isz: bloger: ok, don't know about joe, just thought i remembered emacs' highlighting to work similar to what you tried. anyway, please try the awesome vimtutor, as already suggested, to get yourself acquainted with vim.
15:22  Silex: :)
15:22  LeoNerd: I've map+imap'ed this
15:22  LeoNerd: Besides, I'm used to Ctrl-Page{up,down} from other programs
15:22  LeoNerd: See above under "standard"
15:23  Silex: good to know
15:23  bloger: the_isz: joe is a console text editor.
15:23  the_isz: LeoNerd: doesn't it bother you to reach for Page{up,down}, putting your fingers away from the home row?
15:23  the_isz: bloger: so is vim ;P
15:25  LeoNerd: the_isz: My hand is practically there anyway... I'm left-handed. -most- letters I type with my left hand. My right does about 25% of the letters, all the punctuations, and can quite easiyl reach the arrows/6block
15:25  LeoNerd: the_isz: Most people don't type like I do.. I find I use a lot more of the keys
15:26  LeoNerd: Besides... Ctrl-PageDown is a -lot- easier to type than Escape Colon B N Enter I
15:26  the_isz: LeoNerd: fair enough... though i thought touch-typing worked for left-handed just as well...
15:26  LeoNerd: It does. I'm jsut weird.
15:27  LeoNerd: I much prefer amodal modified key controls for most of the "quick" operations
15:27  LeoNerd: Simply switching buffers shouldn't require me to also change modes first
15:28  the_isz: LeoNerd: ouch... ok, you probably move in insert mode. that's out of my responsibility ;)
15:28  LeoNerd: Quite..
15:28  the_isz: LeoNerd: just for reference: i use <C-f> to scroll down a page
15:28  the_isz: LeoNerd: but that's of course in normal mode
15:28  LeoNerd: I have Arrows for short moves, Ctrl-Arrows for slightly longer moves, Alt-Arrows for moving vim focus between split windows, Win-Arrows for window manager focus between X11 windows....
15:28  LeoNerd: Arrows move :)
15:29  LeoNerd: It's quite nice to be able to Alt-Left to mvoe focus over sides of a vimdiff, then Win-Left to refocus another X11 window even further to the left. :)
15:29  LeoNerd: nothing => Ctrl => Alt => Win ... each modifier makes an arrow key more "further" in some direction
15:29  sitaktif: LeoNerd: is it possible to see your vimrc? It looked quite complete and I like to take ideas from other ppl ^_^
15:29  LeoNerd: Er... not easily.
15:30  LeoNerd: It's about 2000 lines, split between a lot of plugins, syntax, filetypes, etc...
15:30  sitaktif: don't bother if it is too complicated
15:30  LeoNerd: :)
15:30  sitaktif: :)
15:30  LeoNerd: Besides... it's all _my_ config.. the things _I_ like. I'm not sure how much of that is useful to anyone else
15:36  Silex: qfr: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1599
15:43  malesca: Is there something build in like "r" but that leaves you in insert mode? That is shorter than "xi". It's not a lot to type, just curious if there's a one-letter command.
15:44  peth: s
15:45  Silex: xi isn't like s tho
15:45  Silex: wait, it does
15:48  malfy: is there a reverse for loop in vim?
15:50  iaj: lo there Im using taglist.vim with java files.. however I can only see the function name and its correspondending class name - which, anyhow I don't need to know since I only let me show the tags of the current class file - instead I would want the return parameter to get shown in the taglist - any way to do that?
15:59  sitaktif: LeoNerd: sure, but I tend to have some bites of my conf that come from other's ideas
15:59 * LeoNerd nod, shrug..
15:59  LeoNerd: Well.. if you want it you can grab the lot, but I'm not sure I can be bothered to split individual bits out
16:00  malfy: how do i return this variable from a vimscript?
16:00  malfy: i cant figure it out
16:00  malfy: =/
16:00  malfy: it's a s: variable
16:06  sile: Hi, I want to map my F2 key to execute a script and then press Meta+J to change the window in awesome wm. I have "nnoremap <F2> :!script.sh<CR><M-j>" in .vimrc but it doesn't work. Any idea? :-?
16:07  sitaktif: LeoNerd: Don't worry I don't want you to bother, I was just saying a general statement ;)
16:08  sitaktif: sile: haha
16:08  sitaktif: no, you cannot
16:08  LeoNerd: vim can't (out of the box) send keypresses to other programs
16:08  sile: oh, I understand
16:08  sitaktif: sile: awesome uses plan9 or is it wmii ?
16:09  sile: to be honest I don't know =P
16:09  sitaktif: sile: you may be able to trigger actions by writing in files
16:09  sitaktif: but ask #awesome for that
16:09  sitaktif: reminds me I definitely have to reinstall it <3
16:09  sile: hahahahaha =D
16:09  sile: i'll give it a try thanks!
16:10  the_isz: sile: there is awesome-client!
16:11  twb: I'm writing a patch script in ed.
16:11  twb: Could I use ex in the same way?
16:12 * twb tries
16:12  iaj: I've got a question can I somehow just list the completion matches if I hit foo<C-N>  and there is foobar and fooapple existing?
16:12  mgedmin: yes; some say this is like swatting flies with a laser cannon
16:13 * mgedmin sometimes does vim +'%s/foo/bar/g|x' filename, just because vim's pattern syntax is sometimes convenient
16:13  iaj: eg I want to be able to type after foo... not select by using C-n C-p ?
16:13  mgedmin: iaj, ctrl-d lists all possible completions when in command line editing mode
16:13  iaj: mgedmin: and what about when editing buffers?
16:14  mgedmin: for regular insert mode ... check out 'complete'
16:14  mgedmin: it can show a popup with all the choices
16:14  mgedmin: sorry, 'completeopt'
16:14  iaj: mgedmin: im just trying to figure out a way to have the completion choices shown (not completing to any of them) when I'm coding...
16:14  mgedmin: in fact the popup menu is on by default
16:14  mgedmin: ah, you want to see but not insert
16:15  mgedmin: there's a key for that, I think ... ctrl-l?
16:15  iaj: mgedmin: yup
16:15 * mgedmin goes to check
16:15  mgedmin: no, that's something else
16:15  iaj: mgedmin: actually I want to have it that way: if theres only one match that fits - complete - else show the list of what possible completion choices there are
16:15  twb: OK, vim -E worked interactively, now to just confirm it accepts commands from stdin
16:16  mgedmin: twb, why stdin and not command-line?
16:16  twb: mgedmin: because it's a script
16:16  mgedmin: iaj, ctrl-e
16:16  mgedmin: twb, you say that like scripts can't use the command line
16:17  twb: Huh?
16:17  twb: You mean vi -E -c foo ?
16:17  mgedmin: twb, did you notice my example?  vim +'%s/foo/bar/g|x' filename.txt
16:17  twb: I missed that, sorry
16:17  twb: I'm using stdin because it doesn't all fit on one line.
16:17  mgedmin: you can have multiple commands
16:18  twb: One moment
16:18  iaj: mgedmin: CTRL-E		Insert the character which is below the cursor.  {not in Vi}
16:18  mgedmin: vim -c 'cmd1' -c 'cmd2' ...
16:18  iaj: you sure about that one :)?
16:18  mgedmin: iaj, :h ins-completion
16:18  mgedmin: better yet :h complete_CTRL-E
16:18  twb: I would use TECO, but it isn't installed by default
16:20  iaj: mgedmin: I was looking for longest,menu :)
16:20  iaj: yay
16:21  twb: mgedmin: http://paste.debian.net/101872/
16:24  bloger: why 'p' insert unexpected word?
16:24  mgedmin: yeah, that's not something to put into the command line ...
16:25  ezzieyguywuf: isn't there a way to cleanly close a vim session remotely?
16:25  ezzieyguywuf: bloger: p is paste.
16:27  bloger: ezzieyguywuf: yes, paste previously selected word.
16:27  iaj: mgedmin: is there a way to set completeopt differently (when using C-n and C-p it shall be turned off, but turned on when using ^X^O ^X^U) ?
16:27  rson: bloger: paste previously yanked or deleted content
16:29  ezzieyguywuf: bloger: I was just answering what I assumed was a question on your part:  < bloger> why 'p' insert unexpected word?
16:32  TAsn-work: Hey guys, I'm using omnifunc to auto-complete c syntax, but unfortunately, I can't auto complete stuff like foo->bar->a because it only tries completing according to the type of foo, is there any plugin/whatever to solve that?
16:35  bloger: how do i paste currently highlighted word?
16:36  ezzieyguywuf: is there a way to have the colorscheme's bg color change the color of the whole screen, not just where there is text? for example, if my term is black bg and the colorscheme has a white one, only where there is text/whitespace will there be a white background (currently) and this is distracting.
16:46  zematynnad: any opinions, gotchas, performance concerns etc. on moving to 7.3 from 7.2 ? (I am on Kubuntu 10.10 btw)
16:48  iaj: one question - do you guys use supertab ??? or do you <C-x>completion modes to get the job done.. and C-n C-p basically
16:49  TAsn-work: iaj, the latter.
16:50  iaj: TAsn-work: for the usual keyword completion from the current edited buffer - which one do you use? C-p then?
16:51  zematynnad: iaj: I prefer autocomplpop
16:51 --- scottschulthess_ is now known as scottschulthess
16:51  TAsn-work: I just c-x c-o (Added a mapping)
16:51  xilo: iaj: i use supertab
16:51  iaj: zematynnad: what's autocomplpop?
16:51  xilo: i use supertab with neocomplcache
16:52  zematynnad: xilo: I never could get noecomplcache to work correctly for me - I'll have to try it again sometime
16:52  ezzieyguywuf: woah. what is a .vba? now way of transporting plugins?
16:52  malfy: what is the $ symbol for in vim?
16:52  xilo: ezzieyguywuf: vbas have been around for a long ass time
16:52  ezzieyguywuf: malfy: end-of-line
16:52  iaj: zematynnad: oh.. that plugin shows ALL completions all the time?
16:53  zematynnad: iaj:  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1879
16:53  xilo: zematynnad: you can pretty much copy the config settings on the neocomplcache page
16:53  malfy: ezzieyguywuf: no like when you pass it to a function
16:53  malfy: like someFunc('$')
16:53  zematynnad: xilo: I'll try it again today
16:54  xilo: only thing i haven't figured out is how to get it to stop trying to search through every freakin #include in C/C++ and just use a tag file
16:54  zematynnad: iaj: it doesn't stop your typing in anyway, as you type it either narrows the choices or if it no longer matches the popup goes away
16:55  iaj: zematynnad: isn't it kinda annoying to see the choices all the time?
16:55  ezzieyguywuf: malfy: ah. dunno.
16:55  zematynnad: iaj: not at all
16:55  zematynnad: iaj: but to each his own
16:56  TAsn-work: Hey guys, I'm using omnifunc to auto-complete c syntax, but unfortunately, I can't auto complete stuff like foo->bar->a because it only tries completing according to the type of foo, is there any plugin/whatever to solve that?
16:56  TAsn-work: retry ^ :P
16:56  Silex: TAsn-work: use clang_complete instead? :)
16:56  TAsn-work: and since we move to a similar topic, I figured, why not :P
16:56  TAsn-work: Silex, /me is googling, mmnt.
16:56  Silex: TAsn-work: https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete
16:57  TAsn-work: thanks.
16:57  zematynnad: any opinions on 7.3 vs 7.2 before I start building...
16:57  zematynnad: anyone *using* 7.3?
16:58  mgedmin: 7.3 rules
16:58  mavvert: zematynnad: yes.
16:58  xilo: when was 7.3 released
16:58  xilo: hrm long time ago
16:58  zematynnad: August 15
16:59  xilo: stupid ubuntu can't update repos
16:59  mgedmin: eh?
16:59  zematynnad: right - so building from source
16:59  mgedmin: http://askubuntu.com/questions/7283/where-can-i-find-vim-7-3
16:59  xilo: i hate ubuntu man
16:59  mgedmin: don't use it then
16:59  xilo: i kind of have to if i want to use linux at work
17:00  xilo: since the company software i need only has rpms
17:00  xilo: er
17:00  xilo: rpms and debs
17:00  zematynnad: mgedmin: thanks for the link
17:00  zematynnad: mgedmin: do you know which options that one has?
17:01  zematynnad: huge, python, ruby etc?
17:01  mgedmin: probably the same as regular ubuntu vim packages
17:01  zematynnad: ok (pretty much everything) :)
17:01  mgedmin: I built mine from sources, because there was no ppa at the time
17:01  mgedmin: protip: don't enable both ruby and perl at the same time, you'll get segfaults
17:02  mgedmin: ruby + python seem to work fine
17:02  zematynnad: right
17:02  exDM69: http://e-werk.entropy.fi/~riku/vim-broken.png   updating my display adapter drivers did not fix this problem. I also am unable to get any sort of video memory corruption happen. Gvim is the only software with this kind of issue
17:02  exDM69: what text renderer does vim-gnome use?
17:03  strull_: perl + python also w/o problems (here)
17:03  schmrz: Hello Everyone!
17:04  schmrz: Can anyone tell me how to close the omnicompletion preview window ?
17:04  LeoNerd: Er... I'm running vim-full from Debian, and that has  +perl +python +ruby
17:04  LeoNerd: Works for me
17:05  mavvert: exDM69: what graphics adapter are you running ?
17:05  exDM69: mavvert: an integrated nvidia card
17:05 * zematynnad is now on 7.3
17:05  mgedmin: exDM69, gui_gtk2_draw_string() uses gdk_draw_glyphs()
17:06  mgedmin: after clearing the area with gdk_draw_rectangle()
17:06  exDM69: mgedmin: do you know which other apps use the same text rendering?
17:06  mgedmin: all gtk apps?
17:06  mgedmin: although vim is special in that it doesn't use double-buffering, I think ...
17:06  mgedmin: at least it doesn't feel like it would be using double-buffering
17:07  exDM69: okay
17:07  exDM69: this bug is really really bad, makes gvim practically unusable
17:08  mavvert: exDM69: did you try the 'nv' driver ?
17:08  exDM69: mavvert: the opensource one? no
17:08  exDM69: I have nvidia-current from ubuntu repos

17:12  xilo: eclim seems to not like 7.3 tho
17:14  mavvert: exDM69: i'd give the nv driver a shot... just to see if it helps
17:15  mgedmin: yay, 7.3.071 apparently fixes the "scrollbind doesn't go away after I switch to a different buffer in a diff window" bug I saw a while ago
17:15  mavvert: exDM69: did you try running gvim as a new user ?
17:15  zematynnad: xilo: so for neocomplcache do you need to (or should you) have SuperTab and AutoComplPop installed?
17:15  mavvert: exDM69: eg.. no preferences, special settings etc
17:16  xilo: zematynnad: neocomplcache replaces autocomplpop
17:16  xilo: you don't need supertab, but it's a nice addition
17:16  zematynnad: xilo: cool thanks
17:17  xilo: zematynnad: have you tried suptertab+autocomplpop+snipmate?
17:18  _overflow_: someone? plz help.
17:18  _overflow_: Im using 7.2.445 and when I execute :browse e, it returns "No file name" and don't show anything
17:18  zematynnad: xilo: I used to use supertab but right now I prefer just autocomlpop and snipmate
17:18  xilo: i've tried using supertab+neocomplcache+snipmate
17:18  xilo: but all 3 together don't play nice lol
17:18  zematynnad: :)
17:21  zematynnad: _overflow_: does :E work?
17:21  _overflow_: zematynnad: yes... :o
17:21 * _overflow_ didn't know :E command
17:21  zematynnad: :)
17:21  _overflow_: zematynnad: but why :browse e (or tabnew) doesn't work?
17:21  zematynnad: not sure
17:22  _overflow_: :(
17:22  xilo: _overflow_: do you even have a file manager installed
17:22  _overflow_: it was ok until I upgrade (from debian lenny to squeeze)
17:22  _overflow_: xilo: ... I mean vim file manager
17:23  _overflow_: xilo: the same that uses :E command
17:24  xilo: ic
17:29  zematynnad: _overflow_: Do you get the same thing with vim -u NORC
17:33  elventails: any way I can highlight similar sentences? (not just one word, e.g. with * ) but a whole sentence?
17:34  Silex: elventails: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1599
17:34  Silex: didn't try it tho
17:35  elventails: Silex: thanks - checking it out
17:35  Silex: hum, not sure it'll do what you want tho
17:35  mgedmin: elventails, http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_for_visually_selected_text works for me -- select a bit of text, press *
17:35  elventails: Silex: basically, I figured it would be handy if the editor would highlight any duplicated code
17:35  elventails: mgedmin: thanks - checking that too
17:36  mgedmin: hey, it got complicated since the last time I saw this
17:36  mgedmin: my vimrc has just two lines
17:36  mgedmin: vnoremap * y/\V<C-R>=substitute(escape(@@,"/\\"),"\n","\\\\n","ge")<CR><CR>
17:36  mgedmin: vnoremap # y?\V<C-R>=substitute(escape(@@,"?\\"),"\n","\\\\n","ge")<CR><CR>
17:36  elventails: mgedmin: thanks - will grab what you have too - and compare with the what's online
17:37  mgedmin: the online version probably handles more corner cases
17:38  mgedmin: woohoo, getreg(), getregtype() and setreg() are very interesting functions I didn't know about
17:38  mgedmin: this channel is educational
17:40  elventails: Silex, mgedmin: sweet! thanks!
17:41  Silex: mgedmin: nice, /me puts mapping vimrc
17:42  thebishop: is there a plugin for getting itemized compiler errors that can be quickly accessed?  Maybe using Ctags?
17:42  GnuBoi: I want to use the http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=88 vimtips plugin but it says You must download the tips separately, and it links to a wiki site. How to use vimtips ?
17:43  Silex: thebishop: the plain quickfix window?
17:43  TAsn-work: Silex, just wrote about clang complete, and noticed a major flow
17:43  TAsn-work: flaw*
17:43  TAsn-work: Known Issues:
17:43  TAsn-work:  - If clang is not able to compile your file, it cannot complete
17:43  TAsn-work:  anything.
17:43  TAsn-work: sucks...
17:43  Silex: TAsn-work: well, do you often write code that doenst' compile?
17:43  TAsn-work: while working with it
17:44  TAsn-work: it may not compile
17:44  TAsn-work: ...
17:44  Silex: TAsn-work: in my experience only major wrong code makes clang_complete fails
17:44  TAsn-work: i.c
17:44  TAsn-work: ok, I will try that.
17:44  TAsn-work: (tomorrow though)
17:44  TAsn-work: thanks.
17:44  TAsn-work: cya (maybe) tomorrow.
17:44  Silex: yw
17:45  elventails: mgedmin: p.s: the version on link you sent is "nicer" than the one you have in your .vimrc cause it also ignores whitespaces
17:45  Silex: thebishop: FuzzyFinder has :FufQuickFix which shows a menu with the compile errors, then you just select which one and press enter to jump to it
17:45  elventails: mgedmin: so I tried, yours, then updated to that one
17:46  thebishop: Silex, thanks, both of your suggestions look promising.

17:52  Silex: mgedmin, elventails: found this https://github.com/thinca/vim-visualstar

17:58  kish: suddenly hilights dont show anymore
18:02  exDM69: pffft, I'm really pissed off about the text rendering issue I had with vim. although the actual bug is probably not in the vim code, but vim was the only one that made it occur. The lack of double buffering might be a plausible explanation
18:02  elik: kish: there is usually an element of transition
18:03  kish: umm wat
18:03  elik: kish: a cause, if you will
18:03  mgedmin: exDM69, yeah, it sucks
18:03  mgedmin: what workarounds have you tried?
18:03  exDM69: I was actually going to do something today, now I wasted all day trying to get this working
18:03  mgedmin: e.g. switching between compiz and metacity?
18:03  exDM69: I tried updating the drivers
18:03  exDM69: and I tried vim-gnome and vim-gtk
18:03  exDM69: didn't try compiz
18:03  mgedmin: I don't suppose nv binary drivers have any relevant xorg options about enabling/disabling various accel modes
18:04  exDM69: I also tried another display adapter but that didn't work at all, so I didn't even get vim running
18:04  mgedmin: vim inside gnome-terminal is an option ...
18:04  exDM69: yeah, gotta use vim in terminal until I get a new computer at work
18:04  exDM69: I must also learn some new keybinds then, f.ex. I don't know how to resize windows in vim with the keyb. How do you do that?
18:05  elik: kish: when did transition from the "working" state to the "not working" state
18:05  zomg: exDM69: window stuff works with ctrl+w, manual probably has more info
18:06  exDM69: zomg: which :help page?
18:06  exDM69: :help windows has something
18:07  exDM69: C-w and +-<> resize
18:07  mgedmin: exDM69, you can configure console vim so it's nearly indistinguishable from gvim
18:07  mgedmin: e.g :set mouse=a -> then resize your windows with the mouse
18:07  zomg: exDM69: yep :help window should have a list of window-related commands if you scroll down a bit
18:08  exDM69: mgedmin: thanks, that works great
18:09  elik: kish: does it suddenly highlight again?
18:11  kish: elik, well it hilights certain files, those it can identify belonging to preset rules
18:11  kish: but it is not hilighting this iptables file with no extension
18:12  kish: and if my memory serves me, it was hilghted in the past
18:14  FernandoBasso: kish: What happens if you :set filetype=sh ?
18:15  kish: nothing. the file extension isn't sh though
18:17  c3l: is it possible to change a definition in a plugin without editing the plugins files? for example: call tcomment#DefineType('c',                '/* %s */'         )
18:17  c3l: ops, well yes, to change that
18:17  c3l: just call tcomment#Def... wont work
18:17  deryni: Calling it again doesn't override the setting?
18:17  FernandoBasso: kish: Could ou show the text of your file?
18:18  FernandoBasso: kish: Look http://imagebin.org/126922
18:18  c3l: deryni: simply :call tcom... nope, do I have to reload something for the effects to kick in?
18:19  deryni: I don't know anything about tcomment really. Does the documentation talk about setting up your own comment strings/settings?
18:20  c3l: deryni: not that I've found.. maybe I should ask some tcomment person. but would something like :calle foo .. generally work? or is the definition somehow local for the plugin, and not accessible globally?
18:20  xilo: ugh new chromium blows
18:20  Ecco: really ? Why ?
18:21  xilo: my scrollbars keep getting corrupted on 8 stable
18:21  deryni: c3l: You can't modify that line without modifying that line, that's not even a sensible thing to try to do. The question is does tcomment let you set/override custom comment formats.
18:21  c3l: deryni: oh! it worked for undefined filetypes, but not changing the an already existing..
18:22  deryni: Right. So the question is if you can change or override one of the default ones.
18:22  c3l: I just typed :call tcomment#DefineType('arduino', '// %s' )  from vim's command prompt, or what I should call it
18:23  c3l: deryni: yes, sorry for not being clear, I dont really know what im talking about, quite new to this :)
18:24  bronson: tpope, is there a way to have the Rails plugin aways on?  If I'm editing a gem file, I'd like Rmodel to navigate the last-used Rails environment, rather than just not existing at all.
18:24  bronson: Possible?
18:34  Rypervenche: Would anyone be able to help me convert a dictionary text file from one format to another? It's rather simple, but I don't know how to type it out in vim.
18:34  complete: Hey People! When I create a new buffer with :tabnew and then want to save it in a certain directory - is there a way to activate a directory browser to find the directory?
18:36  xilo: how do i get neocomplcache to use a ctags file?
18:38 --- jpease1 is now known as jpease
18:39  Rypervenche: Can someone help me make this happen? I'm trying to convert a text file. This is what I need to happen for all of the entries, http://pastebin.com/g6JLgGuG
18:41 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
18:42  bronson: Rypervenche: two substitutions?  :%s/ /|/   then   :%s/ /^M/    (where ^M is Control-V Return)
18:43  Geralt: Hi, I'd like to navigate a function list that is created with ctags -x --c-kinds=+f some_file.c via quickfix, but I'm not sure how the errorformat should look, can you help me?
18:44  complete: In VIMs file browser, is it possible to create new files or directories?
18:44  exDM69: complete: yes, shouldn't it have the help on the top?
18:45  Rypervenche: bronson: I need to remove the space between the characters (sometimes more than 2, sometimes less) and replace it with a |, then I need the space after the characters removed and the rest put onto a new line, then I need the space after the pinyin turned into "<br>"
18:45  exDM69: complete: oh no, I might be mistaken
18:45  exDM69: complete: I can only see delete and rename there
18:46  Rypervenche: bronson: Oh, and I need a line between each entry.
18:47  complete: exDM69: it says "<F1> help" but F1 gets intercepted by Gnome. So I cannot reach it.
18:47  bronson: Rypervenche: so use /  */ to match one or more spaces (note 2 spaces before *).  :he regexp for more.
18:47  bronson: complete: that's easy to turn off: keyboard shortcuts, help, click on the shortcut, and hit delete.
18:48  bronson: now F1 is under your control.
18:48  mtvee: can anyone recommend an auto complete plugin for ({" etc. i'm using autoclose.vim but it's not really doing what i need
18:48  bronson: ... or vim's.
18:49  exDM69: complete: same here
18:49  exDM69: complete: works for me in gvim, tho
18:49  complete: bronson: "keyboard shortcuts" in gnomes system settings? i found that, but i dont see "help" there.
18:49  complete: exDM69: i use vim over ssh.
18:50  bronson: complete: sorry, I'm on my mac now, going from memory.  I think it's "Launch Help Browser" or someting.
18:50  bronson: Also, come to think of it, gnome terminal intercepts F1 too, but you can turn that off in its preferences.
18:50  complete: bronson: yes, there is "launch help browser", but thats alread deactivated.
18:50  complete: bronson: aaahh!! let me see...
18:51  complete: bronson: hmm.. i cannot find a setting for F1 in gnome terminal.
18:52  bronson: complete: it's hidden in some tab or something...  I can look in 1/2 hour.
18:53  complete: bronson: i looked closely through all tabs. cannot find anything.
18:53  bronson: dunno, maybe check all menus.  it's in there somewhere.  :)
18:53  complete: bronson: oh! it looks like its in the menu!
18:53  complete: i had the menu disabled
18:55  complete: wooohooo it works!
18:55  complete: bronson: thank you
18:55  bronson: np
18:57  complete: phu... there are a billion commands in the file browser
18:58  complete: i wonder if it can create new files
18:58  mgedmin: %
18:59  Rypervenche: bronson: Ok, this is working great for me, I just need one last thing. Because there are spaces between the brackets, how can I tell it to replace the space that is after what is in the brackets?
18:59  complete: mgedmin: hmm.. im not sure. i created a new buffer with ":tabnew", then typed some stuff. now i would like to navigate to a directory and save the new file there. do you know how i would do that?
19:00  mgedmin: :saveas new/directory/name/filename.txt
19:00  mgedmin: maybe :browse saveas would work?
19:00  mgedmin: not in a console
19:00  bronson: Rypervenche: not understanding...  example?
19:01  complete: mgedmin: well, i dont want to type new/directory/name. thats the problem
19:01  complete: mgedmin: i would like to browse to new/directory/name and then do "save here as lalala.txt"
19:01  mgedmin: you could open netrw, navigate, then hit 'c' to chdir, and then switch back to the new file and :saveas newfile.txt
19:01  complete: ok, let me try that.
19:02  mgedmin: or you could use gvim and :browse saveas
19:02  Rypervenche: bronson: "stuff here [pin3 yin3] /definition/" I need to replace the space after the ] with "<br>"
19:02  _sc_: make sure you have 'noautochdir' if you do that
19:02  complete: mgedmin: i use vim over ssh. i dont like gvim.
19:03  complete: mgedmin: what do you mean with "open netrw"?
19:03  mgedmin: netrw is the plugin that implements :Explore
19:03 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
19:03  mgedmin: i.e. the file browser
19:04  bronson: Rypervenche: s/ ]/<br>/   ?
19:05  complete: mgedmin: ok, and after i did "c", how do i "switch back to the new file"? I mean, how do I exit :Explore?
19:05  mgedmin: ctrl-^ should work
19:05  Rypervenche: bronson: Close, but I need to keep the bracket, I just need the space after it replaced. so it comes out "stuff here [pin3 yin3]<br>/definition/"
19:06  bronson: s/ ]/]<br>/
19:06  complete: mgedmin: "ctrl-^"? whats that? never used a key combo like that.
19:06  complete: mgedmin: do you really mean "^"?
19:06  mgedmin: :h CTRL-^
19:06  Rypervenche: bronson: Ah...it's so simple, ahha. Thanks a lot. I'll try that out :D
19:06  complete: mgedmin: "sorry, no help fro CTRL-^"
19:07  mgedmin: that's unpossible!
19:07  complete: oh!
19:07  complete: i used + instead of -
19:07  complete: ok. lets seee...
19:07  complete: strange..."edit the alternate file"
19:07  complete: that sounds strange.
19:07  complete: dont i just want to quit explore?
19:08  mgedmin: the bit about "quick way to switch between two files" is most accurate
19:08  mgedmin: ... if you think of the file explorer as a file
19:08  mgedmin: it's a buffer, really
19:08  mgedmin: and ctrl-^ is a way to switch between buffers
19:08  mgedmin: :bd might work to quit the explorer
19:08  Rypervenche: bronson: Oh, it worked perfectly. Just a last quick question. how can I put a new line between each entry? Since I don't need to replace anything, I'm not sure how to go about adding it.
19:09  bronson: Rypervenche: s/$/^M/  ?
19:09  complete: mgedmin: hmmm.. ok. will experiment with that a bit.
19:10  singlecore: dudes
19:11  singlecore: i wanna map <F2> in insert mode to normal mode's gUiw ... is that possible?
19:11  mgedmin: yes, see :h :imap
19:12  mgedmin: and :h i_CTRL-O
19:12  singlecore: kk thx
19:13  Rypervenche: bronson: It worked! Thank you so much!! I've been trying to figure this out for soooo long, and it turned out to be so simple >< I'm going to be learning more about vim. It's extremely useful.
19:14  bronson: Rypervenche: right on.  look up a regex tutorial on the web too, they're handy everywhere.
19:14  mgedmin: only be aware that vim has its own regex dialect, documented in :h pattern
19:14  Rypervenche: bronson: Will do :)
19:14  Rypervenche: Ok, I'll check them both out.

19:34  kukman: How to load runtine vim plugin?
19:35  cafaro: When I want to boot Ubuntu from my CD, I get "BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!", and my system completely stalls. I already tried "acpi=off" and "noapic". Any ideas?
19:35  v0n: I don't understand why my `set statusline+=%{Rvm#statusline()}' doesn't work. Any idea?
19:35  rson: cafaro: wrong channel
19:35  rson: v0n: define "doesn't work"
19:36  telemachus: v0n: Are you sure the rvm.vim script is loading?
19:36  cafaro: whoops, sorry.
19:36  telemachus: also which version are you using?
19:36 * telemachus has a fork of it
19:36  v0n: rson, == has no effect on my statusline
19:36  fow: kukman, if 'rtp' is set correctly, just :runtime plugin/foo.vim or whatever. See :h 'rtp' and :h :runtime
19:36  v0n: telemachus, I know you have a fork ^^ but I don't know if it is loaded :s
19:36 --- lover is now known as saba
19:37  rson: v0n: is it in :scriptnames ?
19:37  v0n: rson, yep
19:37  telemachus: one reason I ask in all seriousness is that at one point the function was Rvm#statusline() but in other versions it's rvm#statusline()
19:38  v0n: telemachus, I tried both
19:39  telemachus: v0n: Ok, is rvm.vim in the output from :scriptnames?
19:39  v0n: telemachus, yep
19:39  telemachus: v0n: set ls=2?
19:39  kukman: Can I see, if plugin is loaded? I can't run debugger
19:40  kukman: I press F5, but nothing
19:41  seku: :scriptnames
19:42  kukman: Yes. debugger.vim is in lis
19:42  kukman: list
19:42  v0n: telemachus, yep, I've got it now
19:42  telemachus: Ah, awesome
19:42  telemachus: :)
19:43  v0n: I should add this before my rvm#statusline so? What was the problem?
19:45  telemachus: v0n: Yes, you want to include that in your .vimrc before you call for rvm#statusline
19:45  c3l: when I source my vimrc, certain plugins and mappings stop working, why is that?
19:46  telemachus: See :help laststatus
19:46  telemachus: v0n: And maybe take a look here http://www.guckes.net/vim/setup.html (for general setup tips/explanations)
19:47  v0n: telemachus, is that possible to enable this status only for Ruby files?
19:47  v0n: (thanks btw)
19:47  telemachus: I'm currently using this as a status line - https://gist.github.com/733700
19:47  telemachus: v0n: Yes, you want the *other* function rvm#statusline_ft_ruby()
19:48  telemachus: that only shows your Ruby when you're editing a ruby/rake/etc/ file
19:48  telemachus: I actually prefer that as well.
19:48  telemachus: v0n: You're welcome
19:51  kukman: My vim without python support. Do I need to recompile it ?
19:51  telemachus: Only if you want python support
19:51  kukman: Yes. It need to debugger support
19:51  kukman: Verification has("python") fails
19:52  telemachus: Yup. I was half-kidding, but I suspect the answer is yes. It's a compile-time option. I don't believe you can enable it after the fact.
19:52 --- danslo_ is now known as danslo
19:53  kukman: ok. I'll try to recompile
19:54  exDM69: do you guys use supertab? or do you have other setup for insert mode completion?
19:55  exDM69: I'm not entirely satisfied with having to choose the type of completion I want
19:56  mgedmin: kukman, installing a distro package with python support enabled might be simpler, if you don't want to recompile
19:56  kukman: mgedmin, yes. I've fixed this problem ( as you say )
19:57  mgedmin: exDM69, I use the regular keyword completion (^p/^n); combined with a tags file that lets me complete any identifier in the project I'm working on
19:57  mgedmin: filename (^x^f) completion sometimes comes in handy too
19:57  exDM69: mgedmin: some language modes (ie. haskell mode) have a great omnicomplete, I don't want to miss on that one
19:57  exDM69: filename complete is a special case (for me) and I can choose that separately
19:57  mgedmin: yeah ... python's omnicomplete isn't exactly brilliant
19:58  exDM69: atm I'm experimenting with using supertab but mapping it to ctrl-space instead of the usual tab key
20:03  telemachus: exDM69: I don't like it much myself, but some people swear by snippets.vim
20:04  telemachus: Not quite so much tab-completion as semi-automation of common things. Anyhow, some people love it.
20:04  mtvee: exDM69: i have this in my .vimrc, can't rem where i found it tho, http://vim.pastey.net/143751
20:05  singlecore: how do i capitalize the word under the cursor without any movement?
20:06  telemachus: Hey, can I ask while this is sort of on-topic: what's with the uppercase function names? Vim's documentation and some tutorials I've read seem to swear that all functions should be lowercase starting. No?
20:07  c3l: when I source my vimrc after some changes or w/e, certain plugins and mappings stop working, how can I fix that? upon restart of vim it works again..
20:09  c3l: I have :set nocompatible ..
20:10  exDM69: telemachus: I don't use so much languages where that would be useful
20:10  exDM69: telemachus: it's very nice to complete a for loop, but not so much for coding in haskell
20:11  exDM69: mtvee: looks decent
20:11  exDM69: I'd perhaps like something that tries omnicomplete first, then syntax complete and finally local keyword complete
20:11  exDM69: I guess that wouldn't be so hard to do with pumvisible()
20:12  exDM69: I think I don't want to use tab for my insert completion, tho
20:12  exDM69: supertab is quite alright but it breaks my <S-Tab> deindent and <C-Tab> for change tab
20:13  exDM69: now I have <C-space> mapped to supertab but then I get a darn tabulator inserted if there are no completions
20:14  telemachus: exDM69: Fair enough
20:27  exDM69: what was the key to add the key symbol in insert mode. e.g. when editing my .vimrc and adding keymappings, I press ctrl-S and I want it to insert <C-s>
20:28  Raimondi: exDM69: <C-V>
20:28  exDM69: Raimondi: no, that's not it
20:28  exDM69: I actually stumbled upon it just a second ago
20:29  lucs: exDM69: Um, and what was it?
20:29  ws: exDM69:  I think it's <C-V> in linux/UNIX/Mac and <C-Q> in windows
20:29  acx0: is there a built-in variable which holds the name of the filetype being edited?
20:29  Raimondi: &filetype
20:30  exDM69: lucs: I don't know what it was, I pressed it by accident
20:30  lucs: Oh :)
20:30  Raimondi: acx0: :h :let-&
20:31  Raimondi: exDM69: If you press some keys in insert mode, Vim will insert that instead.
20:32  exDM69: <C-v> does not do the trick
20:32  exDM69: oh actually it does, but only in gvim
20:32  acx0: Raimondi, thanks
20:32  exDM69: wonder what it is in console
20:33  seku: exDM69: do you mean trigraphs?
20:33  Raimondi: exDM69: It's the same, but I guess your terminal doesn't pass those/handle the keys you need.
20:33  exDM69: trigraphs?
20:34  seku: umm... dunno if i got it right ;) was it... ctrl b? not sure
20:34 --- Maletor_ is now known as Maletor
20:36  seku: nevermind :D i don't know what im talking about
20:40  Dynetrekk: is there a command to open all folds in a file?
20:40  Dynetrekk: like zO, but for all folds at the same time
20:40  deryni: zR
20:40  deryni: Which is a (large) handful of entries down in the help from zO.
20:42 --- Silex is now known as silex
20:44  Dynetrekk: deryni: oh, thanks. I should get better at reading the :h stuff I suppose
20:45  deryni: In general look around the help for the command/option/etc. you know to find related commands/options/etc.
20:45  deryni: The vim help is generally well organized like that.
20:45  Dynetrekk: deryni: I know, but I still haven't quite got my mind around it. I keep learning though :)
20:45  Dynetrekk: deryni: I have nearly never before seen a program with a help function that is actually helpful like vim's :P
20:45  exDM69: I'd like to do this: map <C-t> to go-to-tag instead of ^] and <S-C-t> to go-back instead of <C-t>. How do I make this happen, I tried with imap and inoremap but I get weird errors
20:47  deryni: What did you try and what "weird errors"?
20:48  exDM69: imap <S-C-t> <C-t>   inoremap <C-t> <C-]>
20:48  exDM69: also other combinations of imap/inoremap
20:50  Raimondi: exDM69: Those are normal mode commands
20:51  exDM69: Raimondi: that explains it
20:54  exDM69: but mapping <S-C-t> to go back (<C-t>) does not work, it thinks I press <C-t>
20:55  deryni: That's probably true. It probably doesn't generate a different sequence. See what <c-v> reports for both of them.
20:55  exDM69: damnit
20:56  exDM69: I really don't like vim's model of mapping keybindings to other keybindings
21:01 --- silex is now known as Silex
21:04  exDM69: I'd need to find sane keybindings for tag navigation
21:04  exDM69: trying to type ^] on a finnish keyboard is next to impossible
21:05  exDM69: I need to press ctrl-altgr-9 to get that key. It's like using emacs or playing classical guitar or both at the same time
21:05 --- altamic_ is now known as altamic
21:16 --- Silex is now known as silex
21:24  c3l: exDM69: the keyboard designers seem to hate nordic countries, same problem in sweden ;)
21:24  exDM69: http://www.saunalahti.fi/janij/blog/images/2008_jun_finnish_keyboard_layout.png
21:24  exDM69: c3l: finnish and swedish layout is the same, isn't it?
21:26  exDM69: http://www.mail-archive.com/vim_use@googlegroups.com/msg02043.html
21:26  c3l: exDM69: oh, I thought you guys had some more funny-looking characters =)
21:26  c3l: (not much finnish culture in sweden)
21:26  seku: xmodmap <3
21:26  exDM69: c3l: no, we have less
21:26  kongo: exDM69: you could map one of the special characters like ö, ä to ctrl-]
21:26  exDM69: c3l: we don't use the å letter at all
21:26  seku: å is not a finnish character
21:26  seku: its swedish o
21:26  exDM69: kongo: good idea
21:27  kongo: exDM69: that's what I do with my german keyboard layout
21:30  exDM69: kongo: yeah, I think I'll have to invent a good use for those keys
21:30  exDM69: kongo: can you map <C-ä>, etc?
21:31  exDM69: the answer is: no
21:31  kongo: exDM69: I don't think so. I think I have a normal mode mapping to ä, ö ...
21:31  exDM69: noremap <C-ä> iääliö<Esc> " does nothing
21:32  maxxe: hm don't know how to describe this in less than one line.. is it possible to do this in vim.. if i write this:
21:32  maxxe: printf("",
21:32  maxxe:        "");
21:32  maxxe: is it possible to automatically move it to there?
21:32  maxxe: the second line
21:33  kongo: maxxe: you probably want to read in :h cinoptions-values
21:33  c3l: I like the english layout much much more than the swedish, maybe one could figure out some way of getting the 3 stupid letters in there somehow. that way Ill still stay compatible with real keyboards. I used colemak for a while, its great when at my computer, but I slowly forgot qwerty ;)
21:33  maxxe: kongo: ok thanks gonna read
21:34  deryni: US international layouts should have compose or dead keys which would let you get those characters.
21:36 --- WebDragon|away is now known as WebDragon

21:47  mcantor: Is this the right place to ask for help on certain plugins, like VCSCommand?
21:47  homekevin: mcantor: It can't hurt.
21:47  homekevin: Unless we hurt you.
21:48  homekevin: But we (probably) won't.
21:48  acx0: I might
21:48  acx0: just kidding
21:48  mcantor: homekevin: I dunno; last time acx0 started throwing stuff at me...
21:48  mcantor: ;-P
21:49  mcantor: I want a quick way to view the diff between HEAD and HEAD - 1 on a file.  Does VCSCommand have a good way to do this, without manually looking up and copy-pasting the rev numbers?
21:54  mcantor: Also, what's the "right way" to set plugin variables like VCSCommandEnableBufferSetup?
21:55  mcantor: I tried setting it in a buffer with :let VCSCommandEnableBufferSetup=1, then doing :e to reload the buffer, but it didn't populate the VCSCommandBufferInfo variable isn't being set.
21:55 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
21:56  acx0: mcantor, for plugin variables, I would try putting it in your .vimrc
21:56  mcantor: acx0: The docs mention that it can be set on a per-buffer basis
21:57  robacarp: which register is the null register? _?
21:57  Raimondi: yes
21:57  mcantor: robacarp: Yup!

21:58  vimgor: mcantor: Error: No closing quotation
21:58  mcantor: Well, buzz off then!
21:59  acx0: are there any coding conventions for vimscript? for example, for variable names, are underscores preferred over camelCase?
21:59  fifou: hi. I had no answer here : http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/browse_thread/thread/6fc3fdf7e271cffe?hl=en# I'm afraid of disturbing community with this subject so I prefer asking in a chan : do you think this problem is a real one?
22:00  mcantor: acx0: I'm unaware of any community-wide conventions for that sort of thing.
22:00  exDM69: are there any other fellow finns or swedesh using the finnish/swedish keyboard layout with vim? I'd like to see what sort of keymappings you use.
22:01  mcantor: exDM69: Is there a big difference between American QWERTY and the finnish/swedish layout?
22:01  exDM69: mcantor: yes, enormous
22:01 --- fmw_ is now known as fmw
22:02  mcantor: fifou: :mksession does some very unusual things; it has surprised me before, too.
22:02  exDM69: mcantor: all the letters are in the same places, but there are 3 extra letters, two "dead keys" for accents, umlauts and tildes and pretty much all special characters are numbers with either a shift or altgr modifier
22:03  exDM69: mcantor: http://frontype.com/keyboarding/540px-Computer-keyboard-Sweden.svg.png
22:03  exDM69: mcantor: now imagine what you have to do to type ^] for go-to-tag
22:03  mcantor: exDM69: Yikes.  Hmm... why does having *more* keys pose a problem, though?
22:03  mcantor: Ohh, I see.
22:03  fifou: mcantor: mksession should not add 'arg my_buffer' in the script because I :bwipeout it before ! And I checked with :ls that is is not present
22:03  mcantor: exDM69: I'm having a similar problem on my smartphone, which has no built-in keys for []<>.
22:03  exDM69: mcantor: there's only one more physical key
22:03 --- dive is now known as Guest99541
22:04  mcantor: fifou: It's possible that :mksession is pulling it from the arglist instead of the buffer list.
22:04  exDM69: maybe I should start a stackoverflow on this one
22:04  mcantor: exDM69: Seems more appropriate for superuser to me, for some reason
22:04  mcantor: Though it'd probably get great response on either.
22:04  fifou: mcantor. this is what is done, I checked in source code
22:04  exDM69: mcantor: I want a vim setup for programming
22:04  fifou: could I remove a file from arglist?
22:05  mcantor: fifou: Then, I would almost say that the problem is with the drag 'n drop behavior--maybe drag & drop should modify the buflist and not the arglist.
22:05  mcantor: exDM69: Makes sense!
22:05  mcantor: exDM69: I had to give up on dvorak because of a similar issue.
22:06  exDM69: although you get pretty proficient with these strange chords you have to type when coding. you also get a carpal tunnel syndrome
22:06  fifou: mcantor : I'd prefer that, indeed
22:06  mcantor: exDM69: Kinda my problem :-|
22:06  fifou: your analysis seems right, I will add a message on mailing list
22:06  mcantor: fifou: Good luck!
22:06  robacarp: I run with dvorak, didn't change the keymapping around at all....the only thing that is a bit awkward is the basic movement, but I've gotten used to that
22:07  fifou: thank you =) see you mcantor
22:07  mcantor: robacarp: I think the problem is that I used vim for too long before trying to switch to dvorak.  Stuff like "ggVGd", "gqip", etc. are drilled into my muscle-memory.
22:07  DHulme: vimgor: ggVG
22:07  vimgor: ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence.
22:08  robacarp: what does ggVG do?
22:08  mcantor: Well, that's no good!  vimgor ought to explain why.
22:08  mcantor: robacarp: Visually selects the entire file.
22:08  robacarp: huh.
22:08  robacarp: well I'll be...
22:09  mcantor: robacarp: The key knowledge is "gg" and "G", which are both quick jumps to the top and bottom, respectively.
22:09  robacarp: yea, sure, I see that in there
22:10  DHulme: mcantor: if you want ggVGd (for example), ggdG has the same effect and is shorter
22:10  robacarp: I tried doing some programming in python with vim the other day and decided I need to know more about different indenting patterns in vim...
22:10  DHulme: the same is true for almost any normal-mode command you'd run from visual mode
22:10 --- MikhX_ is now known as MikhX
22:11  DHulme: and if you want to get the :'<,'> stuff for running a command on the selection, you're still quicker avoiding visual mode and just using :%
22:11  mcantor: DHulme: That's an excellent point.  I think I sometimes prefer the "V" if only because my frail brain is reassured by the visual representation of what I'm about to do.
22:11  mcantor: DHulme: I never do ggVG:, though.  :% is the obvious use case there.
22:12  mcantor: Not sure why my brain views ggVG: and ggVGd differently.
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor: ggVG is <reply> ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. Use ggxG instead where x is the operator you want to use, for example ggdG instead of ggVGd. To run a command on a selection use :%
22:12  vimgor: ... but ggVG is <reply> ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. ...
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor: forget ggVG
22:12  vimgor: Okay, rudi_s.
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor: ggVG is <reply> ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. Use ggxG instead where x is the operator you want to use, for example ggdG instead of ggVGd. To run a command on a selection use :%
22:12  DHulme: of course, for that example :%d does just as well and is even shorter
22:12  vimgor: Got it!
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor:
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor: ggVG
22:12  vimgor: ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. Use ggxG instead where x is the operator you want to use, for example ggdG instead of ggVGd. To run a command on a selection use :%
22:12  rudi_s: vimgor: forget ggVG
22:12  vimgor: Okay, rudi_s.
22:13  rudi_s: vimgor: ggVG is <reply> ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. Use ggxG instead where x is the operator you want to use, for example ggdG instead of ggVGd (or even better :%d). To run a command on a selection use :%
22:13  DHulme: rudi_s: you mean "to run an ex command on the whole file"
22:13  vimgor: I hear ya!
22:13  rudi_s: DHulme: Ah, you're right of course.
22:13  rudi_s: I'll fix it, thanks.
22:13  DHulme: I like the "of course". Nice touch.
22:14  rudi_s: ;-)
22:14  rudi_s: vimgor: ggVG
22:14  vimgor: ggVG is an almost completely useless command sequence. Use ggxG instead where x is the operator you want to use, for example ggdG instead of ggVGd (or even better :%d). To run a ex command on the whole file use :%
22:14  rudi_s: DHulme: I hope it's okay now ;-)
22:15 * mcantor gazes in silent awe at the very brain of omniscient vimgor being molded before him
22:15  exDM69: what does - do in normal mode? is there a default action?
22:15  exDM69: my kb layout has - where the us layout has /
22:16  mcantor: exDM69: ":he -"
22:16  exDM69: same as k?
22:16  mcantor: exDM69: By default, asking for help on any keystroke will show you what it does in normal mode.
22:17  exDM69: I feel somewhat constrained by what keys can vim recognize in terminal
22:18  exDM69: <C-S-t> and <C-t> are indistinguishable

22:21  mcantor: seku: I map normal C-U to it.
22:22  mcantor: xilo: You can probably get started with :mksession.
22:23  xilo: ah yeah
22:23  xilo: thanks
22:23  mcantor: Hey, does anyone know what my VCSCommand issue might be?  I keep setting the "VCSEnableBufferblahblah" variable in one of my buffers, but for the life of me, I can't get the buffer info variable to load.
22:23  mcantor: xilo: np
22:24  mcantor: xilo: Also: Keep your important dotfiles in version control ;-)
22:24  xilo: i HAD them in version control
22:24  xilo: then i deleted the repo cause i realized i had passwords in there and i don't have private acct
22:24  mcantor: So, svn revert?
22:24  mcantor: Ahhh.
22:24  mcantor: makes sense.

22:34  acx0: is it possible to cast the value returned from input() to int?
22:37  acx0: nevermind, it seems to do it automatically (the vim doc said input() returns a string)
22:38  kongo: acx0: there is str2nr()
22:39  acx0: kongo, thanks, will keep that in mind
22:40  pielgrzym: hi
22:41  pielgrzym: can i somehow run multiple commands at onces in command (:) mode? separated? Like %s/foo/bar ; w ; bn
22:41  DHulme: see :help :bar
22:41  rsvp: noticed that :w! could change permissions and owners -- so thought of safer version, ":w  !sudo tee %" -- however, it does wait properly for the admin password, your suggestions ???
22:42  pielgrzym: DHulme: thanks
22:42  homekevin: rsvp: There are options to control how saving is done.
22:42  DHulme: rsvp: My suggestion is to use sudoedit instead
22:43  homekevin: Yeah, you shouldn't use Vim under sudo
22:43  rsvp: s/does wait/does NOT wait/
22:44  homekevin: rsvp: What's the problem?
22:44  rsvp: homekevin, so how do you edit config files owned by root ?
22:44  homekevin: rsvp: sudoedit
22:46  homekevin: rsvp: Make sure your $EDITOR environment var is set to the editor you want to ues.
22:46  homekevin: *use

22:49  xilo: mcantor: i did the save session, extracted the GUI parts and now starting gvim gives error while connecting to session manager: none of the authentication protocols specified are supported
22:50  homekevin: Is there a way to include non-printable characters in string options with the :set command?
22:51  xilo: nvm
22:51  xilo: that's from my screwed up settings
22:51  homekevin: Er, without having to include non-printable characters in my .vimrc, I mean.
22:53  rsvp: sudoedit is fine if you knew beforehand that the permissions have to be overriden -- in my case, one has already made extensive changes to the file and wants to redirect the modified buffer back to the file. [sure, one could save to a tmp file and come back with sudoedit -- looking for elegant solution within vim ;-]
22:53  homekevin: rsvp: OK, but what's wrong with what you posted in that case?
22:55  rsvp: homekevin, vim does not pause to let the user enter the sudo password -- somehow it keeps trying on its own -- which I find very perplexing.
22:55  c3l: I found the plugin AutoComplPop quite nice, however its quite frustrating getting the first completion suggestion into the buffer, it seems I have to press tab, then shift-tab to get it in, as its pre-selected (but not inserted obviously). how is it intended to be used? tab+shift-tab isnt very nice. I couldnt find anything
22:56  homekevin: rsvp: So it's impossible to enter the password?
22:57  c3l: rsvp: :w !sudo tee %  ?
22:57  homekevin: c3l: That's the command we're discussing.
22:57  rsvp: homekevin, yes, and yes to c3l.
22:58  rsvp: did you guys try it out ??? and see the oddity
22:59  c3l: ah, I see. never heard of your issue. for me it works fine, it asks for my sudp password, and somehow writes the file outside of vim, requiring me to reload the file, thats ugly.. but works :)
23:00  homekevin: rsvp: Works fine for me. Is this in a terminal or in gVim?
23:00 --- robacarp is now known as not_a_fish
23:00  rsvp: gvim
23:00  homekevin: That's probably the problem.
23:00  c3l: works for me
23:01  rsvp: why would gvim v. vim make a difference here?
23:01  c3l: we call !sudo, calling a command doesnt depend on terminal vim or anything like that
23:01  homekevin: But some programs require a tty
23:01  homekevin: Especially programs that ask for passwords
23:02  c3l: ive never encountered anything like that, but all password programs ive run is sudo, which at least works for me in gvim
23:03 --- not_a_fish is now known as robnotacarp
23:03  homekevin: When I try it in gVim it doesn't wait for a password, delays for a few seconds and re-prompts, and stops after 3 attempts.
23:04  Raimondi: Same on MacVim.
23:05  rsvp: so it works fine on vim, but not on gvim, for me.
23:06 --- dive is now known as Guest68221
23:11 --- robnotacarp is now known as robacarp
23:12  rsvp: homekevin, really curious about the reason behind "gVim it doesn't wait for a password, delays for a few seconds and re-prompts, and stops after 3 attempts" -- why is it even interacting without our say so ???
23:13  homekevin: rsvp: I'm not sure what you mean
23:13  homekevin: rsvp: I think it's checking whether its input is a tty and giving up when it finds that it isn't, but I'm not sure.
23:14  rsvp: homekevin, the 3 attempts were made without our knowledge
23:19  mcantor: Here's a mystery: Is there a way to make vim intelligent about auto-indent changes when you're using RST in your Python docstrings?
23:21  iaj: is there someone here happening to use XPTemplate?
23:25  homekevin: Please just ask your question, rather than asking if there's someone you can ask.
23:27  iaj: homekevin: well I dunno where that's coming from I try to define my own snippets so I dunno if the problem is being caused because I use pathogen since the folder where I store the personal snippets is ~/.vim/bundle/xptemplate/personal/ftplugin/java.xpt.vim instead of ~/.vim/personal/ftplugin/java.xpt.vim
23:28  iaj: and if someone could share his own xpt.vim file so I can see if its a problem with my file or not
23:33 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
23:34  iaj: ok so now I moved the folder directly into my ~/.vim... but that's not changing anything :(
23:38  mcantor: Dang.  How about making vim intelligent about auto-formatting docstrings, period?
23:39  viking: what's the option to make vim display current cursor position in normal mode?
23:39  viking: that is, position coordinates
23:39  deryni: :he 'ruler or 'statusline ?
23:39  fow: the first one, 'ruler'
23:40  deryni: The statusline can do it as well, and is significantly more configurable.
23:40  viking: ty
23:40  viking: for some reason, the position went away
23:40  viking: not sure when
23:40  fow: ah
23:41  viking: i might've changed something in my .vimrc by mistake
23:42  viking: ah, there it is
23:46  iaj: oh vim can't handle symlinked directories correclty in my case :\
