08:32  jorrit: Hi
08:38  d1b: morning how can i make vim remove 4 spaces / an indentation level as it would with a tab?
08:38  d1b: for a python file
08:38  d1b:  / code
08:40  fow: d1b, set sts=4 sw=4
09:13  dimm: hello guyz!
09:14  Raimondi: Hi, dimm
09:17  dimm: how it will look in vim?
09:17  dimm: %s/^[0-9]+\.//g
09:19  dimm: i want to delete xx. at start of line. 'xx' it is a digit, or digits (it meant '1.' or '10.')
09:19  Raimondi: for one or more numbers escape the + and it's faster to use \d instead of [0-9]
09:20  Raimondi: The global flag is unnecessary, you will have only one match per line.
09:20  Raimondi: :%s/^\d\+\.//
09:50  d1b: fow: got it already
10:08  Basie: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790 ... do both python.vim and python3.0.vim go in syntax directory?

10:32 --- aep_ is now known as aep
11:00  dimm: how i can say to vim about start of file and end of file ?
11:01  dimm: something like ':s/^/<table>/'    and  ':s/$/<\/table>/'      but for end and start of file
11:01  DHulme: :help start-of-file
11:02  DHulme: though if that's all you want to do with them perhaps :0insert foo and :$append foo might be what you want
11:06  mhi^: How can I say "last buffer (or window) opened"? In fact I open a file in a preview window. But if the previous focused window was holding a help page for example, the contents of the preview are read-only.
11:06  mhi^: That's why I always want to set it to 'modifiable' if opened.
11:07  DHulme: I don't understand your question.
11:08  mhi^: If you open a preview window, you don't focus it. How do I set it 'modifiable' though?
11:11  DHulme: what are you trying to achieve by making it modifiable?
11:11  mhi^: Ehm.. well, so I can modify it? :-P
11:12  DHulme: if you're going to do that, why are you using a preview window?
11:14  mhi^: Because I liked the approach that a preview window doesn't get modified. Also.. If you have one file open and a preview, a ":q" will close Vim. If you have a normal split. :q will one quit the current window.
11:14  mhi^: Ehm.. doesn't get focused.
11:15  Fandekasp: hi
11:15  mhi^: I'll just do it with 'wincmd p'
11:15  Fandekasp: When I :vs, I get 2 pages on my screen. I'd like to switch their position (the left page would go at right), how can I do this ?
11:16  mhi^: Fandekasp: :h window-moving
11:17  Fandekasp: thks mhi^
11:19  Fandekasp: very nice ^^
11:20  DHulme: Fandekasp: if you want it to always open a new window on the other side, try the 'splitbelow' and/or 'splitright' options
11:20  dimm: how i can use multiple regexp in vim? something like ' sed  -e <regexp1> -e <regexp2>'
11:20  Fatih`: Fandekasp, just do c-w, c-x
11:21  Fandekasp: yes Fatih` just saw it in the doc :)
11:22  Fandekasp: thks DHulme for the tip
11:23  avinashhm: hi, i am having a table whose coloums are jumbled ... [ http://paste.ubuntu.com/537827/ ]... I can search for a special character  from where it is jumbled .. Can i some how make that special character to start from a specific coloumn .. In this example , search for '[' and make it start from coloumn 30 in each line ..is there any such possible way ???
11:25  DHulme: avinashhm: %>30c in a pattern matches anywhere after column 30
11:26  avinashhm: DHulme, i wan't to match a character and make it to move to column 30 ..
11:27  DHulme: It sounds like you want a Perl script or similar.
11:28  avinashhm: DHulme, oops ... no way to do it in vim :-( .. any pointers what i can search in perl will also be helpful :-)
11:29  DHulme: I'm not saying there's no way to do it in Vim, only that since Vim is a text editor whereas Perl is designed for exactly what you're trying to do, you'll probably find it quicker in Perl.
11:29  avinashhm: DHulme, ok's ... i ll dig it ... thanks DHulme
11:31  avinashhm: DHulme, with '/[.*' , i am able to select all the text from that character to the end of the line ... i only need to move the whole thing so that it starts from a specific coloumn .. there should be some way ...let me check
11:32  qfr: Does anybody happen to know the color code for the background color at the end of the file, behind the last line?
11:33  mhi^: qfr: NonChar
11:33  mhi^: ehm.. NonText
11:33 --- silex is now known as Silex
11:34  qfr: Ah thanks, it worked
11:38  bassliner: is there a way to implement session comprehensive undo in vim? e.g. so that after writing a file and quitting vim and then later on loading it again in vim i can undo things? thanks!
11:39  DHulme: only if you have Vim 7.3
11:40  avinashhm: hi, how we can go to a specific coloumn .. ex :30 , takes me to 30th row , similarly for 30th coloumn .. anything there ??
11:41  mhi^: 30|
11:41  avinashhm: mhi^, awesome .. thank you
11:42  mhi^: (you can also use (30G) to jump to a certain line, BTW.)
11:42  DHulme: or 30gg if you hate shift ;
11:42  mhi^: No idea why I wrote parentheses around them ;)
11:42  DHulme: that ; was supposed to be ;)
11:43  avinashhm: :-) ... these are good tips ... saves shift and :'s ... thanks guys
11:43  mhi^: Hah, didn't know about 'gg' in this case either ;>
11:44  Silex: gg or G is still two keys to press :)
11:44  Silex: but G feels more acrobatic
11:46  Silex: I hear a lot of people remap capslock to esc... and it's complicated because it needs OS support etc. Why don't they remap § instead?
11:46  Silex: because capslock is closer?
11:46  avinashhm: Silex, helps if your k/b has lost shift keys :-) ...[although it becomes pain in other times ]
11:46  fow: Many people can't type § :P
11:46  Silex: I mean the key just above tab
11:47  Silex: the console key in quake
11:47  Silex: :)
11:47  avinashhm: :-)
11:47  jdhoreOTG: tilde/backtick
11:47  Silex: ah, I guess on some keyboards you don't want to lose tilde/backtick
11:47  fow: I use backtick/tilde a lot >_>
11:47  Silex: fair enough
11:53  mhi^: Silex: Also, most sane people rather map it to Control, not Escape.
11:54  Silex: mhi^: not capslock you mean
11:55  Silex: gotta go, brb in 1h I'll ask you later about it :)
11:55  mhi^: Silex: No, I meant they map CapsLock to send the same sequence then Control. ;)
11:55  mhi^: Not Escape.
11:56  cirwin: why?
11:57  mhi^: Because there a lot of shortcuts using Ctrl.
11:57  cirwin: ok
11:58  cirwin: true, if you include terminals I'm not sue which I use most
13:21  siddhion: hey, does anyone here have experience with vim netrw ftp plugin?
13:24  siddhion: I am trying to figure out how to connect to my server via FTP but netrw is very confusing.
13:26  DHulme: siddhion: what have you tried so far?
13:28  siddhion: DHulme, Well I wanted to make it easier to get into my server and browse for files. So I was searching for the .netrc file but could not find one in my home folder. I then decided to create a nre .netrc file and add 'machine example.com login myname password 'mypassword'
13:29  siddhion: I do not know what to do next
13:29  DHulme: well, have you tried opening a file over ftp?
13:31  siddhion: DHulme, yes. I should have mentioned that I tried 'gvim ftp://myname@example.com/index.html' and I recieved an error
13:31  DHulme: what error would that be?
13:33  siddhion: gvim pops up with 'Error - .netrc file not correct permissions.Remove password or correct mode (should be 600).You aren't logged inftp: bind: Address 'already in use
13:34  siddhion: DHulme, I am wondering if I have the right info in my .netrc file
13:35  DHulme: sounds like your .netrc file doesn't have the correct permissions
13:35  DHulme: you need to use chmod on it
13:37  siddhion: DHulme, so I would do 'chmod u+x .netrc' ?
13:37  DHulme: no
13:37  siddhion: ok
13:37  DHulme: chmod go-a .netrc
13:37  DHulme: you don't want to make it executable
13:38  siddhion: is the -a there for finding the invisible .netrc file ?
13:39  siddhion: DHulme, I tried it and it says 'Try `chmod --help' for more information.'
13:40  DHulme: use chmod go-rw .netrc instead, then
13:45  siddhion: DHulme, ok I actually found something on a forum that said to do 'chmod 600 .netrc'. I write 600 because my error stated that the correct mode should be 600. after I did that and tried connecting to the server to edit a file I got a new error
13:47  siddhion: The error is 'Login authentication failed. Login failed. You aren't logged in. ftp: bind: Address already in use '
13:48  siddhion: DHulme, I then did 'chmod go-rw .netrc' on it, tried connecting via 'gvim ftp://user@example.com/index.html' and gvim opened with the same error I posted just above.
13:49  DHulme: and can you login using the same ftp client that Vim is using?
13:50  siddhion: DHulme, I am not using an FTP client with gVim though. I thought this was all built into VIM in the netrw plugin that comes with 7.2
13:51  DHulme: netrw just uses whatever ftp client it finds on your system
13:51  siddhion: DHulme, you mean netrw uses what ever ftp client it finds on my web host servers system?
13:52  DHulme: no, on the machine you're running Vim from
13:52  DHulme: if you go to the command line and run "ftp user@example.com" what do you get?
13:52  siddhion: DHulme, ahh ok. Well I am on Ubuntu 10.04. I am not sure what FTP client it uses.
13:53  siddhion: I get 'ftp: user@example.com: Unknown host' and then the Terminal prompt changes to 'ftp>'
13:54  reezn: Hi, when i select block with strg-v (for example do add # to 10 lines) and then press "I" im not able to insert in block mode. I always end up in normal insert mode... what am i doing wrong?
13:56  DHulme: reezn: there isn't a "block insert mode"; just type the text you want and then press escape
13:57  reezn: ahh ok... it does not insert live. After pressing escape its fine
13:57  reezn: thanks
13:57  DHulme: siddhion: I mean you should use the same username and hostname that you were using inside Vim
14:00  siddhion: DHulme, oh I know. I just typed in 'user@example.com' to keep my information safe
14:01  DHulme: looks like your ftp client doesn't understand user@host syntax
14:03  siddhion: DHulme, well yesterday before creating the .netrc file,  I was able to connect to the server via 'gvim ftp://user@example.com/index.html'
14:06  Silex: why does <Esc> go back one char?
14:06  Silex: if I'm in the middle of a line, pressing i<Esc>i<Esc>i<Esc> goes back to the beggining eventually
14:07  DHulme: Silex: when you're in insert mode, your cursor is in between two chars, but when you're in normal mode, your cursor is on a char
14:09  Silex: DHulme: so I'd just get used to it?
14:09  Silex: :>
14:09  DHulme: if you use a instead of i, the cursor stays in the same place
14:10  siddhion: DHulme, Ok. I got it gVim to connect to my server. First I deleted the .netrc file. Then I did 'gvim ftp://user@example.com/public_html/index.html'. So now we know I can connect. Now how do I make it so I can set the path to browse the files in the path 'user@example.com/public_html/'?
14:11  DHulme: I don't understand. What do you mean, "set the path to browse the files"?
14:12  iaj: siddhion: just drop the index.html and netrw will go to that directory?
14:12  DHulme: is :e user@host/public_html/ what you want?
14:15  siddhion: iaj, Ok that is right. When I do that I see gVim pop up with a sort of rudimentary file browser with all my directories
14:19  siddhion: DHulme, when I do ':e user@host/public_html/' I see an error at the bottom of gVim that says 'Illegal file name 0,0-1'
14:19  DHulme: sorry, I mean ftp://user@host/public_html/
14:19  siddhion: DHulme, oh never mind I did not add the 'ftp://' to the front of it
14:20  siddhion: DHulme, so how would I know take this and automate the process of getting access to the Vim netrw file browser screen?
14:21  DHulme: automate in what way?
14:21  siddhion: I ask this because typing 'ftp://user@host/public_html/' and the password every time seems ridiculous. You know?
14:23  DHulme: well, either get an ftp client that supports the .netrc thing you tried before, or you could put the username and password in your .vimrc as described in :help netrw-password
14:31  siddhion: DHulme, ok but how will I invoke the file browser  from within gVim?
14:31  DHulme: the same way
14:31  DHulme: :e ftp://host/public_html/
14:31  siddhion: DHulme, so everytime I will have to run that line?
14:31  siddhion: I was looking for a more streamlined way...like some bookmark style technique where I would not have to type that path out everytime.
14:31  siddhion: You know DHulme
14:31  DHulme: you could always add an alias in your shell so "browsewebsite" becomes "vim ftp://host/public_html/" or something
14:31  DHulme: yes, I know DHulme; he's a handsome chap, and really friendly
14:31  siddhion: DHulme, Oh that sounds like a good idea. HA!
14:31  siddhion: DHulme, Do you use FTP or SFTP ? Which would you recommend?
14:31  DHulme: I can't say I use either very much, but when I do I use sftp for privacy.
14:33  DHulme: If you want an ftp browser with bookmarks and stuff, why don't you just install an ftp browser that has bookmarks and stuff?
14:35  jeltsch: Hello, I want to improve autoindentation for lists.
14:35  Fatih`: Is there any option to apply the  . command multiple lines ?
14:35  Fatih`: like 3dd
14:35  jeltsch: I currently have this: set formatlistpat=^\\s*\\([•–*-]\\)\\s*
14:35  DHulme: Fatih`: yes, the obvious way
14:35  DHulme: oh, multiple *lines8
14:35  iaj: siddhion: I did a mapping eg. <leader>q brings me to my website's fileadmin directory which I often need for changing files in for my work.
14:39  DHulme: Fatih`: the easiest way's probably to record a macro
14:39  jeltsch: First question: Is there a way of getting rid of those double backslashs?
14:39  Fatih`: DHulme, can I do that with the . command ?
14:39  jeltsch: E.g., of writing \s instead of \\s?
14:39  fow: jeltsch, :let &flp = '...'
14:39  siddhion: iaj, ok, so mappings take place in the .vimrc, correct? if so how would this mapping look?
14:39  jeltsch: fow: What’s the difference between let and set? Do I have to use let in order to use single quotes?
14:39  Fatih`: DHulme, the . command make the changes on the same line
14:39 --- ekneuss_ is now known as ekneuss
14:39  DHulme: Fatih`: record a macro with .j and then run that macro as many times as you like
14:39  fow: jeltsch, let uses an expression and sets variables. set only sets options, but options can be used like variables by prepending a & to the option name (short or long)
14:39  Fatih`: DHulme, ok
14:40  jeltsch: This doesn’t work as expected: set flp=a\\|b
14:40  jeltsch: This one does: let &flp='a\|b'
14:40  jeltsch: Why is this?
14:41  fow: jeltsch, you need te escope both the backslash and the |, more reason I prefer :let in this case :)
14:41  fow: *to escape
14:41  iaj: siddhion: yeah - vimrc could be a place or a file you source from within your vimrc... for me a line like map <silent> ,q :e ftp://www.server.com/httpdocs/fileadmin/<CR>
14:41  iaj: does.
14:45  siddhion: iaj, I added this mapping to my .vimrc (except my path was obviously different) and then loaded up gVim but I do not see the expected file browser
14:45  iaj: after hitting the mapping? should be the same as ,q  in my case
14:47  siddhion: iaj, so mapping essentially maps the command ' :e ftp://www.server.com/httpdocs/fileadmin/' to the key 'q'?
14:47  siddhion: if so perhaps I will change that key and try again :)
14:47  iaj: to the keysequenz ',q' 
14:48  iaj: :map ,q should give you the mapping as well.
14:48  siddhion: iaj ok i see. yes it work. so where do you store your username and passowrd?
14:49  iaj: got a file .netrc in my homedirectory
14:49  iaj: http://www.mavetju.org/unix/netrc.php  take a look here
14:50  siddhion: .vimrc or .netrc?
14:50  iaj: .netrc...
14:56  siddhion: iaj, oh sweet! it works a trick!
14:59  siddhion: my problem was that i had the password in quotes because that is how the netrc documentation showed it. like this machine HOSTNAME login USERID password "PASSWORD". anyways, thanks a million
15:02  iaj: siddhion: your welcome.
15:05  siddhion: iaj, so do you think using FTP is safe?
15:14  burhan: is there a way to know which preferences file vim is reading?
15:14  burhan: I have some things in ~/.vimrc but these are not being honored when I launch vim
15:16  et: which things?
15:16  DHulme: :scriptnames lists all the files Vim has executed, in order
15:16  DHulme: and :verbose set someoption tells you where someoption was last set from
15:19  burhan: set syntax=on
15:19  Silex: how do I paste register content without executing it?
15:19  Silex: I recorded a macro
15:19  Silex: and I want to send it over to a friend over irc :)
15:20  Silex: so he can do smth like let @a=blabla
15:21  iaj: shouldnt a simple <C-r>[register you used for storing the macro] in insert mode print the whole macro?
15:22  kurkale6ka: ^r^r" or "...p
15:23  iaj: is there any way to have something like tail -f achieved in vim? eg that it automatically reloads the file>

15:41  Silex: how do I write ^A without actually pressing ^A? I'm trying :exe 'normal i<C-a>' but it doens't work
15:41  Silex: the goal is to use vim's increment feature

15:44  Silex: thanks!

16:33  darkwise: any one has already use vim with stin stout ? on  script  for example ?
16:33  gkatsev: cat foo.txt | vim -  ?
16:34  darkwise: yes something lie this, in fact I have a script with : echo $VAR | vim +"some options"
16:34  darkwise: an after some system updates
16:34  darkwise: s/an/and
16:36  darkwise: I have : Vim: Error reading input, exiting..
16:37  darkwise: the complete command :  echo "test" | vim  +"runtime! syntax/2html.vim" +"w" +"qall"
16:37  gkatsev: you need the - in there to read from stdin
16:38  darkwise: ok thanks gkatsev
16:38  DHulme: and w won't work if you don't give it a filename
16:38  gkatsev: don't see why it would
16:38  darkwise: yes sure ;)
16:41  Silex: is there a random numbers facility in viml? :h :rand or :h :random doens't find anything
16:43  mhi^: Silex: nope
16:43  Silex: shame
16:43  mhi^: you could do a oneliner using one of the supported scripting languages, though
16:44  Silex: yeah but it's hacky to depend on those
16:44 * mhi^ nods
16:45  Silex: it'd be possible to use the time as the seed
16:45  gkatsev: you could check from win/*nix and read in a random from the shell
16:45 --- mixandgo_ is now known as mixandgo
16:46  Silex: ah, found this http://pastebin.com/HgguD77t
16:47  Silex: probably a very bad generator but well, good enough for my case
16:47  hgimenez: In a function using search() with a regexp pattern containing a capture, how do I access the match? \1 does not work
16:48  gkatsev: Silex: heh
16:48  spiiph: hgimenez, perhaps submatch( ?
16:48  hgimenez: ex: http://pastie.org/1332583
16:48  hgimenez: i'll investigate submatch...
16:48  hgimenez: on that paste, it does not return anything
16:49  Silex: how do I repeat an ex command a number of times?
16:49  spiiph: hgimenez, ah, but doesn't search return a list of matches?
16:50  Silex: e.g say I want to do :normal "cwkeke\<Esc>dwj" 10 times without using a macro?
16:50  hgimenez: not sure
16:51  spiiph: hgimenez, I think :h searchpos( is a better function to use
16:53  hgimenez: I need the function to return any word characters following the previous def. Looks like searchpos is just finding the line and column positions
16:53  gorthaur: Silex:  :h @:  perhaps
16:53  Silex: gorthaur: yeah, but taht requires me to split it in two commands
16:53  gorthaur: Silex, ah ok. Then I don't know
16:54  Silex: it'd be nice if I could simply send one line to copy paste into an ex command to my friend over irc
16:55  Silex: maybe I'd turn it into :let @a=blabla | 25@a
16:55  Silex: instead of ex commands chained with |
16:55  pngl: Why would "nnoremap <Tab> <Esc>" disable jump in? (<c-i>) Note: it does not disable <c-o>
16:56  darkwise: vim
16:57  darkwise: sorry :(
16:57  spiiph: pngl, because <Tab> _IS_ <C-i>
16:58  LeoNerd: Joy!
16:58  LeoNerd: Another one of these....
16:59  pngl: spiiph: ha. Ok. How do I keep the ability to jump in while using the tab key as an <esc> replacement?
16:59  spiiph: You don't.
17:00  pngl: spiiph: that's harsh :)
17:00  spiiph: Well, I guess you could xmodmap or edit the registry if you're on Windows.
17:00  spiiph: But there's no way to do it in Vim.
17:00  pngl: spiiph: no, I'm on linux
17:00  spiiph: xmodmap, then.
17:00  pngl: spiiph: thanks.
17:01  spiiph: (I think that should work.)
17:01 --- Silex is now known as silex
17:01  skonek: is it possible to remove a single entry(last entry) from vim history?
17:03  turre_: pngl: maybe try using caps lock as ctrl and map <c-j><c-k> and vica versa as esc?
17:04  peth: skonek: see :help histdel()
17:10  zenzike: I'd like to cut all lines in a file that start with foo in my file, and paste them at the end of the file. Is that possible in vim?
17:10  pngl: turre_: Not sure if that's what you meant but I decided to use <c-k> in insert mode as <Esc>. I already had Caps as Ctrl.
17:10  d0m: When I add a new file, I don't see it with CommandT. Is there a way to "refresh" the directory? (I've googled but hardly found anything)
17:11  _rane: :CommandTFlush or something
17:11  _rane: :Comm<tab>
17:12  strull: zenzike: try :g/^foo/move $
17:12  zenzike: can you really put a move in a substitution?
17:13  zenzike: oh that's clever. thanks.
17:14  jerojasro: zenzike: :g is not substitution. It does something (what you put after the final /) to the lines that match the pattern (regexp) you gave it. see :help :g
17:14  zenzike: thanks jerojasro :-)
17:16  d0m: thanks :)
17:18  skonek: peth: thanks
17:19  et: iaj: i don't use any compiler settings - i compile manually, and my pdfviewer automatically updates
17:20  iaj: et: thanks - which pdfviewer is that?
17:21  et: preview.app ;) so probably not of much use to you ... but i recall evince or kpdf doing the same
17:22  iaj: et: awh.. thanks.. well yeh Im on osx as well.. do you happen to know on howto manually install the \usepackage{foo}  stuff?  I've been using macports for gaining tetex.
17:24  binjured: quick setting i'm having trouble with: i want to map "jump to tag" (<C-]>) to <M-]> ... the obvious incantations just disable both from working.
17:24  et: i use texlive
17:25  iaj: et: and do you happen to know on how to install some packages?
17:26  et: iaj: well, the same with any other tex installations, either install the ports package (if existing), or put it somewhere and use $TEXMF etc
17:27 --- Natch is now known as Natch|
17:37  iaj: et: can you gimme an example of such a package
17:56 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
17:56 --- mixandgo_ is now known as mixandgo
18:12 --- WebDragon|laptop is now known as WebDragon
18:16  RingZer0: Any idea how to make vim's find-and-replace work like php regex?
18:16  RingZer0: i have such troubles using vim regex
18:16  sacho: why would you want to do that?
18:16  RingZer0: sacho: familiarity
18:17  sacho: and what is unfamiliar to you?
18:17  RingZer0: well, i would like to do s/href=\"(*)+\"/href=""/g
18:18  RingZer0: or the "one or more" syntax.
18:18  RingZer0: also the "number of occurances" { }
18:18  RingZer0: and also the "grouping" with ()
18:19  RingZer0: the grouping really has me screwed up
18:19  sacho: :help pattern lists all of those
18:19  Raimondi: RingZer0: :h /\v
18:20  RingZer0: i do not understand the term branch
18:20 --- silex is now known as Silex
18:20  RingZer0: (except when use with cvs')
18:22  RingZer0: adom, piece, multi, branch :S  (new vocab)
18:22  RingZer0: oh, adam == grouping
18:22  RingZer0: i see, () has to be escaped?
18:22  homekevin: RingZer0: :h /\v
18:24  homekevin: RingZer0: All those terms are defined in the help, using a BNF-like syntax.
18:24  homekevin: RingZer0: E.g., :h /branch
18:25  RingZer0: so using magic via \v is the closest to php
18:26  RingZer0: so, how do i make that permanent?  :set magic \v
18:26  graywh: you can't
18:26  homekevin: No, you can't.
18:26  iaj: isn't there some way tho?  I thought I read a hint about that one, once.
18:27  homekevin: RingZer0: The "one or more" syntax is the same as pretty much all regex: +  It may or may not need a \ depending on magic.
18:27  homekevin: With \v it's just +
18:28  Silex: Can someone figure why vim flashes with the 2nd line but not with the 1st one? http://ideone.com/aHAhS
18:28  RingZer0: I guess my question is: how can i make my vim always use \v type of magic when using any find operation?
18:28  Silex: I tried to rewrite the 1st line into the 2nd one in a shorter way
18:28  Silex: both works, but the 2nd one flashes the screen white while running
18:30  homekevin: I don't know Silex, but I'm wondering why you exec constant strings and move to the bottom of the file when you are already there.
18:31  Silex: homekevin: I'm not already there?
18:31  Silex: homekevin: this is basically meant to be run on http://ideone.com/5SSvG
18:31  Silex: it's for a friend, he needs to copy the block and increment by 25 the -400 for each line
18:32  Silex: then repeat that until +400, which is done by 30@:
18:32  homekevin: Well, G moves to the bottom. What does GG do?
18:33  strull: homekevin: yG does not move the cursor
18:33  Silex: ah wait, it flashes with the 1st line too actually :>
18:33  homekevin: OK, I take it back. :)
18:34  strull: Silex: what is this 7k stuff? are you having that much lines?
18:34  RingZer0: doesn't . mean anything?
18:34  Silex: basically on, http://ideone.com/5SSvG I do yGGp to copy the block, which leaves me on the copied block on the -400
18:34  RingZer0: does . encompass (\n or \r or \r... or \s) ?
18:35  Silex: then I do from current line to the end do 25^A to add 25
18:35  Silex: then I do 7k to go back to the 1st number so it's ready for the next yGGp
18:35  homekevin: RingZer0: . matches everything except end-of-line.
18:35  Silex: strull: I'm all ears if there's a better way
18:35  homekevin: Similar to nearly all regex systems.
18:37  RingZer0: homekevin: i want to clear out all css rules in a sheet, but maintain the selectors
18:37  RingZer0: this works for all inline style: :%s/\v\{.+\}/{}/g
18:38  RingZer0: 2 problems though:  1. even tho I :set magic... i still have to use \v to be able to correctly match... I want that to be default without having to always type \v
18:38  homekevin: RingZer0: You'll have problems with that. It'll eat all the {} it can.
18:38  strull: Silex: I'm not completely following you. Maybe a mark is appropriate here
18:38  homekevin: RingZer0: 1 is by design.
18:39  RingZer0: homekevin: then why does :%s/\{.+\}/{}/g match nothing and :%s/\v\{.+\}/{}/g match and replaces successfully 387 results
18:39  RingZer0: it appears as though :set magic is like using \m
18:39  homekevin: RingZer0: Yes, that's exactly right.
18:40  RingZer0: well i want :set magic \v
18:40  homekevin: Sorry, not in Vim.
18:40  RingZer0: homekevin: does that make since?
18:40  Silex: strull: http://ideone.com/5SSvG, the goal is to write a one-liner that duplicates the block N times and increments the -400 each time by 25, ending like http://ideone.com/8G5mL
18:40  RingZer0: that sucks, so I always have to type \v ....
18:40  homekevin: RingZer0: It makes sense, it's just not something Vim can do.
18:40  ehc: what tricks do you use to move about code when you want to go up or down faster than just one line at a time with h or l? For example, if I set a mark at the func delcaration, and then want to get down to the middle of the function, I find myself pressing h and bunch of times
18:40  RingZer0: that is a bummer that there is a set for it, but can't specify the type since there are 2.
18:41  Silex: ehc: maybe ^M
18:41  homekevin: RingZer0: Well, it's a boolean option.
18:41  Silex: ehc: otherwise, check ^D and ^E
18:41  homekevin: magic or nomagic.
18:41  RingZer0: ehc: b (beginning of word) e (endo of word) $ end of line ^ start of line
18:42  Silex: ehc: } also helps jumping "paragraphs"
18:42  ehc: Silex, hmm, let me try those out, maybe the paragraphs will work. what is a paragraph in terms of code?
18:42  RingZer0: yeah, bracket jumping
18:42  homekevin: RingZer0: The simple way to do what you want would be to use non-greedy repetition operators.
18:43  Silex: ehc: whatever forms a "lbock"
18:43  Silex: *block
18:43  ehc: Silex, yeah, { does the trick
18:43  RingZer0: homekevin: what do you mean?
18:43  homekevin: RingZer0: %s/\v\{\_.{-}}/{}/g
18:44  homekevin: Almost that.
18:44  homekevin: RingZer0: %s/\v\{\_.{-}\}/{}/g
18:44  homekevin: So, \_. matches anything including end-of-line.
18:44  RingZer0: homekevin: learned something new :)
18:44  homekevin: {-} matches any number of the preceding, but as few as possible
18:45  ehc: Silex, when you say ^M do you mean actually ^ followed by M or is that short for something else?
18:45  RingZer0: homekevin: and you are using {} to group?
18:45  Silex: ehc: I'm trying to find them back, but there's one to tell "go to middle of screen"
18:45  homekevin: RingZer0: However, this is still not going to work with embedded {}.
18:45  Silex: I thought it was Ctrl-M
18:45  Silex: but apparently it's smth else
18:45  homekevin: RingZer0: No, I'm not.
18:45  RingZer0: homekevin: so why not (-)?
18:45  RingZer0: oh... nvm...
18:45  ehc: Silex, go to middle of screen is M
18:45  homekevin: RingZer0: Because that doesn't mean anything.
18:45  RingZer0: that is the count of
18:46  RingZer0: i understand
18:46  Silex: ehc: :D
18:46  RingZer0: homekevin: so you are using a {0} rather than * or +
18:46  RingZer0: oops s/0/-
18:47  ehc: Silex, Ctrl-M just goes down one line at a time.
18:47  homekevin: RingZer0: Yes. It's similar to *? in some regex systems.
18:47  ehc: I think its a virtual line instead of a screen line or vice versa
18:47  RingZer0: thanks a lot homekevin :)
18:49  rindolf: Hi all.
18:49  Silex: ehc: I was thinking of M
18:50  Silex: strull: ignore my problem, I fixed it
18:50  ehc: Silex, okay. so is ^M shorthand for Ctrl-M ?
18:50  ehc: Silex, also just found Ctrl-D Ctrl-U for up and down a page
18:51  Silex: ehc: yeah, along wiht ^E/^Y
18:51  Silex: ehc: yeah a common notation for ctrl-x is ^x or <c-x>
18:52  ehc: Silex, okay, yeah I knew about <c-x> but wasn't sure about ^x
18:53  Silex: is tehre a shortway to write .,$-1 for the range from current line to last line minus one?
18:55  bsod1: how can I delete to the end of line? dd deletes all of the line
18:56  spiiph: D
18:56  bsod1: spiiph: thanks
18:56  Silex: ha, I shortened it to exe "normal yGGp7:normal 50\<C-A>\r06k" \o/
18:57  spiiph: In #vim, <C-x> usually means the key combination CTRL+x, whereas ^X usually means the character.
18:57  spiiph: It's a useful distinction.
19:03  rson: does vimscript have a "pass" statement of some sort that will break me out of an if-elseif-else block?
