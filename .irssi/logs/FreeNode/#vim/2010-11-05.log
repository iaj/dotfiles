13:04  spiiph: kurkale6ka, I think you might have to read the source code even. I'm not sure I've created any <Plug> mappings
13:05  kurkale6ka: spiiph: ok, no pb, btw, Are you going to add the hasmapto in the code because I really miss my <backspace> for deleting :)
13:05  heeen: thelogicdump: I have
13:06  thelogicdump: What did you think of it ?
13:06  spiiph: kurkale6ka, sometime, when I have time to work on it, which means not in the forseeable features. :(
13:06  heeen: well... I develop on the mozilla source and for cross compilation
13:06  _rane: how do i create an empty buffer without specifying a filename?
13:06  heeen: so it was a bit of a hack to set up
13:07  heeen: I had to parse the gcc flags from a make invocation
13:07  heeen: and filter out -I, -D and -include
13:07  heeen: _rane: :e
13:08  _rane: "E32: No file name"
13:08  strull: _rane: :enew
13:08  _rane: thank you
13:08  thelogicdump: Ok, do you use it with c or c++ ? And if c++ do you use anythign that provides you with a go to definition/find all references kind of functionality
13:09  evilgeenius: test
13:09  rson: pass
13:11  heeen: thelogicdump: no I didn't have time to try it out in depth yet
13:11  heeen: I don't think it has that functionality
13:12  thelogicdump: Thanks
13:12  kurrata: hi, is there some plugin for vim which can tell what classes/variables/functions/ i have in my opened file?

23:10  ReinH: Does anyone here work on the ruby completion in ruby.vim? I'm getting errors for the omnicomplete function
23:11  ReinH: Specifically, I get an error when in contexts 1 and 2 (per :h ft-ruby-omni) and it doesn't complete symbol names in context 4
23:12  sheepz: hello, is it possible to vsplit an open tab?
23:13  spiiph: Uh, sure?
23:13  ReinH: sheepz: what are you expecting that :vsplit doesn't do?
23:14  sheepz: how do I reference another open tab?
23:14  sheepz: that I have opened with :tabe
23:14  jamessan: you switch to it and run :vsplit
23:14  ReinH: I think we are missunderstanding you, or vice versa
23:15  ReinH: what exactly are you trying to do?
23:15  sheepz: well, I have a lot of files opened within a session, I want to view two tabs at the same time with vsplit
23:16  gkatsev: how can I tell if an option such as 'rnu' is available?
23:16  gkatsev: well, other than looking for vim version

23:17  jamessan: sheepz: no, you want to view two buffers at the same time
23:17  ReinH: sheepz: you can't view two tabs at the same time with vsplit. You can view two buffers at the same time.
23:17  ReinH: jamessan: you win
23:17  jamessan: gkatsev: :help exists()
23:17  jamessan: vimgor: buffers
23:17  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
23:18  jamessan: sheepz: ^^
23:18  sheepz: ok, thanks
23:18  gkatsev: jamessan: ooh, thanks. forgot about exists. was looking at has.
23:19  ReinH: nice
23:19  ReinH: Can I tell vim to always "Load All" when it detects changes to files in open buffers?
23:19  ReinH: a :help page would be sufficient :)

23:28  fow: Alternatively, you can spend the time to learn Vim like Vim (though if I were in your position I would just use Emacs)
23:28  andrewszhao: fow, but the fact is I have get used to vim....
23:28  fow: why? :o
23:29  andrewszhao: will key mapping help?
23:29  ReinH: why do you have to get used to vim?
23:29  ReinH: and why do you want it to behave like emacs? It works much better like vim
23:29  andrewszhao: emacs sucks, I have to use my feet to operate
23:29 --- Channel #vim was synced in 84 seconds
23:29  ReinH: no, emacs does not suck
23:30  ReinH: you aren't being very constructive here
23:30  fow: er, you have to use your feet?
23:30  andrewszhao: ReiH, the command is so complicated that I can not do it well
23:30  elasticdog: is there a way to have 'match' only effect the current buffer?
23:30  ReinH: andrewszhao: have you run vimtutor?
23:30  andrewszhao: I like the C-f in emacs
23:31  andrewszhao: I have read lots of times of tutor and the online doc
23:32  ReinH: have you actually done the exercises in the tutor?
23:32  ReinH: if you're complaining that you can't move around in vim efficiently, I have doubts
23:32  andrewszhao: but I still know nothing about the key-mapping stuff, especially the problem I had raised just now
23:32  ReinH: on the other hand, if you just want to complain that vim is not emacs, I'm not sure I can help you
23:32  ReinH: the solution to your problem is to move around in normal mode, not insert mode.
23:32  ReinH: if that's not what you want to do, you don't want vim
23:33  ReinH: it's pretty much as simple as that
23:33  andrewszhao: nope, that is not the problem, a better solution given by the online doc says that you can press c-u and then any command in command mode
23:33  ReinH: ?
23:34  andrewszhao: nope,...sorry, I can not remember the key -binding
23:34  estragib: you mean c-o
23:34  ReinH: yes
23:35  andrewszhao: I just want to figure out a better way to move around in vim in either mode
23:35  ReinH: andrewszhao: and you have been given the answer multiple times
23:35  andrewszhao: ReinH, yes, exactly
23:35  ReinH: normal mode has excellent navigation commands
23:35  ReinH: so use them
23:35  andrewszhao: but I'm not satisfied with any of them
23:35  ReinH: then vim is not for you
23:35  engla: maybe it comes with time
23:35  engla: seriously, it takes time to learn Vim
23:36  ReinH: engla: not because he doesn't know the navigation commands, but because he's rather complain in here than go learn them
23:36  ReinH: *he'd
23:36  ReinH: vim is not for you, and neither is #vim
23:37  andrewszhao: ReinH, no......if it is the feeling I gave you, I feel pretty much sorry,....but I do not mean to
23:37  estragib: andrewszhao: really, come clean with what you want. you don't like emacs' key chording, but don't want the logical alternative. c-o is mildly useful if you only want to do one action. otherwise it's much more economical to just hit that *one* key and go about navigating vim-style
23:37  andrewszhao: I just want to know whether u guys know a better idea
23:38  ReinH: andrewszhao: a better idea than WHAT?
23:38  andrewszhao: to move around
23:38  ReinH: yes
23:38  ReinH: as we have said
23:38  engla: andrewszhao: how much have you used Vim? maybe just use it more and try what works best for you.
23:38  ReinH: vim's normal mode movement commands
23:38  ReinH: if you don't think they're sufficient, you don't know them well enough
23:38  andrewszhao: blame to say.... 1 and a half
23:39  ReinH: I think the only real answer is "learn more about vim"
23:40  ReinH: it will take a while to learn ALL of vim's movement commands, if it's even possible, but you can learn a large enough subset to move around very efficiently
23:40  andrewszhao: so, let it go... perhaps I have to press F , and search backforwd to find the exact place I want to correct
23:40  ReinH: andrewszhao: if you ask us questions like "how can I do x", where x is something like "delete all the text inside a pair of quotes", we can give you answers
23:40  ReinH: if you ask questions like "how can I move better?" the only answer we can give you is "learn more vim"
23:41  ReinH: the tutorial covers basic movement
23:41 --- andrewszhao is now known as andrews
23:41  ReinH: :help movement will cover more
23:41  ReinH: sry, help motion.txt
23:42  andrews: ReinH, thanks,
23:42  andrews: I'll read it in detail
23:42  ReinH: if motion.txt doesn't provide you with enough tools to move fluently in vim, it may just not be a good choice
23:58  ReinH: hmm, is there a mapping for :ptag that works like CTRL-] ?
23:58  ReinH: i.e. opens the ident under the curser in a preview window?
23:58  ReinH: cursor
