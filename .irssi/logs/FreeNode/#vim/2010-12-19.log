02:05  yurifury: Hi Guys, is there any variable interpolation in vim? I'm trying to write a script which includes a line like 'hi Something guifg=color1', and trying to avoid exe
02:06  homekevin: yurifury: Avoiding exec is futile.
02:06  Raimondi: yurifury: No
02:06  homekevin: But printf makes it a bit nicer.
02:06  yurifury: fair nuff, thanks
02:06  yurifury: i've just been using echo, and then replacing with exe once it looks right
02:07  homekevin: exec > exe
02:07  yurifury: …seems a bit silly, is all
02:07  homekevin: yurifury: So you're new to Vim scripting I see. :P
02:08  yurifury: mmmm, trying to extend and make efficient a script I wrote last year
02:08  homekevin: It starts at silly and goes on from there.
02:09  yurifury: I raged when I figured out why "matchadd(var1, var2)" wasn't working
02:09  yurifury: I was using it in a void context and vim was complaining
02:09  yurifury: Now that's silly.
02:10  homekevin: Oh, you mean not as a command? No :call?
02:10  yurifury: yeah
02:10  homekevin: I usually forget :let
02:10  yurifury: I was resorting to wrapping it in exec just to make it not complain, and then figured out I needed a "let something = matchadd…"
02:10  yurifury: yeah
02:10  yurifury: augh.
02:17  ampzamp: vim only (not gvim): regular note taking results in all hite text based on my colors. code of course is great and colorful. So, i thought i'd have to use plugin Txtfmt as a way to make my notes and stuff more readable with colors. Now I'm thinking that 'Txtfmt' may only be for Gvim. Any was to add anything to each line I want colored so that my todo lists jump out at me more?
02:17  ampzamp: *white

15:34  Dynetrekk: with tags: is it possible to go the "other way" wrt. ctrl-] ?
15:35  Dynetrekk: i.e. list where a function is called, not where it is defined?
15:42  spiiph: With cscope
15:46  robgleeson: /buffer 1
15:46  robgleeson: oops
15:46  FernandoBasso: robgleeson: vim irssi keybindings, I guess.
15:47  robgleeson: na, leading space.
15:47  robgleeson: i use weechat
15:47  robgleeson: i would love vim keybinds tho :>
15:47  FernandoBasso: Oh. Weechat uses /buffers to go to another windows? Cool!
15:48  FernandoBasso:  /window 1
15:48  FernandoBasso: Hmm. I purposely add a leading space, and it shows up. Yours didn't.
15:49  Miesco: If I got three columns of text seperated by tabs, how do I match the third columns?
15:50  FernandoBasso: Miesco: Isn't visual block an option?
15:50  Miesco: Also how do I get a list of Ex commands?
15:51  mhi^: Dynetrekk: I also like using [I when the cursor is on a function or variable name.

16:03  Miesco: FernandoBasso: Go with urxvt :)
16:03  Dynetrekk: Miesco:  I installed it, but I don't see what's so nice with urxvt?
16:03  Miesco: Its nice and fast
16:03  FernandoBasso: *And*, a lot of vim hacker say the hell about urxvt. That it is a broken terminal. In my case, xterm, urxvt and gnome-terminal have never given me problems. Nothing that can't be configured or tweaked in some way.
16:03  Miesco: and it supports unicode
16:03  FernandoBasso: Dynetrekk: urxvt has to be configured.
16:03  Dynetrekk: Miesco: it doesn't show colors in ls, for one.
16:03  Miesco: Dynetrekk: What?
16:03  FernandoBasso: It has tons of features.
16:03  Dynetrekk: configured, to do anything at all?
16:03  Dynetrekk: yep, Miesco
16:03  Miesco: ls --colors
16:03  Dynetrekk: Miesco: ls -G on the mac, but yes
16:03  FernandoBasso: "15 Years of Vi + 7 years of Vim and still learning 12Oct10 : Last Update"
16:04  FernandoBasso: Miesco: Nice page.
16:04  Miesco: I dunno, i've used it before and had no problem.  rxvt I think is scriptable
16:04 --- Channel #vim was synced in 203 seconds
16:05  Dynetrekk: maybe you can configure it to show colors :P
16:05  Miesco: It should
16:06  Miesco: I am using uxterm right now
16:07  FernandoBasso: These three lines make urxvt open links for me: http://vim.pastey.net/144061
16:11  sid3k: hi all. is there any popular guide about changing default config directory of vim?
16:12 --- chronos__ is now known as chronos
16:12  sid3k: I want to put my vim configuration under ~/.config directory
16:13  chronos: there is a way of change directory that vim read conf (.vimrc) and files like plugins, colorschemes, etc ?
16:13  mhi^: sid3k: cd ~; mv .vimrc .config/vim/vimrc; ln -s .config/vim/vimrc .vimrc
16:15  mhi^: chronos: same for you; move it to where you want and just symlink it
16:15  chronos: mhi^: I'm at windows 7...
16:16  sid3k: mhi^: what about color scheme and other files?
16:16  chronos: ( i missed this detail hehe )
16:16  FernandoBasso: I think you can change the runtimepath in vimrc.
16:16  mhi^: you'd have to do that globally then, of course
16:17  sid3k: I already changed it but color schemes and snippets don't work now
16:17  mhi^: sid3k: how did you change it?
16:17  FernandoBasso:  in vimrc: :set runtimepath=~/.config/vim/
16:17  Miesco: How do I get a list of maps to Function keys?
16:17  chronos: hmm, and in shortcut I force to use specific vimrc
16:17  sid3k: FernandoBasso: is it a legal syntax for config file?
16:17  FernandoBasso: sid3k: :help runtimepath
16:18  FernandoBasso: I don't recall perfectly, I think. Help is the best mentor. :)
16:18  sid3k: mhi^: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3377298/how-can-i-override-vim-and-vimrc-paths-but-no-others-in-vim/3384476#3384476
16:18  sid3k: followed the first answer
16:19  mhi^: Then you'd have to built an alias for vim and top/ps output will look ugly. Really, I'd just go for symlinks.
16:19  mhi^: *you'll have to build
16:20  sid3k: haha, I got the answer: have to built an alias for vim and top/ps output will look
16:20  sid3k:        ugly. Really, I'd just go for symlinks.                          [15:22]
16:20  sid3k: <mhi^> *you'll have to build
16:20  sid3k: sorry for wrong paste guys, ssh accident
16:21  sid3k: mhi^: thanks anyway, I'm creating sym link
16:21  mhi^: *victory*
16:22  sid3k: haha
16:23  Miesco: In help if i go to like :map_l, how do I go to that section if my cursor is on it?
16:23  Miesco: I thought it was shift+[
16:23  FernandoBasso:  It is ^]
16:23  FernandoBasso: Where ^ is ctrl.
16:24  bosie: anyone has a tip as to how to use folding?
16:24  bosie: i really have a problem using it. i don't seem to see the visual cues
16:24  FernandoBasso: Miesco: What editor/IDE are you coming from? Or you use vim for a long time?
16:25  mhi^: bosie: cues == the text of an folded fold? :>
16:26  bosie: mhi^: no. markings as to where folds are
16:27  Miesco: FernandoBasso: I used vim for 10 years
16:27  FernandoBasso: Wow!
16:27  Miesco: and Im 23! lol
16:28  FernandoBasso: Is that page yours?
16:28  Miesco: no lol
16:28  mhi^: bosie: You mean folds don't get highlighted as those? (If I still get it wrong, please provide a screenshot)
16:28  Miesco: I'm not that efficient
16:28  bosie: mhi^: exactly
16:28  bosie: mhi^: when the fold is open, i have no clue as to whether or not there is a fold
16:28  mhi^: bosie: but it works with other colorschemes?
16:28  FernandoBasso: How come you forget (or did not learn) about jumps like ^] in  the help?
16:29  mhi^: bosie: well, how do you create the fold?
16:29  Miesco: I haven't put my .vimrc on subversion yet so i'm not THAT efficient :P
16:29  FernandoBasso: In ten years!
16:29  FernandoBasso: haha
16:29  bosie: mhi^: i don't create them manually. they are created automatically
16:29  bosie: mhi^: via the latex plugin i suppose
16:30  bosie: mhi^: and they are there. i just can't seem them
16:30  mhi^: bosie: so 'fdm' is probably set to syntax. syntax folding differs from.. syntax to syntax. There's no way to see where a fold starts.
16:30  bosie: mhi^: why not?
16:31  bosie: mhi^: what has that to do with the actual fold?
16:31  bosie: mhi^: fdm is set to manual
16:32 --- fr0gprince__ is now known as fr0gprince
16:32  mhi^: bosie: :set foldmaker?
16:32  mhi^: *foldmarker
16:32  FernandoBasso: How useful to map <C-S-l> to <C-W>l and so on.
16:32  bosie: {{{,}}}
16:33  mhi^: bosie: do you have those {{{ at the beginning of a fold?
16:33  mhi^: most probably in a commen
16:33  bosie: mhi^: it folds on \section{}
16:33  bosie: mhi^: and \subsection{foo}
16:34  bosie: mhi^: but i still don't get how this is relevant to visual cues? does vim provide it or not?
16:36  mhi^: If 'cues' means what I think, then there's none.
16:36  bosie: mhi^: how do i know where a fold is?
16:38  mhi^: Well, it depends on the foldmethod ('fdm'). To be honest I was wondering why it's auto-folding for you, although the fdm is set to 'manual'. But then again I almost only use 'marker'. Guess I'm no help here.
16:38  FernandoBasso: http://pastebin.com/SEMSB0Rf
16:38  bosie: mhi^: alright
16:39  bosie: FernandoBasso: i have no text with }}}
16:40  FernandoBasso: That is just an example, as long as you change the foldmethod at the end...
16:40  bosie: FernandoBasso: k
16:42  fholgado: morning guys, is there any way that I can change the status line format based on the current buffer name?
16:44  fholgado: something like this code
16:44  fholgado: http://vim.pastey.net/144062
16:44  fholgado: except I am unsure if I would have to write a function and call it when buffers are loaded or at some other event?
16:47  peter_w: if you want to automatically run that command you probably want to use an autocommand
16:48  mhi^: :au BufReadPost * if bufname('%') == "foo" | set stl=... | endif
16:48  mhi^: (untested)
16:48  fholgado: ah... cool
16:49  fholgado: now it looks like the status line's format it global, so I think what I want to do wont work anyways
16:49  peter_w: it isn't
16:49  fholgado: I wanted to have different information on the status bar for my minibufexpl buffer, but still keep normal formatting on the other buffers
16:50  fholgado: when I change it it's affecting all open buffers
16:50  peter_w: :he global-local
16:50  fholgado: :)
16:50  mhi^: What he said. And check ":h autocmd-events"; especially the buffers section. There might be a better fitting event for your case.
16:51  fholgado: yes sir, I am thinking that when the buffer gets created is probably the best time
17:04  fholgado: well, I ended up just solving it by making the plugin set the local status line when it creates the buffer
17:04  fholgado: works well enough, I didn't know about being able to set it locally
17:04  fholgado: thanks all!
17:10  jvv: hi, how can i tell my vim to update gnome-terminal title when i open a file ? i want to have filename in the tab...
17:11  fholgado: hm, so you're talking about changing the content of the tab of the term where you're running vim?
17:12  jvv: fholgado: yes, so it would show name of the file that i am editing
17:13  fholgado: jvv: Not sure how you would do that, do you have any idea what the tab's content is pulled from?
17:16  xlq_: How can I find out where an option was set from?
17:16  jvv: fholgado: i dont know how ;] thats why i am asking... normally echo -e '\033]2;NameIwantToPut\007' does the trick
17:16  mhi^: jvv: It should show the X window title. And per default that one should change automatically.
17:16  mhi^: xlq_: :verb set option?
17:17  xlq_: mhi^: Thanks :)
17:17  fholgado: jvv: :) What problem are you trying to solve? are you using multiple vims open on multiple term tabs?
17:18  jvv: fholgado: i have gnome-terminal... in a gnome-terminal tab that has title 'Terminal'... i open a file with vim and would like the title to change to filename of the file i am opening
17:20  peter_w: jvv: how do you usually set the title of the tab when not using vim?
17:21  jvv: peter_w: echo -e '\033]2;NameIwantToPut\007'
17:21  FernandoBasso: jvv: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/093
17:22  mhi^: FernandoBasso: that's what he said before, just the pretty version.
17:22  peter_w: jvv: ok, did you try setting t_ts to that escape sequence?
17:23  jvv: peter_w: i use ksh... dont know if it will work... but can try
17:23  peter_w: jvv: in vim
17:23  FernandoBasso: Well, gnome-terminal let's us set the title. Here, Ctrl-t pops up a window so that I can set the title, although I seldom use it.
17:24  xlq_: *lets
17:24  FernandoBasso: xlq_: Coorect.
17:24  FernandoBasso: :/
17:25  FernandoBasso: I am forgetting the spelling more and more.
17:25  xlq_: No proobelm.
17:29  fholgado: is there any way to set colors locally per buffer? I tried setlocal hi statusline but it gives me an error
17:30  FernandoBasso: I saw a plugin for that.
17:30  fholgado: I was hoping not to have to depend on an external plugin... :/
17:31  fholgado: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=351 is it I beliebe...
17:31  fholgado: *believe...
17:33  FernandoBasso: No. This one is old. Probably unmaintained.
17:34  fholgado: Can't find anything else...
17:35  robgleeson: strange request, but - is it possible to tell vim to redraw its windows? I'll explain my problem. my plugin executes `links`, which executes fine, but when it exists vim is a black void and can only be fixed via :colorscheme <scheme>
17:35  robgleeson: exits to vim**
17:36  xlq_: robgleeson: C-l
17:36  fholgado: robgleeson: and help:redraw
17:36  robgleeson: ty :)
17:37  fholgado: robgleeson: you might be able to add that function to the plugin so that you don't have to do it manually
17:37  FernandoBasso: fholgado: Perhaps I was mistaken. I think I had read about a plugin to alow colors for each buffer in my feeds...
17:38  fholgado: FernandoBasso: No worries, it's not that big of a deal that I'd hack another plugin into this one
17:39  robgleeson: fholgado: yup, going to do that.
17:49  ws: is there a lightweight vim+perl integration plugin (quickfix, a decent autocompletion)?  I tried perl-support.vim, but was immiediately turned off by templates with comments for files
17:50  mhi^: ws: :set makeprg + :make + snipmate + tags
17:50  mhi^: *:compiler
17:53  ws: mhi:  thanks :-)

18:21  craiggles: hey guys im just starting to use vim and i like it, i'm using auto indent and c indent for js i was wondering how i would go about having my html and css auto indented, for css after the {, and for html after <element>\n
18:22  FernandoBasso: vimgor: cindent
18:22  vimgor: No idea!
18:23  FernandoBasso: :/
18:24  chronos: gg=G
18:24  chronos: vimgor: it in command mode
18:24  vimgor: Wish I knew.
18:24  chronos: ops, craiggles ^^
18:25  FernandoBasso: craiggles: I also have to hit <Tab> every time I do a { in css.
18:25  FernandoBasso: I still have to find a solution for this myself.
18:25  craiggles: well, yeah same, i have tab converted into two-spaces.
18:26  craiggles: chronos: so i can just add gg=G to my .vimrc?
18:26  FernandoBasso: Hmm. I have autoclose.vim. With it disabled I just get the corret indentation.
18:26  FernandoBasso: craiggles: gg=G is to 'reformat' (indent) an non-indented file.
18:26  craiggles: oh.
18:26  FernandoBasso: Like when we get one from the web, or something like that.
18:26  craiggles: well that's not what i'm wanting.
18:27  craiggles: i want it to be indenting while im coding.
18:27  chronos: craiggles: it reindent all file
18:27  chronos: if it works, identation in html should be working too
18:28  FernandoBasso: craiggles: Do you have "filetype plugin indent on" in vimrc?
18:28  craiggles: so when i'm in command mode, ie pressing esc, i type `gg=G` or `:gg=G`? .. just because the former doesn't work and the latter complains about no such command.
18:28  chronos: eh, that's is important.....
18:28  craiggles: FernandoBasso: no.
18:28  FernandoBasso: I also recommend set encoding=utf-8 and set fileencoding=utf-8
18:29  FernandoBasso: craiggles: That is the first step.
18:29  chronos: craiggles: take a look on my custom vimrc, https://github.com/chronossc/my-vim-confs
18:29  FernandoBasso: craiggles: It is just gg=g without the :
18:29  FernandoBasso: gg=G <--
18:29  craiggles: ill have a look, mine will be a tad different since im using dvorak.
18:29  chronos: about indentation, set up what FernandoBasso said in your .vimrc
18:30  craiggles: for some reason i cant right click in the terminal now...weird.
18:30  FernandoBasso: chronos: Are you not Brazilian?
18:30  FernandoBasso: I remember this nick name form #archlinux-br or #gentoo-br i think.
18:30  chronos: I'm FernandoBasso

18:36  craiggles: i'm actually really enjoying vim, i've got a cheat sheet on my desk..should be good when i become productive with it :)
18:36  chronos: it is stable, well featured, with powerfull toys to develop and vimscript is amazing to customize stuff, without talk in strong community and that run in a lot of systems
18:36  FernandoBasso: craiggles: :help from usr_01.txt to usr_10.txt is about 95% of we use everyday.

18:37  chronos: and vim with a nice font (I'm using consolas on linux and windows) and a nice theme (I use wombat modified, it's one dark theme)
18:38  chronos: with that we don't have another good editor to fight against
18:38  FernandoBasso: Aye.

18:44  FernandoBasso: fholgado: We are becoming emacs-styled some how. haha
18:44  FernandoBasso: Vim is becoming an OS too.
18:44  fholgado: FernandoBasso: I think it's just to get them to finally shut up... :P
18:44  FernandoBasso: ahha
19:10  s1n: i'm trying to get supertab to work in the console version, doesn't seem to take over for either tab or c-tab, what would i be doing wrong?
19:12  s1n: completion works with c-n/c-p but not for tab
19:29  ceej: is there a way to load a settings file after absolutely everything else?
19:30  fow: ceej, depending on what exactly you're doing, perhaps place it in an after/ directory or source it with a VimEnter autocommand. Why does it need to be absolutely after everything else?
19:31  ceej: because I want to set cmdheight=3 and somehow it gets set to 2
19:31  ceej: i tried in after/autoload but no go...
19:32  fow: Why not see what's setting cmdheight with :verbose set cmdheight?
19:32  fow: (with the question mark)
19:32  tantari: Hi People, What is the best way to have correctly idented javascript files ?
19:33  fow: tantari, filetype plugin indent on -- if the indent file that ships with Vim isn't satisfactory for you, maybe someone else felt the same way and made one and posted it somewhere
19:33  ws: while we are at javascript -- I found this nugget today:  http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/
19:33  ceej: fow: ah ty I forgot about that gvimrc was setting ch to 2 :)
19:34  ampzamp: Plugin Txtfmt: nothing happens when I type '\i' in normal mode other than taking me into insert mode. Something really dumb my end. I am expecting to see: Enter a fmt / clr string. (Enter to cancel):
19:34  fow: ceej, yw
19:34  s1n: i figured it out, :set paste was always inserting literal tabs
19:34  fow: ampzamp, is \ your leader? :echo mapleader
19:35  ampzamp: first attempt: (lacking much skill obviously) GETS: E121: Undefined variable: mapleader
19:36  ampzamp: and also:E15: Invalid expression: mapleader
19:36  fow: that means \ is your leader
19:37  fow: Is that key sequence mapped? :map \i
19:37  tantari: fow: The builting js mode sucks
19:38  ampzamp: hope this is right: at the bottom i get: s  \           * b<BS>\
19:38  fow: ampzamp, that's the only output?
19:40  ampzamp: right -- Txtfmt works I believe. I get the helppage all nice etc.
19:41  ampzamp: Don't really know what's next on this. perhaps I've done something really obviously wrong. I start vim, I do :set ft-txtfmt  THEN without leaving normal mode I type \i   which result in me going into inster mode.
19:41  fow: I've not used the plugin, so I don't really know anything about it, but \i doesn't seem to be mapped
19:43  ampzamp: So \ IS my leader. And \i is not mapped to anything. I've typed :map \i in normal mode. what other than the output right there at the bottom should I see/do? THANKS!
19:44  fow: At the bottom you should see something like      n  \i        * some_stuff_here_that_will_vary
19:46  ampzamp: hmmm... so I will check the google groups or other for why I get: s  \           * b<BS>\
19:51  fow: oh, that one's caused by snipmate
19:52  fow: you should have a second one for Txtfmt
20:04  ampzamp: very helpful: indeed i have snipmate in there! Soooo... what to do?
20:05  ampzamp: remove snipmate until my skill level goes up?
20:05  ampzamp: then I'd get the txtfmt default again?
20:07  Dynetrekk: ampzamp: no reason to remove it. snipmate is infinitely easy to use
20:08  ampzamp: with snipmate removed (testing) I now get No Mapping Found for :map \i
20:10  Dynetrekk: ah, there's some key mapping crash?
20:15  ampzamp: just did   :map and a HUGE list of txtfmt related stuff comes up. have to figure out how to scroll with urxvt in tumx to see all. though starting up in simle term gets me a different shot list. it seems anyways.
20:16  ampzamp: *simple *short
20:20  heoa: in browsing args-list, what is the previous key, n=next but what is to go backward?
20:21  ampzamp: mistaken on simple term as my term always opens in a tumx instance. Anyways, VERY weird. invoking one of my terms get JUST the mapping OTHER than txtfmt yet in my SAME urxvt term (still in tumx instance) started via Xmonad ScratchpadKey I get a full monster list including txtfmt bunch.
20:22  ampzamp: that's not clear at all, sorry. Though looks for certain I've not got any mapping for \i  so that's all really helpful. much appreciated.
20:53  ampzamp: SOLVED: installed the vimball though don't think that was it. Simply needed to type    ,i   imstead of   \i     THANKS for the motivation. Struggles rule!!!
21:00  heoa: are the `:rewind` and `:next` the only keys to move in args-list of ex/vi?
21:01  heoa: and the keys last-first-etc seem to be the additions, have research more
21:01  heoa: additions to vim

21:21  taylanub: is there an iskeyword alike setting that will only affect syntax matching (and not e.g. 'w') ?
21:22  Silex: ooooh, cursor in insert mode always moves before what you tell it, and in normal mode it's after
21:22  Silex: so I guess I have to go out of insert mode first
21:27  heoa: a,b!xclip -i     <---- why does it not copy the are btw lines to xclipboard?
21:27  heoa: errr area
21:29  heoa: perhaps i need here some command, not w apparently,   :a,bw !xclip -i,  what is the command needed there:   :a,b<COMMAND?> !xclip -i  ?
21:29 --- Silex is now known as silex
21:32  craiggles: Hey, so on my cheat sheet it says that if i want to insert line above then i have to `O`, but this then takes me into insert mode, is there a way i can insert new lines above w/o going into insert mode? below as well.
21:32  Miesco: heoa: a,b<command>w !xclip
21:32  Miesco: I think
21:32  Miesco: yea
21:35  danielsh: craiggles: there are several ways, see :help :r and :help p for example
21:36  taylanub: craiggles: no default keybind does [exactly] that. you can always add your own. i have:  nnoremap <silent> <Return> o<Esc>u:silent redo<CR>
21:36  Miesco: How do I list all the mapped function keys?
21:37  craiggles: taylanub, danielsh. i see, thanks.
21:37  Miesco: I tried :map <F
21:37  Miesco: but its a special key
21:37  fow: taylanub, why do you undo and then redo it?
21:38  taylanub: fow: so the cursor stays in place ... maybe there's a better way
21:38  fow: ah
21:38  danielsh: Miesco: drop the last two characters?
21:38  Miesco: danielsh: I want _just_ the function keys
21:39  heoa: Miesco: what is the <command>?
21:39  Miesco: heoa: Thats what i'm asking you
21:39  danielsh: Miesco: use :redir then?  or just loop from 1 to 10 or 12 ...
21:39  taylanub: this --More-- mode vim uses is quite stupid in my very personal opinion
21:39  danielsh: like I have a mapping that does     ':hi SpellBad | :hi SpellLocal'
21:40  danielsh: taylanub: :help append()
21:41  heoa: Miesco: i don't know, need to read the next manual or think it through
21:41  Miesco: heoa: Are you talking about the xclipboard question?
21:42  FernandoBasso: I am back. I couldn't stand being away from you guys.
21:42  heoa: Miesco: I try to write text from vim to xclipboard
21:43  Miesco: heoa: :a,b<command>w !xclip
21:43  peter_w: heoa: you don't have "*?
21:43  Miesco: "*?
21:44  starlays: hi to all
21:44  heoa: peter_w: sorry confusion a and b are not bufferst but line numbers
21:44  FernandoBasso: starlays: Welcome.
21:44  peter_w: heoa: :he "*
21:44  Miesco: heoa: :a,bw !xclip
21:44  taylanub: danielsh: thanks, though it puts the cursor to the beginning of the file...
21:45  starlays: i need some help with a plugin... i`ve installed surround and tried cs"' and i get an error that is telling me that there is no such command cs... what might be the problem?
21:46  FernandoBasso: starlays: How did you install it?
21:46  starlays: FernandoBasso: Extract to ~/.vim, or ~\vimfiles (Windows).  You'll need to regenerate helptags (fill in the install path below)
21:46  danielsh: taylanub: for me it doesn't move the cursor
21:46  starlays: FernandoBasso: exactly as it says in the documentation ...
21:47  FernandoBasso: starlays: :scriptnames <-- and look for surround.vim
21:47  starlays: FernandoBasso: yes it is there ...
21:48  Miesco: peter_w: "* is awesome!  Didn't know about that
21:49  Miesco: peter_w: I got a binding that puts the selection to a pastebin and puts the url in the inputline of irssi :)
21:49  FernandoBasso: starlays: did you generate the helptags?
21:49  starlays: FernandoBasso: yes
21:49  FernandoBasso: Perhaps there is some specific config for windows?
21:49  starlays: FernandoBasso: where?
21:50  FernandoBasso: starlays: What does it return if you type :nnoremap cs<Enter>
21:50  FernandoBasso: ?
21:52  starlays: FernandoBasso: it is saying that :n cs <plug>Csurround
21:52  FernandoBasso: starlays: Like here.
21:52  starlays: FernandoBasso: why it is not working?
21:53  FernandoBasso: I am thinking.
21:54  starlays: FernandoBasso:  found the problem... i`m not suppose to use : :P jus cs :))
21:54  FernandoBasso: starlays: What about ds" or ds'? Do they do something?
21:54  FernandoBasso: Oh.
21:54  starlays: :D
21:55  FernandoBasso: Yeah. It is a normal mode command. Not Command-line mode.
21:56  heoa: Miesco: peter_w thank you, got yanked to xclipboard after pressing mouse middle button but not immediately after "a,bw !xclip" that I was looking for
21:58  peter_w: heoa: huh?
22:00  taylanub: is there an iskeyword alike setting that will only affect syntax matching (and not e.g. 'w') ?
22:02  Miesco: heoa: Yea it does work
22:02  heoa: peter_w: sorry not yet fully grapped the manual about "*
22:02  Miesco: heoa: Try doing shitft+insert to paste it
22:03  heoa: Miesco: yeah it does but the thing a,b occurs on my xclipboard after pressing middle-key-button, I feel odd
22:03  Miesco: heoa: :w !xclip
22:03  Miesco: try that
22:04  Miesco: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307146/
22:04  Miesco: Yes!
22:05  Miesco: Use that script with the screen session named 'main', then do: :w !wgetpaste | script_name
22:05  taylanub: Miesco: lrn2bash :P
22:06  Miesco: taylanub: huh?
22:06  taylanub: use [[ not [
22:06  taylanub: sorry i can't stand bad shell code
22:06  Miesco: Whats wrong with [ anyways
22:07  taylanub: it's the standard one; synonym to 'test'. it doesn't even support == originally (but '=')
22:07  taylanub: when you already rely on bash-specific features, [[ is better in all ways
22:07  Miesco: [ is sh compatible?
22:08  taylanub: yes.  ---  in [[ you don't need to double-quote.  also you should double quote the $input in echo $input
22:09  Miesco: Shouldn't be echoing
22:10  taylanub: using a function instead of variable&eval, and "$@" instead of $* would also be good, generally
22:10  Miesco: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/307149/
22:12  Miesco: Its an extremely good script
22:12  Miesco: Except now my screen(1) is messed up
22:15  Miesco: Like I just hit F2 and a link to my file on a pastebin is on the inputline of irssi
22:17  Miesco: does :redir redirect just for the command?
22:21  Miesco: :map | redir > !less
22:21  taylanub: i hate you freenode
22:21  Miesco: I'm trying to do this
22:24  FernandoBasso: Thank you tomaw_.
22:25  Miesco: :for $i in range(1,3); :echo $i; :endfor
22:25  Miesco: Not working
22:26  spiiph: No, of course not.
22:26  Miesco: I took out the $s
22:26  Raimondi: s/;/|
22:28  Miesco: :for i in range(1,12)| :map "<F".i.">"| :endfor
22:28  Miesco: not working
22:28  FernandoBasso: Can we :man an :nmap <C-0> (zero) ?
22:28  Raimondi: Miesco:  :exec 'map <F'.i.'>'
22:29  spiiph: Miesco, why don't you learn vimscript syntax instead of telling us about everything that's not working?
22:30  homekevin: Is someone complaining about function keys not working again?
22:30  homekevin: Because I have a script for that.
22:31  Miesco: :for i in range(1,12)| :exec 'map <F'.i.'>'| :endfor
22:31  Miesco: tHAT WORKS
22:31  homekevin: Caps lock
22:31  Miesco: homekevin: No just trying to see the bindings
22:31  homekevin: Oh.
22:32  Miesco: I bet there's an easier way
22:33  homekevin: printf
22:33  homekevin: You also need map! to see some bindings.
22:34  homekevin: And you don't need :
22:34  homekevin: at least not after |
22:34  homekevin: But if there were Easy Ways to do everything, it wouldn't be Vim.
22:37  Miesco: I got three columns seperated by two tabs, how do I match the third columns?
22:37  Miesco: wait nvm
22:40  malesca: I've mostly fallen in love with Vim, but the weird regexp dialect is a huge turnoff. I know I can fix the weird half-escaping with \v, but there are other annoyances. < and > instead of \b for word boundaries, \w in [\w-] means the two characters \ and w instead of "any word character" etc. Any way to fix that?
22:41  fogobogo: hi. anyone knows what these lines at the very left are called? and/or how to get those? http://blogs.gnome.org/lharris/files/2008/07/vim-gtk-complete.png
22:41  fogobogo: those function markers(?) there
22:41  Raimondi: :h 'nu  and :h 'fdc
22:41  homekevin: malesca: You cannot change Vim's regexes short of modify
22:41  Raimondi: fogobogo: ^
22:41  homekevin: ...modifying the source
22:42  fogobogo: alright thanks
22:42  Miesco: malesca: I was gunna ask the same thing
22:43  malesca: homekevin: Thanks. Suppose you get used to the differences eventually. For something like [\w-], I suppose the best Vim equivalent is (\w|-) then?
22:43  Miesco: and having to do \( to capture :/
22:43  malesca: Miesco: That one you can get rid of by prefixing the whole regexp with \v I believe
22:44  homekevin: Always use \v
22:44  malesca: Miesco: :help magic
22:44  Miesco: always?
22:45  homekevin: Always.
22:45  homekevin: Unless you are using \V
22:45  homekevin: Or searching for something with no special chars at all.
22:45  homekevin: But other than that, always.
22:46  homekevin: Especially in scripts, where 'magic' may or may not be set.
22:46  homekevin: In which case I *guess* you can also use \m if you really want to.
22:46  homekevin: Or \M
22:46  homekevin: But I don't know why you'd do that when you can just use \v.
22:47  homekevin: Anyway, other than those 5 or 6 cases, always use \v.
22:48  Miesco: wow \v is awesome!
22:48  Miesco: Its so much easier and clearer
22:49  homekevin: Oh, you shouldn't use \v. Not ever.
22:49  FernandoBasso: Is it possible to remove that 'Press ? for help' in NERDTree?
22:49  Miesco: How do you search with an Ex command?
22:49  Miesco: FernandoBasso: Yes
22:49  FernandoBasso: Miesco: How so?
22:49  Miesco: I dunno, just know its possible
22:49  homekevin: Miesco: :global maybe?
22:50  FernandoBasso: I am reading the help.
22:50  Miesco: FernandoBasso: You can always just change the script
22:50  Miesco: I want the search to be highlighted as im doing it
22:51  Miesco: Like I can do: /\v(.*\t\t), then it highlights while im doing it, then when I know its good, I change it to a :s/
22:52  homekevin: Miesco: You can use :s// to use the previous / search
22:52  Miesco: homekevin: really?
22:53  homekevin: Really.
22:53  Miesco: how? :)
22:54  ws: Miesco: literally
22:55  homekevin: Well, you should add a replacement section, but yeah.
22:56  homekevin: Maybe even some flags if you're into that sort of thing.
22:56  homekevin: (I know I am)
22:56  homekevin: You could go really crazy and prepend a range.
22:56  homekevin: But don't do that under the influence of anything that you wouldn't operate heavy machinery under the influence of.
22:57  homekevin: Somebody could get hurt.
22:59  Miesco: Can you prepend a range in a / search
23:00  homekevin: Miesco: It looks like you cannot, but there are pattern elements for line numbers.
23:01  homekevin: :h /\%l
23:01  ws: Miesco:  if you do :(range)g/pattern/  then you can use n and N to find next/prev
23:01  Miesco: Can you have / highlight all the matches while your typing it?
23:02  homekevin: *all* the matches? No, I don't think so.
23:02  homekevin: That would make incremental search less useful I think.
23:03  Miesco: If you have hlsearch on, how do you get rid of the highlights?
23:03  homekevin: :noh
23:03  Dynetrekk: Miesco: :set nohlsearch, or search for xxx, or something like that
23:04  Miesco: really?
23:04  Miesco: Not like ctrl+l or something easy
23:04  bairui: vimgor nohl
23:04  vimgor: :nohl will disable current search highlighting until the next search is performed. A common map to avoid typing :nohl is ':nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :nohl<CR><C-l>'. See also, :help 'incsearch' and :help 'hlsearch'
23:04  homekevin: If you want to always not highlight, :set nohlsearch. No stop temporarily, :noh
23:05  homekevin: Oh, that's kind of an interesting mapping.
23:05  Miesco: oh neat
23:06  homekevin: I've been meaning to report this Vim bug for weeks, but I don't want to subscribe to vim-dev: https://gist.github.com/747740
23:06  fogobogo: say. the <Leader> is like an additional modifier key?
23:06  homekevin: If someone who's an vim-dev wants to forward it on, I'd appreciate it.
23:06  bairui: fogobogo: <leader> is Vim's answer to gobbling up all the useful keys in the first place.
23:06  homekevin: fogobogo: No, it doesn't act like a modifier.
23:06  fogobogo: hmm. ok
23:07  homekevin: It's a normal key, it's just configurable.
23:07  homekevin: In other words, it's the key you tell it to be.
23:07  bairui: fogobogo: as homekevin says, it's not a modifier, it should be pressed in sequence.
23:07  fogobogo: ah ok
23:07  homekevin: I wonder if it can be more than one key? let mapleader = "abc"
23:08  bairui: wouldn't that be useful!</sarcasm> :) If you want multi-key magic, maybe you'd like an abbreviation?
23:08  homekevin: Hey, it works!
23:09  homekevin: I don't know if you'd ever want to do it.
23:10  fogobogo: how i would hook up omnicompletion there? :map <Leader>o <CR>x<CR>o ?
23:10  homekevin: fogobogo: I don't think you want CR in that.
23:11  homekevin: fogobogo: And I suspect you want imap
23:11  fogobogo: damn right. thats carriage return. not control
23:11  bairui: fogobogo: mixing your metaphors.  <CR> = <Enter>   You want   <c-x><c-o>
23:11  homekevin: fogobogo: But imaps with <Leader> seem kind of screwy.
23:12  fogobogo: what would you suggest? ctrl-x ctrl-o is cumbersome and i have trouble finding a free key somewhere
23:12  homekevin: Think about the key sequence and ask yourself if you really expect to never need to type it out.
23:12  bairui: you'll get used to c-x c-o :)
23:13  bairui: at least it isn't meta-x-insert-omnicompletion   :D
23:13  fogobogo: uh ok. guess the pain in the wrists will wear of after a few weeks
23:13  bairui: you shouldn't be doing that too much anyway ;)
23:13  homekevin: No, the pain will never stop. But it'll be eased by the knowledge that you're not using Emacs.
23:14  fogobogo: bairui: if its gtk... you must.
23:14 * bairui doesn't miss verbose languages
23:14  homekevin: I've never used omnicomplete
23:15  homekevin: CTRL-N should be enough for anyone.
23:15  bairui: yeah, same here... *rarely*, and only then to see what all the fuss was about
23:15  fogobogo: CTRL-N is fine in mosr cases yeah
23:16  fogobogo: what i dont like with it is that you need to #include the header in every file before it triggers on the libs functions
23:17  bairui: fogobogo: perhaps you can solve that problem with a snippet (SnipMate) or macro...?
23:18  FernandoBasso: Funny ^w > increases the number of columns even if we are at the rightmost column. :)
23:18  fogobogo: hmm. maybe. ctags and omnicompletion is just a but less hassle
23:18  FernandoBasso: Feel crazy.
23:20  bairui: fogobogo: I am going to regret even mentioning this, but there is a plugin or two out there that maps the <Tab> key to (omni)completion. It isn't recommended, though, because it messes with the Tao of the universe.
23:20  bairui: vimgor SuperTab
23:20  vimgor: A plugin that tries to make tab do all kinds of things, including insert-mode completion. It tends to create more problems than it's worth though. http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643
23:20  Miesco: Can you open a buffer and replace the current buffer with it?
23:20  Miesco: Instead of having to do :bn
23:21  FernandoBasso: My rule with vim is to keep as naked as possible.
23:21  Miesco: there's ctrl+n
23:21  bairui: Miesco: use :e
23:21  Miesco: bairui: But if i'm in split mode it takes away split buffers
23:22  fogobogo: bairui: yeah ive seen a bunch of variations on this. that SuperTab though looks like a huge hack though. I simply prefer it to be in a way even my simple mind can follow
23:22  bairui: Miesco: really?
23:22  Miesco: bairui: really
23:22  bairui: fogobogo: you choose well, sir.
23:23  fogobogo: thanks
23:23  bairui: well, Miesco, I just use :e and my current window (split or not) is replaced with the buffer I requested. Perhaps I broke my configuration somehow...
23:25  Miesco: :h 42
23:28  Raimondi: :edit file  replaces the buffer in the current window with file...
23:29  bairui: (g'day, Raimondi. :) isn't that what he wanted? Maybe my reading-fu has decreased also... :-/
23:29  Raimondi: Good morning, bairui :)
23:29  Raimondi: I'm not sure what he wants...
23:30  bairui: nor is he :)
23:30  Raimondi: Yeah, that happens :)
23:30  bairui: lol
23:31  bairui: but, to be clear, Miesco, I'm not a total bastard, so if you'd like to restate your problem, you now have the awesome Raimondi on deck to help get a real solution. :)
23:33  Raimondi: Wow! that sounds pro, I almost ask a question myself :p
23:34  FernandoBasso: I am confused. NERDTree only accepts files as bookmarks. Not directories. Is this correct?
23:34  bairui: Raimondi: :p
23:36  bairui: sorry, FernandoBasso, not a big NT user... I tried... I just don't need much more than :e. Admittedly, it comes in handy *sometimes*. Perhaps I'm just not in touch with my inner browser.
23:36  FernandoBasso: I admit that I use very few plugins.
23:37  FernandoBasso: I'm trying to get used to this one, but it's not working out so far...
23:37  bairui: Use the :e, FernandoBasso.   (sounds way cooler with force and Luke, sorry :-/)
23:38  Raimondi: lol
23:38  FernandoBasso: May the force be with me, then.
23:38  bairui: there's the spirit! :)
23:38  Miesco: Whats the plugin for formating columns?
23:39  FernandoBasso: I have a blog, called jeditux ;)
23:39  bairui: vimgor align
23:39  vimgor: There are some plugins used to align text in a buffer. Align.vim is the most popular, but I've heard around that godlygeek's Tabular is a much better alternative, ask me about 'Tabular' for more info.
23:39  bairui: Miesco: --^
23:39  FernandoBasso: Because the tux is also a jedi. But nobody knows it.
23:40  bairui: I can see him with a light saber... righteously slashing through lesser OS... :D
