10:16  seku: vimgor: defining text-objects
10:16  vimgor: I don't know!
10:16  the_isz: vimgor: text-objects
10:16  vimgor: Text objects are half the fun of partying with Vim! To tell the truth, they're quite magical. So, if you don't want to be left out, read :help text-objects
10:17  seku: there was a nice link about defining them
10:17  seku: new ones
10:17  the_isz: seku: ok, sorry then
10:17  seku: no, thanks
10:17  seku: its just not what i was after
10:17  the_isz: seku: but note that you can /msg vimgor, too. so the whole channel doesn't need to attend your search :)
10:18  xixor: yo, how do you undo an undo again? like redo?

10:18  xixor: ah, thanks the_isz

10:25  bairui: ¡Buenas tardes, lads. :)
10:26  FernandoBasso: In Explore, the only way to gb (go to bookmark) is to use a number?
10:26  Raimondi: Hi there, bairui :)
10:26  FernandoBasso: bairui: Boa tarde.
10:27  bairui: D'oh! my cuteness backfired! Raimondi, help me out, dude! :) Hehe... g'day Raimondi. G'day, FernandoBasso. :) There we go... I should just stick to my own lingo. :p
10:27  Raimondi: That looks like portuguese to me, not much help available :)
10:27  FernandoBasso: I have to qb and then number gb?
10:28  bairui: sorry, FernandoBasso, I don't use netrw... :-/
10:28  Raimondi: But I think it's the same in portuguese, bairui :)
10:29  RusAlex: hi guys
10:29  Raimondi: Hi, RusAlex
10:30  RusAlex: when im switching from buffer to buffer, vim saves only line position in file, but i need also saved character position in line
10:30  RusAlex: Raimondi:
10:31  bairui: RusAlex: :help last-position-jump
10:31  RusAlex: ок
10:31  bairui: hmm... actually, I may have been a bit rash there... I assumed you meant between vim editing sessions, not just buffer jumps...
10:31  FernandoBasso: I was asking some question in vim_use, on google groups. I wish so much that posting with syntax highlighting was possible. The great majority of people there talk about vimscript. Plain text is murder.
10:32 --- xixor2 is now known as xixor
10:32  Dynetrekk: FernandoBasso: paste.pocoo.org has pasting for vim script I think?
10:33  FernandoBasso: Yeah, but it would be nice to have highlighting on the 'forum' itself.
10:33  FernandoBasso: There are forums, where we paste and have built in highlighting. It's way easier.
10:43  sktrdie: Hello
10:44  sktrdie: the auto-commenting star feature works for many syntax files, java, C etc... but not for PHP. Why is that?
10:44  sktrdie: I'm talking about when you write /**
10:44  sktrdie: and hitting enter automatically creates and indents a *
10:44  sktrdie: in PHP this doesn't work.
10:44  sktrdie: I have the set formatoptions+=or option set... but it doesn't work.
10:45  FernandoBasso: Try hitting tab instead.
10:45  FernandoBasso:  /*<tab>
10:46  FernandoBasso:   / and only one * and then <tab>
10:46  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: interesting! Why tab ? :(
10:46  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: in java i just hit return
10:46  FernandoBasso: I don't know.
10:46  sktrdie: after /**
10:46  sktrdie: ok well, thanks!
10:46  FernandoBasso: I only know in php /*<Tab> works.
10:46  sktrdie: i'll try and get used to
10:46  FernandoBasso: It is even one keystrok less.
10:46  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: but still, hitting enter again for multiline doesn't automatically add the *
10:47  FernandoBasso: It does here... Hmm.
10:47  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: ugh, weird
10:47  FernandoBasso: Let me see.
10:51  RusAlex: guys, last-position-jump it's for reopening files. but i need to save last position when im switching from buffer to buffer with bn,bp
10:51  RusAlex: vim remember only line number
10:51 --- Fernando1asso is now known as FernandoBasso
10:52  bairui: RusAlex: I noticed that earlier... however, I must say... I am confused by your request... When I switch between buffers, Vim puts me right where I was before - line and col. So... um, what's up with that?
10:52  sam_sam: !hello
10:53  RusAlex: hm  i don't know bairui
10:53  RusAlex: my vim saves only line number
10:53  bairui: what does   :set compatible?    say?   (the ? is needed)
10:54  RusAlex: bairui: nothin
10:55  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: Show us your vimrc.
10:55  bairui: nothing? that's not an option. It should say either   compatible   or   nocompatible
10:56  RusAlex: http://pastebin.com/y5BEgLEb
10:56  RusAlex: my vimrc
11:01  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: What does viewoptions? show?
11:01  FernandoBasso: Oh. I think it is only for mkview...
11:03  RusAlex: fuck my vimrc broken
11:04  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: Try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4251533/vim-keep-window-position-when-switching-buffers
11:08  iaj: i got a file which doesn't have an indent file - so > doesn't work off in that file - can I somehow fix that?h
11:08  RusAlex: now in start vim i see alot of errors in vimrc, but how i can to save them for inspecting ?
11:09  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: Did you copy that vimrc?
11:09  deitarion: Is there a less complicated motion than <Space>{{}}}←←←{<Enter> for creating a set of fold markers without accidentally expanding all folds following the line you're on?
11:09  deitarion: s/motion/sequence of keystrokes/
11:13  deitarion: (The space isn't required, but it's part of my formatting habits for adding fold sections to my .vimrc)
11:13  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: Just for a test, backup your vimrc file. Vim should save cursor positing on changing buffers by default
11:13  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: i will inspect now. where vim broke this feature
11:13  RusAlex: maybe some plugin
11:15  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: vim 2> vim_error.txt
11:18  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: no gvim don't use a save position by default
11:18  RusAlex: will try vim
11:19  RusAlex: yes, and vim don't save it too
11:19  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: Do you have any php plugin in ~/.vim/indent/ ?
11:19  RusAlex: i've removed my vimrc and .vim folder
11:19  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: What OS?
11:19  RusAlex: Ubuntu
11:19  bairui: deitarion: um, does   zf   not do something close to what you want?
11:20  deitarion: bairui: Huh. Hadn't noticed it did that. Any way to prevent it from interacting badly with the automatic comment marker feature to produce ""{{{ rather than "{{{?
11:21  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: Try with vim --noplugin
11:22  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: so with pure gvim and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4251533/vim-keep-window-position-when-switching-buffers it works
11:22  RusAlex: will try with my old vimrc
11:23  bairui: deitarion: that is determined by the 'foldmarker' option, IIRC. Have a read of   :help fold.txt
11:24  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: I dont have any plugin in indent... Mac os X
11:24  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: Perhaps, the default plugins shipped with your vim is different than mine.
11:24  deitarion: bairui: I don't get it. How does foldmarker="{{{,}}}" determine that the " indicating comment lines should be doubled up on inserting a fold marker?
11:24  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: yes it works with so solution
11:24  RusAlex: thanks
11:25  FernandoBasso: FernandoBasso: From stack overflow?
11:26  deitarion: bairui: What I'm saying is that, for some reason, it produces "{{{ and "}}} even if the lines already start with comment markers because pressing Enter/Return inside a comment block is "smart".
11:27  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: Try this one: http://www.2072productions.com/vim/indent/php.vim
11:27  FernandoBasso: Put in in ~/.vim/indent/
11:27  bairui: deitarion: :help fold-create-marker
11:28  deitarion: bairui: Ahh. Hadn't noticed that line. So, basically, it's a vim bug and my only recourse is to either remove the duplicated markers manually or write some kind of script which hijacks/wraps zf and fix it myself.
11:29  bairui: go the script/macro option! It's way more fun and your Vim-fu will increase. :D
11:30  bairui: then wrap it up in a plugin, publish it and create a vimgor entry for it. Profit! :)
11:30  deitarion: bairui: Already got enough ugly-script experience modding MiniBufExplorer++ to combine focus, toggle, and auto-hide behaviour I like and I still have to get around to debugging DetectIndent. More is not desired.
11:30  deitarion: The sooner I can get back to Python, the happier I'll be.
11:31  bairui: well, that's an option, I guess... you could do the scripting in python(ish)...
11:31  bairui: anyway, I'm done here for the night, lads. Have a good one, guys. G'night all. :)
11:31  deitarion: bairui: It's the vim API that's ugly.
11:31  deitarion: Vimscript isn't much worse than bash script.
11:31  bairui: deitarion: indeed - hence the (ish) part. :)
11:32  deitarion: Besides, I don't like adding dependencies unnecessarily.
11:35  deitarion: (It's one of the reasons all my PHP projects use Phing for their buildscripts and I wrote my own FAQ/guide to Python's distutils API after a lot of code diving despite it being easier to just use something like Pavement or Rake or Ant)
11:36  deitarion: s/Pavement/Paver/
11:36  deitarion: (pavement.py is the name of the makefile analogue)
11:41  sente: i currently have 'nmap <C-c> :.w! ~/.vbuf<CR>' as a mapping
11:43  sente: what's the best way to create a new type of mapping where i could use multiple vbuf's? i was thinking <M-C> $k would write to ~/.vbuf.$k
11:43  sente: but i don't know the best way to go about doing that
11:44  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: still not working
11:45  FernandoBasso: :/
11:45  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: i removed starting the plugins and it works
11:45  sktrdie: it must be snipMate cuasing some issues
11:45  FernandoBasso: Hmm. I use snipMate here.
11:45  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: do you have blog or other site with ads from google? i want to help you and will click on any ad, because you help me =)
11:46  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: But it sure can be a plugin conflic.
11:46  sktrdie: FernandoBasso: another question, when you do, public function set(){ <Enter>
11:47  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: No. I don't. Thanks. I am glad you solved your problem.
11:47  sktrdie: How can i make it autoindent of 4 chars, instead of having to hit tab everytime
11:48  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: I have this in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/php.vim: set softtabstop=4 expandtab shiftwidth=4
11:49  FernandoBasso: Oh. sktrdie I also have that problem. Also with css, but with css, if I disable autoclose it automatically adds the tab after {<Return>
11:52  FernandoBasso: Oh. No. I misunderstood your question at first. Here it does work fine.
11:53  FernandoBasso: sktrdie: Are you sure you (new) php.vim is being loaded?
11:53  sktrdie: guess so
11:53  FernandoBasso: :scriptnames
12:00  RusAlex: FernandoBasso: make a blog with google ads, and everyone which problem you solved will pay you via adwords =)
12:01  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: I know nothing about vim. About 1 or 2%. The others here would make much more money than me. hehe
12:02  RusAlex: but this is a good idea to pay for help via adwords
12:03  FernandoBasso: I'd like more having them help Bram with iccf. ;)
12:04  FernandoBasso: Vim is a Charity-ware software.
12:06  FernandoBasso: RusAlex: But if you really want to pay something, $1.000,00 will do.
12:07  FernandoBasso: I'll email you my bank account. Pay until the end of the day and we are fine.
12:07  tonymec: FernandoBasso: RusAlex: :help sponsor
12:08  FernandoBasso: tonymec: That should be in the very beginning of the help.
12:09  FernandoBasso: Not many people will jump to 'sponsor' or 'iccf' in vim :help.
12:10  tonymec: FernandoBasso: it is one of the alternating links you see near the middle of the splsh (:intro) screen.
12:10  FernandoBasso: I know.
12:11  FernandoBasso: But I don't believe many people actually ^] it.

12:13  carloratm: hi all
12:13  carloratm: n00b question here
12:13  FernandoBasso: No noob questions here.
12:14  FernandoBasso: Only vim ones.
12:14  FernandoBasso: :D
12:14  FernandoBasso: Go ahead!
12:14  carloratm: the spell checker built in vim seems not working in a file with xml tags, is it possible?
12:14  FernandoBasso: Moreover, no vim question is a noob question. All vim questions are high level questions.
12:17  FernandoBasso: I think spell do not work in programming languages file types. Or am I wrong?
12:18  carloratm: oh, bad news ;)
12:18  FernandoBasso: carloratm: I'm not sure, though.
12:20  FernandoBasso: haha 79 W -37 W (-47) W 7 W -29 W stop adding features, there are enough already  in vote_results. haha
12:22  FernandoBasso: carloratm: Try on other file types.
12:23  carloratm: in fact it works with plain text files
12:23  FernandoBasso: yeah. That is very correct.
12:24  FernandoBasso: If I recall correctly, someone here mentioned about spell not work on programming lang file types.
12:25  carloratm: but i have an xml that i need to transale, it has very long <para> tags full of text, i need spell checker :)
12:26  deitarion: Is there a way to unpack a vimball besides renaming my .vim, installing, and then renaming back? (I use pathogen to install scripts as overlays in ~/.vim/bundle/)
12:26  FernandoBasso: vim file.vba and then :source %
12:27  carloratm: could i say vim to treat a file like plain text ?
12:27  FernandoBasso: :set ft=txt.
12:27  FernandoBasso: :set filetype=txt
12:28  carloratm: FernandoBasso: great, now i can do spell checking
12:28  carloratm: then i set filetype back to xml
12:28  carloratm: and i'm done
12:28  FernandoBasso: Good!.
12:29  deitarion: I forget how, but it's possible to make spell selectively apply to certain syntax highlight types.
12:29  deitarion: I believe my Python setup spellchecks only docstrings, for example.
12:29  carloratm: oh so good i can use vim for translating, other than coding
12:31  FernandoBasso: carloratm: How do you do that?
12:32  carloratm: FernandoBasso: :set ft=txt | :setlocal spell spelllang=it | :set spell | :set ft=xml
12:34  ArunC: I used to run :make from my vim and suddenly it stopped working. It says: make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
12:34  FernandoBasso: You are translating from what lang to what lang?
12:34  ArunC: :!ls shows Makefile in current dir
12:35  carloratm: FernandoBasso: from english to italian
12:38  ArunC: Any hint?
12:38  lesnik_: hi
12:39  lesnik_: I`m using vim on linux. How can i type ^M character?
12:40  Raimondi: lesnik_: Ctrl-v Ctrl-m
12:42  lesnik_: Raimondi: thx. I tried it befeore, but i wasn`t in insert mode. :)
12:51  FernandoBasso: I need to replace every space after a ; in a given line <Return>. I tried :.s/;\zs /<CR>g but does nothing.
12:52  FernandoBasso: Hmm. It will not work anyway..
12:52  sqz: FernandoBasso: shift-v and then :s/ /foo/g  ?
12:52 --- MinceR_ is now known as MinceR
12:52  sqz: FernandoBasso: shift-v and then :s/; /;foo/g  ?
12:53  FernandoBasso: It inserts a literal <CR>. I needed it to break the line.
12:54  raccoon_: FernandoBasso: \r
12:54  FernandoBasso: Thanks.
13:01  sqz: whoohoo! another vim soul is helped \o/
13:03  sqz: I have a question: in Bram Moolenaars '7 habits of effective textediting' video, I was introduced with vimgrep and the quickfix window
13:03  sqz: what is the quickfix window, and how can it be usefull besides using it with vimgrep
13:18  deitarion: sqz: I use plugins which display syntax error listings in the quickfix window on save.
13:20  sqz: deitarion: ah ok, so the quickfix window can easily be used like a 'outputconsole' within vim
13:21  deitarion: The idea of the quickfix window is that, when properly configured, it provides a way to jump to reported problems to quickly fix them. (You can configure vim to recognize enough details from the tool's output format to know which file, line number, and column number to jump to)
13:22  lolzie: Hi guys - is there a key to effectively do this in one:  d$ i
13:22  lolzie: (i.e. delete after cursor and go straight to insert mode)
13:23  deitarion: I'm still getting the hang of commands like that, but is c$ what you want?
13:23  zomg: or C (shift+c)
13:23  kurkale6ka: lolzie: s
13:23  lolzie: zomg: that's the one :)
13:25  kurkale6ka: ah, ok, btw d$ is D
13:26  mattcodes: severals buffers open some quite far nested from the working directory. e.g. wd = user/matt. most files /user/matt/workspaces/xxx/ddd/aaa. several buffers open
13:26  mattcodes: I want to switch to buffer by part of file name
13:26  mattcodes: e.g. :e *server.config
13:27  mattcodes: how this best accomplished, whats annoying is am sure I had this working last week
13:27  kurkale6ka: :b
13:27  mattcodes: ah that was it. perfect
13:28  FernandoBasso: One of the most important invention for programmer is sure the use of snippets.
13:29  kurkale6ka: agreed
13:31  mattcodes: unless you are just shortcutting dont-repeat-yourself. a problem when you decide to change the behaviour/look of all that inserted snippets
13:31  FernandoBasso: I can imagine the old copy-from-somewhere-paste-in-my-program style.
13:31  FernandoBasso: mattcodes: Yeah. I sometimes change some of my snippets.
13:32  mattcodes: what are your most common snippets interested. not long into vim (previous VS/Resharper - live templates sometimes but only structural - e.g. loops etc.)
13:33  FernandoBasso: But I don't believe it will ever exist a better way.
13:38  FernandoBasso: mattcodes: Was is a question?
13:39  mattcodes: kind of just interested, ive ventured into NerdTree, but thats about the only other plugin im using (css/html/js/bash scripts primary target for me)
13:41  FernandoBasso: I use snipMate, autoclose, and surround most of the time.
13:43  FernandoBasso: But I never use the default snippets. Always my own ones.
14:04  FernandoBasso: We use things like ^r ^f to put text under cursor in in command line :. Is it possible to put comman line text into the buffer, besides using q:, copy and paste?
14:07  strull_: FernandoBasso: ^r:
14:08  FernandoBasso: strull_: When I am the the normal buffer? I inert mode?
14:09  FernandoBasso: :help
14:16  FernandoBasso: Where vim stores my recorded macro?
14:17  FernandoBasso: Can I save that macro in vimrc?
14:17  kurkale6ka: let @m='....'
14:21  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: m is the register where I recorde the marco?
14:21  kurkale6ka: yes
14:21  kurkale6ka: so let @m='^r^rm' in insert mode
14:21  kurkale6ka: or... "mp
14:23  FernandoBasso: Interesting. Thanks.
14:27  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Can I just put that let@='my_macro' line in vimrc?
14:27  kurkale6ka: you can FernandoBasso
14:28  kurkale6ka: but you could put it in a ftplugin dir too... ex: c_macros.vim
14:29  FernandoBasso: But I have a regexp in that macro, and now vim complain about pattern not found.
14:29  kurkale6ka: lemme see
14:34  FernandoBasso: Sory for the screenshot. I don't know how to print those chars in irssi: http://metabox.it/unK5R
14:34  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: ^
14:35  skizzhg: ops
14:37  kurkale6ka: FernandoBasso: what is @t supposed to do? Copy the whole line, paste twice above...
14:39  FernandoBasso: It is to copy the line, paste twice above, run .s/[ a-zA-Z]/*/g  then 2j and then that substitution again.
14:40  FernandoBasso: But vim is executing that line automatically when I open it.
14:40  kurkale6ka: I don't see any :s....
14:40  kurkale6ka: let @t="...:s///\<cr>..."
14:41  FernandoBasso: I recorded like this: qzYPP_mt2j_mt where _mt is a mapping to that regex.
14:42  FernandoBasso: Perhaps I should type that regext myself?
14:42  kurkale6ka: try to type it yes, :s....\<cr>
14:43  kurkale6ka: also use e -> :s///e
14:44  kurkale6ka: there is no error actually, only pattern not found
14:45  FernandoBasso: But why is it running the command when I open vim? Should it not say in t and run only when I @t?
14:46  kurkale6ka: shouldn't run it... did you try writing the regex?
14:47  FernandoBasso: Yeah. Same 'pattern not found' message.
14:47 --- wtfness is now known as foocraft
14:48  FernandoBasso: No. It is not the problem. I accidentally left a line behind...
14:48  FernandoBasso: Sorry for wasting your time.
14:48  FernandoBasso: Shame on me.
14:51  FernandoBasso: Just that it is not actually doing the substitution. It only copies the lines.
14:53  kurkale6ka: np, so solved then?
14:55  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Solved. Thanks very much.
15:02  FernandoBasso: I believe I can also build macros using ^v in insert mode to insert <Returns> and similar chars. Correct?
15:02 --- dhruvasagar is now known as zz_dhruvasagar
15:03  kurkale6ka: correct FernandoBasso
15:04  FernandoBasso: Oh. Vim is so amazing!
15:04  FernandoBasso: Prepare meal for the kids. Back later.
15:04  FernandoBasso: kurkale6ka: Thanks for all your time and help.
15:05  kurkale6ka: np FernandoBasso
15:08  sqz: hmm how can one do local autompletion (complete a word which is already in the document?)
15:08  sqz: CTRL x i ?

15:09  marlun: Someone who is using VimOrganizer?
15:09  marlun: I find it hard to understand how to use.
15:09  kurkale6ka: sqz: more precisely: ^x^p and ^x^n, ^p and ^n use many locations
15:10  kurkale6ka: :h^x^p

15:17  rson: kurkale6ka: indeed, i didn't realize that.  thanks.

15:46 --- silex is now known as Silex
15:48  Silex: hi, I'm trying to make something that finds lines containing div with class foo and deleting the whole div. I tried :g/div.*foo/normal d/<\/div
15:48  Silex: I then tried with recording a macro but for some reasons it doesn't seem to record my use of /
15:49  Silex: the macro was /div.*foo<CR>d/\/div<CR>dd

15:55  mgedmin: I would like to execute a command on entering netrw
15:55  mgedmin: my attempts
15:55  mgedmin: (e.g. creating .vim/ftplugin/netrw.vim)
15:55  mgedmin: are unsuccessful
15:55  mgedmin: the script appears to be executed when I'm _leaving_ netrw
15:56  Silex: kurkale6ka: ah, thanks
15:59  Silex: kurkale6ka: I think I want \_ tho, so it matches over newlines
16:00  kurkale6ka: sure
16:02  Silex: just curious, there's no way to make it work with :g ?
16:02  kurkale6ka: :g/foo/s/....
16:03  Silex: can you explain why :g/div.*foo/normal d/<\/div won't work?
16:03  strull_: Silex: I think your normal-command is not terminated
16:03  Silex: you mean I'd add a <CR> ?
16:04  strull_: yes
16:05  ManDay: Can anyone point me to the right help page on that:  Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim73/ftplugin/mail.vim
16:06  ManDay: ^ what is that and why does it change my .vimrc settings at will!?
16:06  ManDay: The only automation I want is for syntax highlighting and all that I EXPLICITLY say I want to have.
16:07  mgedmin: you must have said :filetype plugin on at some point ...
16:07  Silex: strull_: ah, it worked
16:07  ManDay: I see. I didn't though.
16:07  Silex: needed ^V then enter
16:07  ManDay: mgedmin: Any idea where the filetype plugin is loaded?
16:08  mgedmin: if not your .vimrc, then maybe /etc/vim/vimrc?
16:08  mgedmin: filetype plugins are disabled by default, something must have turned it on
16:08  mgedmin: usually these are goodness
16:08  mgedmin: if you dislike the standard mail ftplugin, you can create a ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/mail.vim to undo whatever it does wrong
16:08  ManDay: mgedmin: Urgh, I see
16:08  ManDay: you are right :)
16:09  ManDay: mgedmin: Yes, I have been told how to resolve this. I was just curious why it happens in the first place
16:09  ManDay: THanks
16:09  mgedmin: unfortunately :verbose filetype doesn't tell you where it was enabled
16:10  ManDay: Any idea how the filetype plugin finds out that it's a mail that I'm editing?
16:10  ManDay: I'm editing it without headers, from mutt
16:13  kongo: ManDay: you can have a look at $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim - there are most of the filetype detections
16:18  rson: ManDay: it's detecting mutt- in the filename most likely
16:19  ManDay: clever plugin :P
16:20  rson: ManDay: filetype.vim is ~2500 lines long, it's pretty smart :)
16:21  Nazcafan: hey
16:21  ManDay: rson: yeah, i guess its somewhat like Ubuntu
16:21  ManDay: rson: yeah, i guess its somewhat like Ubuntu's bash completion script for vim
16:22  Nazcafan: I would like to move to the beginning of my current {} () or [] context, is there a vim shortcut for that?
16:22  ManDay: (premature enter ;-D)
16:22  jerojasro: rson: that ain't a good metric - if it were, most java programs would be self-aware and we would have passed teh singularity...
16:22  rson: Nazcafan: %% would probably do it
16:22  rson: jerojasro: of course not, but if you take a look at it, you'd probably agree
16:22  jerojasro: :)
16:22  Nazcafan: rson, no it doesn't
16:22  rson: i knew someone was going to argue that :)
16:22  Nazcafan: rson, my cursor doesn't move
16:24  jerojasro: I'm just a waay too long java program; good thing is, no one notices in the internets
16:24  kongo: Nazcafan: there are movements like [{ and [(
16:24  rson: Nazcafan: indeed, it seems that only works for the current line
16:25  rson: kongo's suggestion works for me
16:25  Nazcafan: kongo, yeeees, thanks
16:26  kongo: np
16:26  kongo: Nazcafan: have a look at :h object-motions and :h various-motions as well

16:37  evantravers: I have a question about opening files over the network (FTP and SFTP) using the built in plugin
16:38  evantravers: After I've selected a file to work on, is there a way to open a file in the same remote directory without climbing through the login process again?
16:38  pigdude: evantravers: you could use an ssh key
16:39  evantravers: how would I go about doing that? all I basically want is to be able to jump between html/css files on a directory
16:39  evantravers: if it was local, all I would do is use :e [some file]
16:39  pigdude: evantravers: you want a broken auth mechanism?
16:39  evantravers: what do I do if I'm connected to remote?
16:39  pigdude: evantravers: to transparently authenticate, use an ssh key
16:39  evantravers: ok
16:40  pigdude: evantravers: I think ssh-agent can remember passwords for you also
16:40  pigdude: evantravers: but I haven't used it much
16:40  pigdude: evantravers: I am pretty certain vim will not remember passwords; I wouldn't be surprised if there is some plugin that does, but be careful
16:40  evantravers: i can do that, but how do I jump to another file without having to put in :e ftp://[the whole friggin] path
16:40  pigdude: evantravers: look at netrw
16:41  pigdude: evantravers: it allows you to "browse" the server
16:41  evantravers: hmm...
16:41  evantravers: ok
16:42  evantravers: that's what I've been using to open files pigdude, but I'm trying to figure out how to jump to a new file after opening the first without having to put the whole ftp thingo in there again
16:42  pigdude: evantravers: oh, and you know you can just edit the directory to see the listing
16:42  evantravers: yea
16:42  pigdude: evantravers: so do that
16:42  evantravers: that is really neat.
16:42  pigdude: evantravers: and open the files in other buffers
16:43  pigdude: evantravers: the listing won't go anywhere
16:43  evantravers: pigdude: how do i get back to the listing?
16:43  pigdude: evantravers: get back to it?
16:44  evantravers: so leave the listing in a buffer, and open each in a new?
16:44  pigdude: evantravers: sure
16:44  evantravers: i'm a bit n00bish, so you'd have to be slow with me.
16:44  pigdude: evantravers: I wouldn't be surprised if there is some command to recall the netrw buffer
16:45  pigdude: evantravers: I just don't use netrw too often
16:45  evantravers: yeah, it's not usually a huge issue, but it's pretty neat
16:45  evantravers: so i was trying to figure it out
16:45  pigdude: evantravers: anyway :h netrw-quickhelp may be a good place to begin
16:45  evantravers: ok

17:02  LeoNerd: I don't believe so..
17:02  LeoNerd: But I think syntax/sh.vim tries to detect if it's bash or not, and applies subtly different rules

17:05 * LeoNerd nod
17:06  LeoNerd: I believe it looks at the shebang line; make sure to put  #!/bin/bash
17:06  LeoNerd: which you should do anyway :)
17:07  evilgeenius: I have copied my .vim folder to my work-mates home folder but it is having no effect at all.   He doesn't normally use vim.  Any idea what could be wrong?
17:08  Geralt: LeoNerd: I do that, but the syntax thinks that ${var##somestring} is not valid in sh and hihglights the ## which it doesn't do in bash scripts, e.g. bashrc
17:08  LeoNerd: evilgeenius: Does a .vimrc exist?
17:08  malesca: evilgeenius: You probably also want ~/.vimrc and possibly ~/.gvimrc. What are you expecting to happen that does not?
17:08  Geralt: that's what got me wondering
17:08  LeoNerd: Geralt: Yup. That's because ${var##something} is a bashism
17:12  Geralt: LeoNerd: not according to http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html
17:12  seyfarth: Don't laugh, but for Windows does _gvimrc go in $VIM (program files\vim) or %home (%homepath%)?
17:12  LeoNerd: Hrmmm... Possibly the syntax file should be informed
17:13  sente: '$(cmd)' also causes annoyences with the sh.vim as well as 'cmd <<< $var'

17:14  sqz: ?
17:15  sqz: now I manually have to do :cw every time, which isn't a big problem, but its typical for me to do this after a grep

17:21  robgleeson: sorry!
17:22  sente: Geralt: i dont know i just know vim's syntax parsing gets royally f'd by it
17:30  bosie: i use } to jump over paragraphs
17:30  bosie: problem is, if i jump over a folded section, the folding opens up
17:30  bosie: is there a way that it just would jump over the folded section?
17:30  bosie: like j and gj do
17:44  mattcodes: I would like to add a mapping to go to the currently visible/active NERDTree window. I dont want to toggle, I dont want to use command NERDTree (as this creates new instance) and CTRL+W l is no good as I might have other splits vertically in between
17:49  mgedmin: mattcodes, if you know the number of the window, you can focus it with :exe nr . "wincmd w"
17:50  mgedmin: if you know the number of the buffer, you can find the number of the window with bufwinnr()
17:51  mgedmin: actually, you can also look them up by filename ... which is not going to help for nerdtree, I suspect
17:52  mgedmin: but you could loop through all buffer numbers (1 through bufnr("$")), check their filetypes (getbufvar(n, '&ft')), to find nerdtree's bufnr
18:02 * pattern has been playing around with vim's netbeans interface
18:03  pattern: it's kind of hackish and very limited in what it can send to/from vim
18:04  pattern: but i think it might almost be enough to allow a shell to be embedded in vim
18:04  mgedmin: wasn't there a patch for embedding a shell in vim?
18:04  mgedmin: what was it called .... ?
18:04  mgedmin: conque or something
18:04  pattern: i've heard there was some old plugin that did it
18:04  pattern: but it's really old and unmaintained
18:05  pattern: so probably won't work with newer vims
18:06  pattern: the main problem with the netbeans interface is that it doesn't tell you literally which keys the user hits at any time
18:06  homekevin: sente: Have you looked at sh.vim's options?

18:34  elb0w: E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: let g:colors_name="twilight"
18:35  homekevin: So you want a color scheme, not a syntax file.
18:35  elb0w: meant syntax highlighting sorry
18:35  homekevin: No, you meant color scheme
18:35  elb0w: Ok, color scheme
18:35  elb0w: sorry
18:35  homekevin: Syntax files describe the syntax of some type of file, like C, Python, etc.
18:35  elb0w: spacing etc?

18:46  mgedmin: find the pid of tee and sudo kill it from a different term
18:46  torio: I obviously did overwrite my /etc/hosts file..and as it is open in window, thought if I get back to it, can discard changes..but seem to be lost on how to do that..
18:46  torio: mgedmin: nice idea..let me check!!
18:47  mgedmin: and the command you wanted is :w !tee /etc/hosts
18:47  mgedmin: (space before ! important)
18:47  torio: mgedmin: yep..keep forgetting it..and keep forgetting that I defined <Leader>sw in order not to remember it
18:47  peter_w: more like :w /etc/hosts?

19:54  elb0w: I assumed it was on then? no?
19:55  gkatsev: yeah, they will.
19:55  gkatsev: but they don't enable syntax highlighting
19:55  elb0w: ok, how do I enable syntax
19:55  gkatsev: elb0w: :syntax enable   :filetype plugin indent on
19:55  gkatsev: you can either type those in as commands
19:55  gkatsev: but you should also probably put it in the vimrc file
19:55  gkatsev: elb0w: also, you should probably run through vimtutor, if you haven't already.
19:56  elb0w: I have a .viminfo file
19:56  gkatsev: elb0w: not the same.
19:56  elb0w: Yeah, I wanted to see if it was easy enough to do my colors first
19:56  elb0w: so I can look like im working while I change my colors haha

19:57  tangledhelix: xh: the question mark just tells vim to tell you the current value
19:57  elb0w: haha

20:23  elb0w: that did it

22:22  wooden: FernandoBasso: Yeah, I didn't map those.  I just do C-w h, and C-w l manually.
22:22  wooden: But you could change those mappings I did for up/down to right/left.

22:41  FernandoBasso: Oh.
22:41  graywh: in that case, your terminal is probably catching it

22:54  FernandoBasso: I don't know why people only think in the gvim when designing a colorscheme. It seems the most people use vim rather than gvim, and even those who use gvim use also vim in a terminal.
22:56  wooden: There are conversion utilities for going from gvim to vim colorschemes.
22:57  ws: wooden:  FernandoBasso just mentioned he uses one
22:57  wooden: Oh, is that what CSApprox is?
22:57  iPoLL: yes
22:58  iPoLL: but your terminal has to support 256 colors if the colorscheme is 256

23:02  homekevin: sven^: tput colors

23:07  peth: ceej: don't use -n. it will never use swap files, which have their use.
23:07  homekevin: sven^: Only if it supports more.
23:07  peth: FernandoBasso: try shortmess+=A
23:08  peth: uh, ceej ^
23:08  homekevin: sven^: I'm pretty sure some version of rxvt supports 256 colors
23:08  sven^: ok, I'll check out some docs. I compiled it with "256 color support", so it should work in some way. Thanks
23:08  FernandoBasso: ceej: I agree with peth.

23:08 --- zz_dhruvasagar is now known as dhruvasagar
23:08  ceej: set shortmess+=A
23:08  FernandoBasso: You must Rather configure vim to save your swap file correctly.
23:08  homekevin: sven^: There's a difference between the number of colors the terminal supports and the number of colors terminfo thinks it supports.
23:09  homekevin: sven^: You have to set TERM to something appropriate for the terminal to make them agree.
23:09  peth: yes, agreed. preferably that, and if absolutely impossible, set shortmess+=A will not warn you about pre-existing ones

23:18  homekevin: sven^: That's probably fine, assuming there's not an existing terminfo entry you can use. You don't need to rebuild the .deb (I assume you realize that)
