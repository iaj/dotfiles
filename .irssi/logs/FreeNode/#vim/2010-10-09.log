16:52  callumacrae: Where's my $VIM directory? I'm using Mac OS X
16:52  rudi_s: callumacrae: :echo $VIM
16:52  callumacrae: thanks
16:53  rudi_s: np
16:57  callumacrae: [noob] how do I install plugins?
16:57  alex-kun: Shurakai: ok... I hope there is a way to make compiler to show you errors in vim...  By the way I can find it in manual or it is some kind of plugin_
16:57  callumacrae: It says to type :helptags $VIM/doc, which just errors
16:58  alex-kun: callumacrae: just extract it in ~/.vim
16:58  callumacrae: :/
16:58  callumacrae: folder cannot be found
16:59  alex-kun: windows linux?
16:59  callumacrae: It said to put it in $VIM/plugin, so I did
16:59  callumacrae: Mac OS X
16:59  rudi_s: callumacrae: No, put it in ~/.vim/
16:59  alex-kun: I think it is in Applications
16:59  rudi_s: mkdir ~/.vim if necessary
17:00  callumacrae: ~ = callumacrae, right?
17:00  alex-kun: no Mac X have different system
17:00  rudi_s: (Btw. you shouldn't have write access in /Applications/)
17:00  rudi_s: callumacrae: ~ = /Users/callumacrae/
17:00  rudi_s: ~ = $HOME
17:00  rudi_s: echo $HOME
17:00  callumacrae: thanks
17:00  alex-kun: Or libraries some thing in user folder
17:00  rudi_s: alex-kun: No, scripts should be installed in ~/.vim in mac as well.
17:00  alex-kun: oh? ok
17:01  callumacrae: There are load of vim files in ~/
17:01  callumacrae: :/
17:01  rudi_s: alex-kun: /Application is only for global data, like /usr/share and a normal user shouldn't have write access there.
17:01  rudi_s: callumacrae: ?
17:01  callumacrae: are why are hidden folders such a pain :(
17:01  callumacrae: I've put it in ~/.vim/
17:01  rudi_s: callumacrae: Because Mac hides them ;-)
17:02  rudi_s: open ~.vim in the terminal lets you open it.
17:02  alex-kun: I m actually using ubuntu on Mac
17:02  rudi_s: open ~/.vim
17:02  rudi_s: Ubuntu on Mac?
17:02  alex-kun: yeah XD
17:02  callumacrae: opened it
17:02  rudi_s: alex-kun: Ubuntu on Apple hardware?
17:02  alex-kun: extract all there
17:02  alex-kun: Yes
17:02  alex-kun: It s like a dream
17:03  callumacrae: I have - autoclose.vim now :)
17:03  rudi_s: alex-kun: Isn't that a waste of money?
17:03  rudi_s: callumacrae: Great ;-)
17:03  callumacrae: now what? :/
17:03  callumacrae: "Not an editor command: AutoCloseOn"
17:03  rudi_s: callumacrae: If you put it in ~/.vim/plugin/, restart vim and it should get loaded.
17:03  alex-kun: now open vim
17:03  callumacrae: wait, in /plugin?
17:04  rudi_s: callumacrae: Yes, as the documentation said, you wrote it above.
17:04  callumacrae: okay
17:04  alex-kun:  
17:05  alex-kun: rudi_s: No. It works perfectly... I actually don't like Mac OS
17:05  rudi_s: alex-kun: I can understand that .. but why buy an apple computer then?
17:05  callumacrae: They're shiny :)
17:06  alex-kun: rudi_s: they have dessent configuration and work well
17:07  rudi_s: alex-kun: Hm, and pricey .. anyway, it's your money ;-)
17:07  callumacrae: the only problem with this plugin is that it hasn't got a shortcut to skip a character..
17:07  callumacrae: kinda defeats the point of auto closing stuff
17:08  alex-kun: rudi_s: it was about 800 Euro
17:08  rudi_s: callumacrae: Maybe the docs mention anything.
17:08  callumacrae: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2009 bit useless really

19:11  leotr: rudi_s: hmmm... there is such line: :filetype indent on
19:12  rudi_s: leotr: Hm, then it should work if BASIC provides an indent file. Check :e $VIMRUNTIME/indent/basic.vim
19:13  rudi_s: If not it won't work.
19:15  leotr: there is no such file... is it possible to download it somewhere?
19:33  Oleg_: how do I go to a new line when a cursor is at the beginning of the current line?
19:33  Oleg_: simple enter doesn't work in this case
19:34  Oleg_: I mean, it works, but simply put the current line one position lower
19:34  Oleg_: but if I simply wanna go to a new line, when a cursor is at the beginning of a current line, what should I do?

21:06  sako: ##.

22:05  rudi_s: uhsf: Load the file in the correct encoding.
22:05  rudi_s: vimgor: enc
22:05  vimgor: Vim has multiple settings for encodings: 'encoding' sets Vim's internal encoding (should be utf-8), 'fileencoding' sets the encoding of a file, 'fileencodings' (s) are encodings tried when opening a file. If Vim doesn't detect the encoding correctly, use :e ++enc=encoding filename to force the given encoding. If possible try it in GVim or terminal encoding problems might interfere.
22:05  rudi_s: uhsf: ^
22:10  G-Brain: when i try to move the cursor past the end or before the beginning of a line or file, the screen refreshes. how do i make this not happen?
22:10  Araxia: infid: if you map caps lock to control, <C-h> is all home row.
22:12  rudi_s: G-Brain: Refreshes as in visual bell?
22:13  uhsf: i tried many ":set enc=..." but it only changes <> characters to ? in losange
22:13  rudi_s: G-Brain: Try set vb t_vb= :h'vb for more information
22:13  rudi_s: uhsf: Do you know the encoding of the file?
22:13  G-Brain: rudi_s: in the terminal i guess that would be it. i'm experiencing the same in gvim. repeated keypresses make the screen flicker
22:13  rudi_s: G-Brain: Try to set it in gvimrc.
22:13  infid: Araxia: i have it mapped to control already, c-h retreats the cursor unlike delete though. hmm
22:14  uhsf: the text displays correctly in firefox with iso-8859-1
22:15  rudi_s: uhsf: :e ++enc=latin1 doesn't work? Sure your setup is right?
22:16  G-Brain: rudi_s: :set vb t_vb= does it. thank you very much!
22:16  rudi_s: You're welcome.
22:17  uhsf: rudi_s: it think it's ok now. i didn't know ":e ++enc" i thought ":set enc" was enough, i will note this command to remember
22:18  rudi_s: vimgor: enc
22:18  vimgor: Vim has multiple settings for encodings: 'encoding' sets Vim's internal encoding (should be utf-8), 'fileencoding' sets the encoding of a file, 'fileencodings' (s) are encodings tried when opening a file.

22:18  rudi_s: uhsf: Please read that.
22:18  rudi_s: And :h 'enc', never change enc when vim is running, use fenc to change the encoding when writing, and :e ++enc= to change the encoding when opening a file.

22:35  Yxven: this is my vimrc file http://vim.pastey.net/141359-1tw2
22:37  rudi_s: Yxven: Is :set ft the same in all files?
22:38  jaggz-: there *is* a fixed vim which doesn't lock up when returning from ^z/suspend no?  In my debian they still don't have newer than 7.1.314
22:38  rudi_s: vimgor: mswin
22:38  vimgor: You're probably looking for the mswin.vim entry
22:38  jaggz-: and I hvae to hit ctrl-c every time I suspend, run some commands, and come back
22:38  rudi_s: vimgor: mswin.vim
22:38  vimgor: mswin.vim is evil and wrong. It breaks visual mode and changes the behavior of a large number of keys. Disable it by either removing the :source mswin.vim from $VIM/_vimrc, removing mswin.vim from $VIMRUNTIME, or put 'let g:skip_loading_mswin=1' in your _vimrc
22:38  rudi_s: Yxven: ^ - don't use mswin.vim
22:38  zarac: this abs stuff confuses me
22:38  zarac: : )
22:39  rudi_s: jaggz-: Works fine for me here. Sometimes I have to press Ctrl-c, but then everything works fine.
22:39  rudi_s: zarac: abs?
22:40  zarac: arch build system
22:40  jaggz-: if I return directly, without any commands, it's fine.. but otherwise I have to hit ctrl-c
22:40  rudi_s: Ah, okay.
22:40  zarac: =D
22:41  rudi_s: jaggz-: Yeah, me to from time to time. Not sure how to fix this.
22:44  zarac: rudi_s: oh, i thought i was in the archlinux channel now.. : )
22:44  zarac: i want vim with python support.. : )
22:45  rudi_s: ;-)
22:46  Yxven: rudi_s: I commented out mswin,and I apparently only pasted half of my vimrc http://vim.pastey.net/141360
22:47  rudi_s: Yxven: Check :set ft in both files.
22:48  Yxven: rudi_s: it works right if I open the file directly from the command prompt, but it fails when I open it from within gvim with : tabe
22:48  rudi_s: ft?
22:49  Yxven: yes they have the same file type according to : set ft
22:49  rudi_s: Yxven: Hm, try :verbose set whatever-option-that-is-false
22:50  Yxven: I'm sorry. Do you mean exactly like that? Or should I be looking for an option name?
22:51  rudi_s: Yxven: :verbose set
22:51  rudi_s: And then the option name that is wrong.
22:54  Yxven: when I type in the file that works right, it says shift width is 4 set from my vim rc file. In the broken file it says 8 and doesn't say from where it got that setting
22:55  rudi_s: Yxven: Hm, then I've no idea. It should tell you where it was last set. I hope anybody has an idea.
22:55  Yxven: rudi_s: thank you for trying
22:55  rudi_s: np
22:59  Raimondi: Yxven: Why are you using setlocal in your vimrc?
23:00  Yxven: Raimondi: incompetence probably
23:01  Raimondi: When you do that, the first buffer gets the settings, but as they aren't accesible to new buffers
23:01  Raimondi: Just use  set
23:01  Yxven: thank you
23:01  Raimondi: setlocal is to be used for setting that affect just the current buffer, like filetype settings.
23:02  Raimondi: s/filetype/filetype related/
23:02  Yxven: I originally copied it from my file type settings and just didn't know any better
23:02  Yxven: thank you for explaining it
23:02  Raimondi: np
23:06  infid: anyone know if anyone has made an addon snipmate snippets file for php functions?, eg substr[tab] would do substr(string $string, int $start [, int $length] ) ?
23:06  infid: cant find one on google
23:06  infid: will make it my self if no one already has, but dont wanna waste my time reinventing any wheels
23:21  pigdude: infid: that snippets file would be tremendous

23:38  MikhX: better documentation workflow anyways
