11:58  KeeperOfTheSoul_: don't you just hate it when you've worked out some command sequence, forget to comment it and later can't remember what its supposed to be doing
12:11  KeeperOfTheSoul_: how do you detect if vim supports relative numbers?
12:12  mgedmin: exists('&rnu'), probably <-- KeeperOfTheSoul
12:12  mgedmin: yeah, that works
12:12  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah, needs the ampersand
12:13  KeeperOfTheSoul_: and also exists, not has, chears
12:14  KeeperOfTheSoul_: so is it better to use &rnu or +rnu ?
12:15  mgedmin: hm
12:15  mgedmin: depends if you want that option to work or not :)
12:16 * mgedmin had forgotten about exists("+option-name")
12:16  KeeperOfTheSoul_: why would there be an option that exists but doesn't work?
12:16  mgedmin: smaller builds do that sometimes
12:17  KeeperOfTheSoul_: hm? but shouldn't that just remove the option?
12:17  mgedmin: I dunno
12:18  mgedmin: maybe the reasoning is that this will prevent floods of errors in people's .vimrc when they launch something like vim.tiny
12:18  mgedmin: but that makes no sense, vim.tiny complained about all sorts of reasonable things in my .vimrc, like :let
12:18  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah suppose, I mean most people just expect the setting visualbell to exist
12:19  mgedmin: I can't shake the thought that this was described in :help somewhere
12:19  mgedmin: but I don't even remember the term it used for these pretend-options
12:21  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah, hidden-options
13:10  mgedmin: aaah!
13:10 * mgedmin accidentally opened a tab
13:13 * the_isz faints.
13:23  KeeperOfTheSoul_: mgedmin: heh, worse is that zz is very useful, but ZZ saves and exits, now that is just an accident waiting to happen
13:24  _rane: but it saves, so nothing is lost?
13:25  KeeperOfTheSoul_: _rane: unless you want to save (maybe mid-way through editing a commit message, or git rebase -i) but even so, still anoying
13:25  et: _rane: undo history is lost, also buffers if they were too big
13:26  et: s/buffer/registers/
13:26  mgedmin: vim 7.3 has persistent undo \o/
13:26  KeeperOfTheSoul_: I just map ZZ to zz
13:27  et: mgedmin: for real, or like it has persistent registers?
13:27  mgedmin: it's off by default, but you can enable it
13:28  mgedmin: then vim writes undo info into a separate file, and loads it, checking with a checksum that the file hasn't been modified behind vim's back
13:28  mgedmin: I believe there's an option to limit file size or something like that
13:29  paissad: hello, guys, when i do vim --version, i have no clipboard feature (-clipboard) ... do i need to recompile vim ?
13:29  KeeperOfTheSoul_: I really didn't know how much I needed relative line numbers until yesterday :)
13:29  paissad: or only something to set ?
13:30  KeeperOfTheSoul_: paissad: no, needs a re-compilation, though if you got it through some package system you probably have a lite version so can just grab a full version instead
13:43  paissad: KeeperOfTheSoul, i did not need to recompile :)
13:44  paissad: KeeperOfTheSoul, i just did "ln -svf /usr/bin/{gvim,vim}"
13:45  paissad: and it's ok now ... i remembered that from  a tip of godlygeek more than 1 year ago ^^
13:47  mgedmin: ugh
13:47  mgedmin: you must be using that weird distro that has different binaries for /usr/bin/vim and /usr/bin/gvim
14:01  lemmi: hi
14:02  FernandoBasso: hi
14:05  lemmi: could someone give me a hint, how i get vim to jump to an existing tab when using :make instead of opening a new buffer in the current tab?
14:07  jamessan: :help 'switchbuf'
14:08  KeeperOfTheSoul_: mgedmin: kind of makes sense? if things are going wrong have a light weight vim to fall back on when fixing the system
14:08  KeeperOfTheSoul_: mgedmin: I guess it assumes you'll set up standard users with a different path to prefer the full version
14:08  mgedmin: sure, make /bin/vi a lightweight vim
14:08  mgedmin: but having /usr/bin/vim with no x clipboard support is just dumb
14:08  KeeperOfTheSoul_: oh, its that way round, ok that is odd
14:09  lemmi: jamessan: thnx

20:29 --- Channel #vim was synced in 73 seconds
20:29  krz: im giving vim another try
20:30  krz: im on mac. using macvim. need to install plugins. should i use pathogen?
20:30  Raimondi: pathogen makes it easy to uninstall plugins, so I think it's a good idea to have it.
20:31  krz: is it possible to keep nerdtree open all the time?
20:31  Raimondi: The version at GitHub has a aefture to deactivate plugins, so you don't even have to uninstall them
20:33  krz: Raimondi: ive put pathogen.vim in ~/.vim/
20:33  krz: now what do i do?
20:34  Raimondi: Where in ~/.vim?
20:34  krz: root folder
20:34  Raimondi: Move it to ~/.vim/autoload
20:34  krz: at ~/.vim/pathogen.vim
20:34  krz: ok so ill create a new folder called autoload
20:34  Raimondi: Yes
20:35  krz: this works for macvim too right?
20:35  Raimondi: Yes
20:35  krz: ok its in autoload
20:35  krz: now what?
20:35  Raimondi: Have you created your ~/.vimrc file?
20:36  krz: no
20:36  ezzieyguywuf: whats the difference between 0 and g0 ?
20:36  Raimondi: That should be your next step
20:36  Raimondi: vimgor vimrc
20:36  vimgor: Try typing :help vimrc-intro and check out <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file>. Also try the #vim approved example vimrc at <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc>.
20:36  Raimondi: krz: ^
20:36  strull_: ezzieyguywuf: :he g0
20:37  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: what didn't you understand in the description in :help?
20:37  ezzieyguywuf: DHulme: not really. I'mready motions.txt right now fpi
20:37  Raimondi: krz: See what do you like from those links and copy that to your vimrc.
20:40  Raimondi: krz: To activate pathogen put "call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()", without the quotes,  at the beggining of your vimrc, before  filetype plugin indent on
20:40  krz: ok i created a vimrc file that looks like http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc
20:41  Raimondi: krz: To activate pathogen put "call pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles()", without the quotes,  at the beggining of your vimrc, before  filetype plugin indent on
20:42  krz: ok
20:42  krz: ill just put it at line one. is that ok?
20:43  Raimondi: Yep, unless you will use that vimrc on other systems.
20:43  krz: ok whats the next step :-)
20:44  Raimondi: Now you can install plugins into ~/.vim/bundle
20:44 --- Natch is now known as Natch|
20:44  krz: ah ok
20:44  krz: thanks will try it out now
20:44  Raimondi: Let's say you install test.vim, place it i ~/.vim/bundle/test/plugin/test.vim
20:45  krz: so if i install nerdtree, it goes to ~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree/plugin/nerdtree.vim ?
20:45  krz: does it have to have the same dir structure?
20:46  graywh: each path listed in 'runtimepath' follows the same structure
20:46  Raimondi: Yes, keep the dir structure inside bundle
20:46  graywh: most bundles will come with their own structure
20:46  Raimondi: inside bundle/nerdtree
20:51  krz: thanks Raimondi looks like its working :-)
20:51  Raimondi: Good :)
20:51  Raimondi: Do you know that MacVim can be used from the terminal too?
20:52  krz: hmm
20:52  krz: i tried macvim file_name
20:52  krz: didnt work
20:52  squ: try vim
20:52  krz: i think i need to have this in my environment?
20:52  krz: yea vim works
20:52  krz: i forget. how to switch views?
20:52  krz: wv?
20:52  Raimondi: No, yuo need to install mvim, it comes with MacVim
20:53  Raimondi: vim will start the system Vim, which is outdated
20:53  squ: vim is for oldschool guys
20:53  krz: i have macvim
20:54  squ: teens use macvim
20:54  krz: mvim returns -bash: mvim: command not found
20:54  _rane: Raimondi: nooo
20:54  krz: what do you guys use ?
20:54  _rane: mvim is MacVim
20:54  _rane: but
20:54  _rane: MacVim comes with command-line vim also
20:54  krz: squ: what do you use instead of vim?
20:54  _rane: /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim
20:54  Raimondi: _rane: He needs to install mvim first, then create the symlinks
20:55  squ: krz, I use vim and gvim
20:55  krz: ok
20:55  krz: i have 2 vertical split window. how do i navigate to one window?
20:55  squ: they both are accurate
20:55  squ: but gvim changes fonts
20:56  squ: and sometime if you read unicode it is easier to configure
20:56  Raimondi: vimgor: buffers
20:56  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
20:56  Raimondi: krz: ^
20:56  squ: krz, CTRL+W is for window command
20:56  squ: next is the same as in vim normal mode
20:57  krz: ah yes ctrl+w
20:57  krz: i used vim a long time ago
20:57  krz: just getting back to it
20:57  squ: yeah I found that forget vim commands is very easy
20:57  squ: some weeks at sunny beach with girls
20:57  squ: and you forget a word motion command
20:58  krz: heh, thats why i love my ide
20:58  squ: but still vim cant be beaten by anythng
20:58  squ: even emacs has vim mode
20:58  krz: is mksession recommended to save buffer sessions? or is there a better alternative?
21:01  krz: Raimondi: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159 goes in bundler/ ?
21:01  krz: or do i have to create directories for this plugin, inside bundle/ ?
21:01  ezzieyguywuf: so, are (,- and other punctuation marks considered their own words for the purposes of w ?
21:02  Raimondi: Create a dir ~/.vim/bundle/minibufexplorer/plugin and copy the file there.
21:02  krz: ah
21:02  squ: ezzieyguywuf, this is defined with 'iskeyword'
21:02  Raimondi: every script shoud reside in its own directory inside bundle
21:02  squ: ezzieyguywuf, if char is there, then it is word
21:03  Raimondi: krz: whit the correspongind dir structure.
21:03  krz: yeap works now
21:03  krz: thanks :-)
21:03  Raimondi: np
21:03  krz: anyone use nerdtree here?
21:04  Raimondi: vimgor anyone
21:04  vimgor: Please do not ask if anyone uses, knows, is good with, can help you with or is a guru/expert of <some program>. Instead, ask your real question. You'll probably get help faster that way.
21:04  Raimondi: krz: ^
21:04  ezzieyguywuf: squ: so 192-255 includes a bunch of punctuation I'm assuming?
21:05  krz: was wondering if i can have nerdtree remember the current dir whenever i reopen macvim
21:05  SandCube: how to make vim execute the command ":TlistSessionLoad <file name>" on startup?
21:05  ezzieyguywuf: SandCube: add to .vimrc
21:05  Raimondi: ezzieyguywuf: That wouldn't work, plugins are loaded _after_ vimrc
21:06  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, about the punctuation question: :h word
21:06  ezzieyguywuf: Raimondi: maybe ftplugin then?
21:06  SandCube: ezzieyguywuf, how to do it? just include this line as is?
21:06  Raimondi: SandCube: Use an autocmd, see :h VimEnter
21:07  SandCube: thanks, I will check it out
21:07  Accolade: SandCube, but you have to put in vimrc anyway
21:07  Raimondi: ezzieyguywuf: Depending of what you want, an ftplugin could work too, for specific filetype
21:07  ezzieyguywuf: Accolade: yea I'm reading that. "sequence of letters, digits or underscores, or a sequence of other non-blank characters separated by whitespace". I would think that a-word and a_word would both be just one word, but w skips to the punctuation in both cases.
21:07  Accolade: Raimondi, what's the advantage of the autocmd here?
21:08  Raimondi: plugins are loaded after the vimrc, so yuo can't call plugin's functions or commands
21:08  Raimondi: from teh vimrc
21:08  squ: ezzieyguywuf, I dont know. Would you investigate?
21:08  squ: ezzieyguywuf, but if you want to make ) word, just :set iskeyword+=)
21:09  Raimondi: but the VimEnter event is fired after the start up process has finished.
21:09  Raimondi: Accolade: ^
21:09  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, strange, not for me - to the dash yes, but not the underscore
21:09  ezzieyguywuf: squ: that's the thing: I don't want ) to be a word. If I have the following text "1 2aword 3another_word 4another-word 5some(more)_text 6\somethingelse" I want w to jump to the number each time
21:10  ezzieyguywuf: Accolade: I was mistaken about the underscore.
21:10  Accolade: Raimondi, ik. I guess I'm lacking the knowledge what :TlistSessionLoad is, then
21:10  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: use W for that
21:11  ezzieyguywuf: squ: actually, in a tex file (which I do set isk+=: on) the underscore thing happens.
21:11  squ: ezzieyguywuf, add 'space' as word
21:11  ezzieyguywuf: DHulme: ah yea, good point
21:11  ezzieyguywuf: ok, but if I have "some (stuff) and \maybe {some more}" I don't want w to ever go to the ( or \ or {
21:12  squ: ezzieyguywuf, add ( \ { as word
21:14  squ: tonight is rare star rainy even do you know?
21:14  squ: event
21:15  ezzieyguywuf: ok, so I added 33-47 to isk, but w still stops on _, ( etc
21:16  Scala: squ: Tonight is what?
21:16  squ: you can just +=)
21:16  squ: not by char ascii index
21:16  squ: Scala, rainy event
21:17  squ: a rainy by stars
21:17  peth: ezzieyguywuf: you're trying to shoot yourself in the foot here. use W, or map-swap W and w.
21:17  Scala: squ: What does that mean? Shooting stars?
21:17  squ: they fall 100sph (star-per-hour)
21:17  squ: make different vectors
21:17  squ: different by length and width
21:17  Accolade: squ, ezzieyguywuf, I guess that won't work, as w goes to the beginning of a word and the brackets in word characters, "(" is the first char of the word "(stuff)"
21:18  SandCube: Accolade, Raimondi, ezzieyguywuf, got it working! thanks all!
21:18  Accolade: * and with the brackets in word characters
21:18  squ: Accolade, and he want to move so 's' ?
21:18  Accolade: squ, what?
21:18  squ: in word "(stuff)"
21:18  Accolade: squ, he wants to move to 's', yes
21:18  ezzieyguywuf: SandCube: no prob
21:19  ezzieyguywuf: Accolade: that is right
21:19  squ: then I agree with you and think it is impossible
21:19  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, you could :map w /[^a-z]\zs[a-z]<cr>
21:20  ezzieyguywuf: heh...
21:21  squ: ezzieyguywuf, would you please check WORD in help
21:21  squ: for example if you exclude the a-z in it
21:21  Accolade: squ, he knows that, but it doesn't fix (all of) his problem
21:21  squ: it will jump thru ()_ space and {
21:21  Scala: squ: Thanks for letting me know about the stars, I'll probably stay up late tonight to see if I can see any
21:22  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, what's funny? :)
21:22  squ: Scala, it is awesome but you must not look into pc, and really stare at sky
21:22  ezzieyguywuf: I guess basically what I want is for w to only jump to alphanum chars
21:22  squ: Scala, because they are fast
21:22  squ: and leave no trails
21:22  ezzieyguywuf: Accolade: nothing funny, just me laughing at myself cuz now I have to go :h map
21:22  ezzieyguywuf: :-P
21:22  Spidey01: No Scala on trails?
21:22  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, ah right, then it's :map w /[^a-z0-9]\zs[a-z0-9]<cr>
21:23  Spidey01: Sometimes, I have just got to be an ass for the sake of it lol - it's my sense of humour
21:23  squ: Spidey01, falling leonidas leave no tails, smoky marks on sky etc
21:23  squ: :)
21:23  Spidey01: hehe
21:23  Scala: Spidey01: I don't get it D:
21:24  DHulme: Accolade, ezzieyguywuf: wouldn't /\< be simpler and more reliable
21:24  DHulme: and it also has the advantage of looking like a duck's head
21:24  squ: DHulme, it is word
21:24  Accolade: DHulme, yes, good point
21:24  squ: \< is word :)
21:24  ezzieyguywuf: Accolade: that works great as a hack for w, but really I want to define isk properly b/c I still need b to work properly, plus that hilights all alfanum in my file which is annoying :-P
21:24  squ: but they dont want to redefine iskeyword, am I right?
21:25  ezzieyguywuf: no, I do want to redefine iskeyword
21:25  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: you can't set isk in such a way that w skips across non-word characters
21:25  Spidey01: Scala: he said  "Scala, because they are fast";  Scala is also the name of a programming language, that in some cases could be seen as a competitor to the Ruby (on Rails) crowd
21:25  Accolade: you can't do it with isk
21:25  Spidey01: Freakishly my brain cliques little odd thoughts like that all the time
21:26  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, :map w /\<<CR>:noh<CR>
21:26  ezzieyguywuf: DHulme: Accolade hrm.
21:26  squ: Spidey01, there is also new language developed by google (r)
21:26  squ: :)
21:26  Scala: Spidey01: I know about Scala ;)
21:26  Spidey01: squ: I like Go, but have never gotteninto Scala
21:26  ezzieyguywuf: so I'm the only one that gets annoyed using w when theres lots of (),{}, or other punctuation, like in a tex file?
21:26  Scala: I'm about to learn Scala because it's my namesake :D
21:26  squ: I think they will stop making new languages only when they will be forced to learn each.
21:27  Scala: (and it'll round out my programming lang knowledge)
21:27  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: guess so
21:27  squ: banks still use delphi
21:27  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: I don't get annoyed when w and W do what they're supposed to do
21:27  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, you might consider / as an alternative
21:27  Scala: ezzieyguywuf: use f and t more ;)
21:27  DHulme: ezzieyguywuf: do you know about f F t and T
21:28  squ: just suggest ezzieyguywuf to stick with what is available without tweaking
21:28  krz: how does one start fuzzyfinder?
21:28  krz: i have it installed but dont see it anywhere
21:28  DHulme: krz: there's a selection of commands starting :Fuf
21:28  squ: also, with latex (which is he talking about) there is plugin with placeholders
21:28  ezzieyguywuf: Scala: lol, f and t are ok I suppose.
21:28  krz: buffer explorer
21:28  squ: when you press ctrl+j it cycle thru common positions
21:28  ezzieyguywuf: squ: I think I'll try that
21:28  DHulme: krz: it's usual to map things to them; for instance, I have \b for :FufBuffer<CR> and \t for :FufTag<CR>
21:28  ezzieyguywuf: just use vim as it is. lots of thought has gone into its design I suppose.
21:28  squ: ezzieyguywuf, its vim-latex-suite
21:29  ezzieyguywuf: squ: I got rid of latex-suite alreday
21:29  Accolade: ezzieyguywuf, speaking of which, the :map w /\<<CR>:noh<CR> will replace the last search pattern, which would be fixable with a little more scripting. But f might be sufficient, yes :)
21:29  squ: ezzieyguywuf, have you tried placeholders?
21:29  squ: they just do what are you talking here for an hour
21:29  ezzieyguywuf: squ: :h placeholders?
21:29  squ: vim does not have it
21:29  squ: it was vim-latex-suite extension
21:29  krz: it says not an editor command: Fuf
21:30  ezzieyguywuf: meh, like I said I just got rid of latex-suite per #vim recommendations
21:30  squ: krz, what command?
21:30  krz: :Fuf
21:30  DHulme: krz: it's commands *starting with* :Fuf
21:30  ezzieyguywuf: vimgor latex-suite
21:30  vimgor: An slightly-maintained, buggy, over-complicated plugin intended to make it easier to author (La)Tex files. Often, this is better served by using a standalone snippets plugin (like snipMate) to define the snippets you actually find useful as well as using the command ':compiler tex' to allow using Vim's quickfix feature when compiling TeX to an output format.
21:30  DHulme: use autocompletion
21:30  squ: ezzieyguywuf, who recommended it?
21:30  squ: it is not recommended if you are not english writer
21:30  krz: :Fuf <tab> returns nothing
21:30  ezzieyguywuf: squ: I'm saying it was recommended I _stop_ using it.
21:30  squ: because it uses alt keymappings
21:31  ezzieyguywuf: snipMate is, friggin, awesome though
21:31  squ: what is it?
21:31  ezzieyguywuf: uh, h/o the :h has a nice description of it
21:31  ezzieyguywuf: or wait
21:31  DHulme: vimgor: snipmate
21:31  vimgor: Rumor has it snipmate is snipMate.vim aims to be an unobtrusive, concise vim script that implements some of TextMate's snippets features in Vim. See http://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim for more info, DHulme
21:31  ezzieyguywuf: vimgore snipmate
21:31  ezzieyguywuf: ah you beat me!
21:32  DHulme: also I spelt vimgor's name correctly
21:32  ezzieyguywuf: lol.
21:32  Scala: snipmate is pretty awesome
21:32  krz: squ: ok, so how would i start it?
21:32  ezzieyguywuf: I'm glad I mispelt it.
21:32  krz: DHulme: \b does nothing
21:33  ezzieyguywuf: you guys ever used wmii? it works great when editing in vim, as you can move between X windows easily using vim-type keybindings
21:33  krz: so does \t
21:34  DHulme: krz: yes, I was suggesting you map those keys to the commands I mentioned in your .vimrc
21:34  Spidey01: Scala: I've heard good things about your namesake, and at least, it must beet the hell out of traditional Java
21:34  krz: oh
21:34  Scala: Spidey01: Yeah
21:36  krz: DHulme: do i have to restart vim to get the changes going?
21:37  DHulme: yes
21:37  squ: ezzieyguywuf, wmii is great
21:37  krz: vim .vimrc, i get Error detected while processing /Users/Chris/.vim/bundle/fuzzyfinder/plugin/fuf.vim:
21:38  krz: line   13: ***** L9 library must be installed! *****
21:38  krz: what does that mean?

21:42  krz: i type \b. nothing happens
21:42  squ: type again
21:43  DHulme: krz: you need to install the L9 library
21:43  krz: did already
21:43 --- Channel #vim was synced in 85 seconds
21:43  DHulme: did you restart Vim?
21:43  krz: yeap
21:43  DHulme: so what happens now if you type :Fuf<tab>
21:43  krz: \be works for bufexplorer
21:44  krz: DHulme: yea now i see it
21:44  krz: with :Fuf tab
21:44  krz: but why doesnt my mapping work
21:45  peth: krz: what does :set tm? ttm? say?
21:45  ThiefMaster: it says "trigger my irc client's highlight"
21:45  ThiefMaster: :p
21:45  DHulme: peth: given that \be works that seems unlikely to be the problem
21:46  peth: :D sorries :)
21:46  krz: it says timeoutlen=1000
21:46  DHulme: krz: did you restart Vim after putting that command in your .vimrc?
21:46  krz: eyap
21:46  peth: oh right, sorry got it the other way around.
21:46  DHulme: and could you paste the exact command?
21:46  krz: map \b for :FufBuffer<CR>
21:46  DHulme: the "for " is wrong
21:46  DHulme: see :help :map
21:47  krz: i put it on the last line in .vimrc
21:47  DHulme: and you probably want to make it nmap instead of map, otherwise it will confuse you when you try to insert \b into a file
21:47  krz: ok got it
21:52  krz: is it possible to allow fuzzyfinder to search from a specific dir directly?
21:55  squ: what does it search for
21:55  squ: you may use 'find' command
21:55  squ: or :vimgrep
21:58  consumerism: i'm using vim in gnome-terminal and gnome-terminal is capturing F1 instead of vim, anyone know how i can change that?
21:59  strull_: consumerism: you cannot do anything against it from within vim
21:59  squ: but you can run gvim
21:59  strull_: or xterm
22:00  consumerism: squ: i used to, but it was slow compared to vim in gnome-terminal. plus i never used the toolbar, seemed like a waste of time and space.
22:00  DHulme: vimgor: gnome-terminal
22:00  vimgor: A terminal that falsely claims to be xterm and gives users no way to change that without recompiling. If you're trying to get Vim to display more colors in gnome-terminal, make sure you have a gnome-256color terminfo entry ('tput -Tgnome-256color colors' says 256) and use the following snippet in your shell init file: http://vim.pastey.net/116135
22:00  squ: consumerism, :set guioptions=
22:00  squ: but may also check at #gnome channel
22:00  squ: what would they recommend
22:01  squ: also, if you like pressing F1, consider using K
22:04  krz: i mean i want fuzzyfinder to search from a specific dir. not from ~
22:05  Raimondi: krz: I don't use fuzzyfinder, but have you tried changing the cwd with :cd ?
22:05  krz: oh i thought that was only for nerdtree
22:09  krz: mksession saves a session. how do i load a session?
22:09  gkatsev: source the file
22:11  krz: im pretty sure i saved Nerdtree in my session
22:11  krz: mksession doesnt save this?
22:12  DHulme: krz: not all plugins play nicely with sessions
22:12  DHulme: krz: you could have found out how to load a session by reading :h :mksession
22:12  homekevin: For example, my sessionkiller.vim plugin really hates sessions.
22:12  DHulme: krz: don't be a vimpire
22:13  krz: ok :-)
22:15  squ: krz, your problem is amazingly small
22:15  krz: yes i know. i have bigger problems
22:16  squ: first of all you need to think that tonight is a night with stars falling at 100 per hour rate
22:16  krz: are you serious?
22:16  squ: which must give you clue of how small our planet is
22:16  squ: yes very rare event
22:16  krz: whats tonight?
22:16  squ: once per 20 years
22:17  krz: damn im in the wrong side of the world
22:17  krz: its 5am here
22:17  squ: then you must see it
22:17  squ: oh no
22:17  squ: it not yet started
22:17  krz: sun will probably be out by then
22:18  squ: let me continue
22:18  squ: after you realize how much percentage of space our planet takes
22:18  squ: in whole space
22:18  squ: you must realize how small is your vim problem
22:18  squ: which is not problem
22:18  walt: is anyone here using vim in xfce4-terminal?
22:18  krz: indeed
22:19 --- rivoot is now known as rivoot_away
22:19  walt: I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it to send the Alt key correctly to vim
22:19  squ: walt, it produce characters?
22:20  walt: squ: no, it doesnt trigger my bindings
22:20  walt: I can get it to work in urxvt and normal xterm
22:20  squ: there is #xfce channel
22:20  walt: I need eightBitInput set to true, but I can't find how to do it
22:20  walt: urxvt has the switch --meta8 that does it
22:21  squ: why would you use urxvt
22:21  squ: modern xterm can be compiled with unicode support
22:21  squ: which I use
22:21  squ: and use alt there too
22:22  squ: krz, where do you live?
22:22  krz: right now based n the philippines
22:22  SandCube: how to get adequate hightlight for editing .vimrc?
22:23  squ: krz, wait I tell about event:)
22:23  krz: whats the name of the event?
22:23  squ: SandCube, switch colorschemes with :colorscheme CTRL+D
22:23  walt: squ: I wanted to use it because it was faster. But I could not get 256 color support and the font rendering was messed up, so I went back to my default xfce4-term. the only problem is the alt key in vim
22:23  krz: if i cant get sessions to work with nerdtree. then i may just have to go back to my IDE istead
22:24  squ: no
22:24  evanton: If I have many open tabs, how can I avoid typing :wq for each of them to save everything and quit vim? Is there a single command that does everything?
22:24  squ: krz, the event will be at daylight:)
22:25  squ: evanton, hold Z
22:25  evanton: squ: the idea is that ZZ is the same as :wq or :x?
22:26  evanton: how to avoid overholding Z then?
22:26  DHulme: evanton: yes, :wqa (a for all); it's in the help about a page below :wq
22:26  evanton: DHulme: thanks, that will do and is easy to remember

22:37  krz: where are you based?
22:37  squ: europe
22:38  krz: i think im going back to my IDE
22:38  krz: gvim/macvim should come in a package
22:38  krz: too many custom shortcuts with new plugins
22:38  krz: and outdated once as well
22:38  krz: some work, and some dont
22:39  squ: you dont need plugins
22:39  squ: it have builtin functionality which people learn by years
22:40  DHulme: squ is right; you don't need plugins, just vimtutor
22:40  krz: my ide has several tabs opened. and 3 vertical views. it also has sessions
22:41  krz: its messy. but everything is there when i reopen it
22:41  krz: i have to remember, that vim is not an IDE
22:41  krz: its an editor
22:42  squ: you can use tabs in vim
22:42  squ: and save session
22:42  squ: and reopen it with vim -S
22:42  DHulme: indeed, it's an editor, so it can be way more efficient at having several files, some on the screen at the same time, and getting back your state after a restart
22:42  krz: i need basic plugins like nerdtree, snipmate, buffexplorer, sessions, etc for productivity
22:42  DHulme: but not if you try to make it behave exactly like your IDE
22:43  krz: those are all quite basic stuff
22:43  krz: but they dont seem to work well together
22:43  DHulme: they're all things for trying to make believe that Vim is an IDE
22:43  krz: textmate on the other hand is a different story
22:43  squ: buffexplorer is :ls command
22:44  squ: session is vim -S
22:44  squ: snipmate and nerdtree I dont know what it is
22:44  squ: but vim show directory tree with :E
22:44  DHulme: krz: put it this way: I've never used any of the plugins you mention
22:44  krz: i wish they can make a modern version of vim. something that comes in a package and more UI
22:45  squ: DHulme, me too
22:45  DHulme: krz: If you want something exactly like TextMate, or exactly like your IDE, you know where to find it.
22:45  squ: krz, this is definetely not going to happen
22:45  zematynnad: krz: what do you mean it's not in a package?
22:46  krz: what do you guys code?
22:46  DHulme: krz: But I guess you came to Vim for a reason, and if that reason is that you've heard it can be faster to do things a different way, then that's great. But you do actually have to do things a different way to get the benefit.
22:46  DHulme: krz: I've written C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, and PHP with Vim.
22:46  DHulme: oh, and Java
22:46  DHulme: some years ago
22:46  squ: he came to vim to eat our nerves
22:47  rson: krz: maybe you would enjoy eclim?
22:47  unkanon: krz: I switched *from* IDEs to vim and I love it
22:47  krz: yea heard of eclim
22:47 * zematynnad also switched from IDEs to vim
22:47  squ: visual studio is modern editor
22:47  squ: it even has built in compiler
22:47  krz: i cant stand havng one or two buffers opened and browsing through a directory tree to locate a file
22:47  DHulme: me neither
22:47  DHulme: so I don't do that
22:48  DHulme: I jump straight to where I want to go using ctags support
22:48  krz: but thats what nerdtree and fuzzy finder are there for
22:48  krz: and they dont exactly work
22:48  DHulme: so don't use them
22:48  DHulme: I use fuzzyfinder, but not for that
22:48  DHulme: browsing for files is the IDE way
22:48  DHulme: it's way too slow
22:49  krz: in vim. i cant type open . and navigate to the right dir and locate file everytime. takes too long
22:49  unkanon: DHulme: I have nerdtree installed but I rarely use it...
22:49  DHulme: krz: so don't do that
22:49  squ: you can browse file
22:49  unkanon: DHulme: so I have to learn the vim way
22:49  squ: :browse open/save command
22:49  krz: DHulme then what do you suggest?
22:49  DHulme: using ctags support
22:50  squ: I dont find telling him anything to be productive time waste
22:50  DHulme: or if you already know the filename, use :e and have it tab-complete the path for you
22:50  Kiruwa: krz: ctags... there's really no reason to pretend your editor should be a file manager
22:50  DHulme: :e foo<tab>bar<tab>baz<tab><CR>
22:50  unkanon: so ctags is for managing files?
22:50  squ: someone managed to use ctags and winapi?
22:50  rson: krz: you can use :find **/filename too
22:50 * Kiruwa gets by with 2 plugins... taglist and a.vim
22:51  DHulme: unkanon: it's for jumping to the definitions of things
22:51  unkanon: yeah I use :e a lot
22:51 * squ use 1 plugin. c.vim
22:51  DHulme: like functions and structs
22:51  unkanon: DHulme: oh ok
22:51  unkanon: even if they're on another file I suppose
22:51  DHulme: unkanon: regardless fo what file they're in
22:51  Kiruwa: squ: c.vim?
22:51  unkanon: gotcha
22:51  unkanon: DHulme: gotcha
22:51  squ: c-support its name
22:51  Kiruwa: ahh... the builtin stuff is fine for me
22:51  Kiruwa: what does it give you?
22:52  krz: ill look into ctags
22:52  squ: Kiruwa, heh actually I have rewriten most of it
22:52  krz: DHulme: http://amix.dk/blog/post/19329 ?
22:52  DHulme: krz: seriously, if you haven't yet, run vimtutor and it'll get you started
22:52  DHulme: krz: and stop looking for plugins
22:52  squ: I use F9 to compile
22:52  DHulme: krz: :help ctags
22:52  consumerism: if i'm in insert mode and i hit ctrl-u by accident, can i put back the contents of the line somehow?
22:53  consumerism: still in insert mode
22:53  DHulme: consumerism: you can leave insert mode and hit u to undo, but that'll undo everything you did in insert mode
22:53  squ: consumerism, try ctrl+r "
22:53  DHulme: squ: no, that doesn't work
22:53  DHulme: ctrl-u doesn't put in a register
22:54  squ: also :help register may have clue what register hold what

22:56  fow: consumerism, the <c-g>u creates a new undo block, so you can indeed leave insert mode and press u to undo just the <c-u> and press u again to undo the entire insert
22:56  rson: krz: think of tags as a map of your source tree.  you can select a function and the tags will take you directly to that place in your source tree.
22:56  fow: DHulme, yeah, I can see myself being glad consumerism triggered the thought in my head :)
22:57 --- Channel #vim was synced in 78 seconds
22:57  krz: rson: yea im looking in google. hopefully a more detailed-friendly tutorial may suffice
22:58  squ: krz, you are searching google for vim :help?
22:58  DHulme: sometimes I despair
22:58  consumerism: fow: interesting, thanks
22:58  fow: you're welcome
22:58  squ: fow, Ill use that too thanks! :)
22:58  DHulme: IDE users are so used to having no documentation or built-in features that their first instinct for everything is "is there a plugin for ..." or "is there a blog where I can learn about ..."
22:58  rson: krz: 10000 ft view: run ctags in your source tree to generate a tags file. tell vim about your tags file. use <C-]> with your cursor on a tag to jump to that tag, use <C-t> to jump back.
22:59  DHulme: rson: have you considered pasting the whole contents of :help 29.1 here?
22:59  fow: you're welcome, squ :)
22:59  rson: DHulme: i've not ever looked at that help page.
22:59  DHulme: rson: It would be marginally less silly than rewriting it here from scratch.
23:00  DHulme: It's a tutorial introduction to tags, in the user guide.
23:00  squ: fow, but what about buffers where all goes?
23:00  squ: oops s/buffers/register
23:00  rson: DHulme: that's nice..
23:00  fow: squ, hm?
23:00  krz: cmon even :help 29.1 is not even close to user-friendly
23:00  DHulme: squ: as I said, ctrl-u doesn't put the text into a buffer
23:00  squ: thats stupid
23:00  squ: :)
23:00  krz: ive read docs before. vim is not exactly the best doc out there
23:01  squ: krz, :)
23:01  DHulme: krz: Have you run vimtutor yet?
23:01  krz: *does not exactly have*
23:01  fow: krz, really? Vim's always been one of the best docs I've seen :P
23:01  krz: yea 2 years ago
23:01  DHulme: maybe it's time to refresh your memory
23:01  squ: vimfiles are better than manual pages
23:02  squ: almost the same funcionality as html files
23:02  ezzieyguywuf: how can a make a / case-sensitive?
23:02  squ: ezzieyguywuf, set noignorecase
23:02  ezzieyguywuf: squ: thanks
23:02  dindinx: ezzieyguywuf: or /\c
23:02  fow: ezzieyguywuf, \C
23:02  dindinx: \C, right
23:02  squ: \c ? :)
23:03  fow: squ, that makes it case insensitive
23:03  squ: its not working? :)
23:03  DHulme: squ: inside the pattern
23:03  DHulme: see :h /\c
23:03  krz: http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/
23:03  krz: "Here’s the thing, though: I didn’t really have to put up with a huge amount of pain when switching to Textmate for the first time. In fact, it was downright pleasant."
23:04  DHulme: krz: You know what, you're right.
23:04  fow: krz, I think you'd have a hard time finding an honest Vim user who disagrees with that
23:04  DHulme: We all just pretend to help people for a laugh.
23:04  squ: DHulme, you mean I am right that we dont need such user?
23:04  DHulme: krz: Everyone in this channel hates using Vim.
23:04  DHulme: krz: And you should stay with your existing IDE.
23:05  squ: /\C is not working
23:05  fow: krz, but it got really pleasant as experience grew
23:05  DHulme: why would you ever want to change? as you said, your IDE has all the features you need
23:05  squ: krz, you wasted 5 hours of our and your time
23:05  squ: in this channel asking various questions
23:05  squ: for no reason
23:05  squ: :)
23:05  krz: i share the same feeling as that dev. nothing wrong with vim. but its not exactly something that works pleasantly
23:06  krz: out of the box, at least
23:06  unkanon: krz: give it time
23:06  squ: :)
23:06  unkanon: it's worth it
23:06  squ: vim works out of the box.
23:06  krz: im going through vimtutor. waiting for ctags. this better be worth it
23:06  synfinatic: is there a way to jump to the next match without ever wrapping to the top of the file?
23:06  squ: synfinatic, n ?
23:07  unkanon: squ: he doesnt want to wrap to the top
23:07  squ: N ?
23:07  synfinatic: yeah, n wraps
23:07  unkanon: he wants the final find to yield an error
23:07  fow: synfinatic, :se nows
23:07  synfinatic: backwards
23:07  dindinx: This chan isn't there to make people switch to vim. It is there to allow people to answer questions about vim.
23:08  DHulme: synfinatic: It might be easier to help if you tell us what the end goal is, and why you don't want it to wrap.
23:08  krz: most of the people commenting in his blog are suggesting plugins. isnt this ironic?
23:08  squ: they are noobs
23:08  synfinatic: fow: thanks
23:08  squ: all bloggers are stupid noobs
23:09 * squ doesnt do blogs, doesnt use plugins
23:09  synfinatic: DHulme: need to go through a file and in certain cases make 2->1 and 1->2
23:09  unkanon: squ: easy
23:09  synfinatic: if i wrap, well I start undoing what I'm doing
23:09  dindinx: krz: vim has a great plug-ins system. What is the problem about finding a plug-in useful and telling about it?
23:09  squ: guys, I dont understand... /\C does not work
23:09  synfinatic: :set nowrapscan ftw
23:10  krz: dindinx: nerdtree does not work with sessions
23:10  DHulme: synfinatic: well, I'd probably use :s with the /c flag in that case
23:10  squ: if I type /Syntax ... with capital 'S' it match 'syntax' . if I type /\C . what must happen?
23:10  dindinx: krz: why should I care?
23:10  ezzieyguywuf: is there a #vim list of must-have plugins?
23:10  ezzieyguywuf: vimgor must-have plugins
23:10  vimgor: No idea!
23:10  DHulme: squ: if you just type /\C it won't do anything useful
23:10  DHulme: squ: you need /\CSyntax
23:10  squ: ah
23:10  dindinx: krz: and does this make nerdtree absolutely useless for anyone?
23:11  squ: DHulme, thanks :)
23:11  squ: krz, have you tried emacs?
23:11  synfinatic: DHulme: can't find help on //c or /c under /
23:11  DHulme: dindinx: Don't let yourself get dragged in. krz has already decided he's happy without Vim.
23:11  squ: krz, give emacs a try!
23:11  krz: no but i dont see how this can lead to more productivity, without a file tree navigator. i.e. having to manually browse through dirs and locating files using open .
23:11  squ: its also cool and its not vim
23:12  squ: exactly your case
23:12  DHulme: synfinatic: :h :s_c
23:12  dindinx: DHulme: then he shouldn't use it at all.
23:12  DHulme: dindinx: Agreed.
23:12  ezzieyguywuf: I've only been using vim since about mid-summer of this year. But I can no longer stand editing any sort of text without the option of getting out of insert-mode.
23:12  dindinx: DHulme: I won't feed that troll anymore. Sorry about my remarks.
23:12  squ: krz, you still have to learn a lot of things, kid
