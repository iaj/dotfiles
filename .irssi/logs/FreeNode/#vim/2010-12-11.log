00:52  b6: ormaaj: i don't think it's buggy. it's just not what you expected. make some space before you paste.
00:53 --- Channel #vim was synced in 73 seconds
00:55  ormaaj: ah yes, looks correct if I create the same number of new lines as lines yanked before pasting
00:56  b6: yeah, blocks are different.
00:57 * ormaaj is reformatting the massive tagsoup of <span> created by :TOhtml
00:58  b6: in most files i edit, i want to highlight tabs. but if ft={make,help,etc} i don't want to highlight tabs. what is a good way?
00:59  ormaaj: I just do modelines for such exceptions... there's probably a better way though.
01:00  Raimondi: au filetype make,help,etc so_stuff_here
01:00  b6: Raimondi: confused about whether to put that in after/ftplugin or what.
01:02  Raimondi: b6: I'd put it on my vimrc
01:05 --- Silex is now known as silex
01:10  harleypig: I'm trying to write a macro that uses a visually selected region.  i have a line of text  blah blah blah <useful info>  I want to place useful info at the beginning of each line.  But <useful info> is not the same for each line.  I've got a regex :%s/^\(.*\)\s\(<useful info\)/\1: \2/
01:10  harleypig: But I've got several hundred lines.
01:10  harleypig: If I can just visually select the <useful info> and press @q (or whatever) that would save me a lot of time.
01:13  b6: harleypig: well, i just did an experiment. i started recording and used commands like f" then ^V then f" to visually select some stuff in quotes. then i yanked it and went to the beginning of the line and pasted it. then i went down one line.
01:13  b6: you could stop the macro there and then do @m or whatever and then @@ a lot.
01:13  b6: seems like it would work.
01:13  harleypig: <useful info> isn't the same for every line. ... oh, I think I see.  I'll see what I get.
01:14  b6: harleypig: yeah, there have to be rules, like it's between <>s or ""s or something.
01:14  harleypig: well, excep I can't move use f" or whatver
01:14  b6: why?
01:14  harleypig: The text is very free form.
01:15  b6: i guess i don't get how you expect a computer to be able to do it if it requires real intelligence or something.
01:15  harleypig: It's just a list of titles and authors with no distinguishing separators.
01:15  b6: well, maybe you have to do 5w or something?
01:15  harleypig: ? I don't.  I want to select the text and then run a macro that includes the selected text.
01:16  b6: if you yank some text, the macro could use it just like you could.
01:16  b6: like with p or P.
01:17  harleypig: hmmm ... I think I know what I can do then.  Just position the cursor at the starting position, y to eol, substitute.  dunno why I didn't think of that. *sigh*
01:21  harleypig: Ok, so I've got "cy$ to yank <useful info> into register c, but how do I put it into :%s/^\(.*\)\s\(???\)/\2: \1/ ? ... "cp doesn't work where the ?'s are.
01:21  fadein: how can I tell if the function I'm in is running as an autocmd?
01:24  b6: harleypig: i think you want ^R then c
01:25  Raimondi: fadein: You can usea variable to keep track of that
01:27 --- robacarp_ is now known as robacarp
01:29  ormaaj: heh that was a lucky guess... I've never tried $ followed by \n to delete the linebreak in a regex but I guess that works.
01:29  harleypig: oh, ffs ... what the digraph for enter? I can't remember.
01:30  b6: ^M?
01:30  spiiph: Digraph for enter?
01:30  harleypig: When I record something and paste it I get <0d> which doesn work.
01:30  Raimondi: ormaaj: You don't need the $ to match a \n
01:30  cirwin: I have a custom makeprg set, but for some reason vim seems to cd before running it â€” can I work out what's causing that behaviour and stop it?
01:30  harleypig: I'm not think straight. The text to include in the macro so the enter key will be pressed.
01:31  b6: maybe ctrl-v followed by enter. dunno.
01:31  b6: cirwin: where is it cd'ing to?
01:32  cirwin: the directory containing the file in the current buffer
01:32  cirwin: ahh, I've got it
01:33  cirwin: some plugin has registered a cd on QuickFixCmdPre
01:35  ormaaj: Raimondi: I guess what surprised me was that it's legal to stick anything after the $. Since I was deleting entire lines (in some CSS) I could have just as well omitted it in s/^\s*background.*$\n//
01:36  strull_: ormaaj: the vim-way for this is :g/background/d
01:37  strull_: rsp.  :g/^\s*background/d
01:38  ormaaj: strull_: Oh cool... I didn't know you could use normal-mode motions as commands with :g
01:39  strull_: ormaaj: it's not a normal-mode motion.
01:39  strull_: It's an ex-command
01:40  ormaaj: strull_: actually it would probably be :g/^\s*background/dd
01:40  strull_: no
01:41  Raimondi: ormaaj: :h :d  and  :h d
01:41  harleypig: Is there a way I can search for, and move to, the first line that does not have a : in it?
01:42  ws: btw, you still can use them with :he normal
01:42  ormaaj: ah I was reading :h d
01:42  b6: harleypig: maybe something like /^[^:]*$
01:43  harleypig: b6: thanks, that's done it
01:52  ormaaj: Is the most complicated thing you can ever do in a single line of ex mode to execute a single function? (whatever follows the :) or is there some function composition operator for combining things
01:53  ormaaj: like :g I guess is a simple higher-order function
01:53  Raimondi: ormaaj: Not sure I follow you, but you can separate multiple ex comands with |
01:54  Raimondi: ormaaj: Just keep in mind that not all ex comands can be used that way.

02:15  qfr: How do I jump to the first non white space character in my code?
02:15  qfr: In the current line
02:15  strull_: ^
02:15  b6: maybe _ too.
02:15  qfr: Thanks
02:16  ormaaj: :g must modiify the cmd part of it's argument to not take a range itself (not that you'd ever want to do this)
02:17  ormaaj: and g can't take another g ^^
02:17  ormaaj: oh well

03:03  homekevin: *wants to answer
03:04  iaj: i just want to ask if someone got a nifty statusbar for it :-)
03:12  iaj: and how could I (when foldlevel is set to 0 through a line in the file) avoid that when switching buffers everything gets folded
03:19  qfr: How can I reset the C-n cache somehow? It's showing 500000 entries from a dictionary file I was performing searches in a few minutes ago, it's super annoyin

03:35 --- Remear_ is now known as Remear|mbp
03:45  lamdk: is there a way to start vim as if it didnt have +folding ?
03:45  lamdk: or any of the features you see when you type :version
03:48  deryni: You can probably force compatible mode to be on, that might do what you want. Depending on what you want exactly.
03:48  gkatsev: there's also vim-tiny and stuff.
03:51  corecode: hi
03:51  corecode: is there a way to change <Leader> for a specific plugin?
03:51  corecode: i.e. before the plugin gets executed
03:53  gkatsev: you can only have one mapleader at a time.
03:55  corecode: Note that the value of "mapleader" is used at the moment the mapping is
03:55  corecode: defined.  Changing "mapleader" after that has no effect for already defined
03:55  corecode: mappings.
03:55  corecode: it says
03:55  iaj: hmm how would you guys solve this: sometimes Im at the end of a word and want to add a comment afterwards - however if I tab (i use supertab = it tries completion) I can't tab over several tabs and add a "comment here there (in .vimrc for example) however when I then try to solve that by hitting C-V <TAB> a normal tab character gets inserted - I've got to <space> before I <tab> in this case, correct?
03:55  corecode: that means if i can change the mapleader for one plugin, i'd be fine
03:56  corecode: that seems exactly like why i didn't install supertab
04:01  iaj: what shiftwidth setting do you guys use?
04:03  corecode: depends on the code
04:03  corecode: 8 for C, of course
04:03  corecode: 2 for ruby
04:04  iaj: and in general?  :-)
04:04  corecode: 8
04:04  corecode: default
04:04  qfr: 4 for everything
04:04  iaj: even in your vimrc?
04:04  qfr: Including C and Ruby
04:04  qfr: And \t instead of spaces of course
04:04  qfr: Even in Haskell!
04:04  corecode: your \t is 4?
04:04  corecode: or 8
04:04  qfr: 4
04:04  corecode: uah
04:05  corecode: iaj: what do you mean
04:06  iaj: general count of shiftwidth if not ruby or C
04:06  iaj: i think I like 4 the most as well
04:09  iaj: can I prevent buffer switchingm:fdm=expr:fdl=0 
04:10  iaj: agh... sorry.."" vim:fdm=expr:fdl=0   got that in my vimrc... however.. now when I load the file up its all folded (as it should be!) but when I edit multiple buffers.. how can I have it remember its foldpositioin?
04:10  frogonwheels: iaj: I think that's in viminfo..
04:10  iaj: frogonwheels: huh?
04:12  frogonwheels: iaj:  hmm.. maybe not (:help 'viminfo)   you might need to make a view  :help :mkview  and restore it when you read the buffer
04:16  deryni: Why are you setting fdl in a modeline?
04:16  iaj: dunno why not :)
04:17  iaj: oh I guess I could just make an autocommand for when .vimrc gets edited
04:17  iaj: what is the event for when I load up a file into a buffer?
04:18  deryni: I'm not sure I understand why you are setting it then at all. Do you have some non-zero value set globally in your vimrc or something?
04:20  iaj: deryni: nah I don't its set to 99 basically
04:20  iaj: when I fire up vim
04:22  deryni: fdl defaults to 0 according to the docs, so something is setting it.
04:22  iaj: frogonwheels: thanks the mkview,  loadview solution is great :)
04:23  iaj: set foldlevelstart=99           " All folds open by default
04:23  iaj: ops ;\
04:24  qfr: I am using gvim. Is there a convenient way to like keep track of what files you had opened and when you close and relaunch the program, the same files are opened again?
04:25  qfr: Sometimes I work on combinations of 10-15 files and it's a lot of work to reopen them
04:25  iaj: qfr I guess you should take a look at :h mksession
04:28  qfr: Nice! Thanks
04:33  iaj: How would I find information about what C_U does in command mode?
04:34  deryni: :help c_ctrl-u ?
04:35  qfr: Can I specify a directory where session files are stord by default? I don't want them in my repository
04:37  qfr: I suppose I could write my own mksession and source functions for that hmm
04:37  qfr: Which append some string?
04:37  Tau: hey, where could i find a good tutor to extend vim by python ?
04:38  frogonwheels: Tau: :help :pydo   ?
04:38  frogonwheels: Tau: oh.. wrong .. um :help :python
04:39  Tau: frogonwheels, lol
04:39  Tau: frogonwheels, yeah. i think that is suitable.
04:40  frogonwheels: Tau: :hep python-vim   :)
04:42  Tau: frogonwheels, k
04:46  qfr: Will let test = "" be visible in functions even when it's defined outside?
04:46  qfr: Or does it need to be passed as an argument then?
04:48  qfr: I would like :blah to call my function s:Test, how do I do that?
04:48  Raimondi: qfr: From inside the function use g:test
04:48  qfr: Ok
04:49  qfr: or even :blah text
04:49  qfr: Such that text is passed as the first argument to s:Test
04:49  Raimondi: qfr: script functions can't be (easily) called from outside the script
04:50  qfr: Huh :o
04:50  Raimondi: You can create an ex command in the same script that calls said function
04:50  qfr: Well I'm putting it inside my .vimrc
04:51  qfr: My original goal was just to write something which turns :blah1 blah2 in normal mode to :mksession somevariable/blah2
04:51  qfr: I thought I would have to use a function for that
04:53  Tau: i have a doubt. i can't understand what python-range does.
04:53  Raimondi: qfr: ISn't there a way to ingore files with names matching a pattern in your repo?
04:53  qfr: Raimondi I want it to be the same everywhere >:O
04:53  qfr: Independent of the CWD
04:53  qfr: so I can be in / and go :loadsession project14
04:55  Raimondi: qfr: Something like this:  command! -nargs=1 -bar Mksession exec 'mksession something/'."<args>"
04:56  Raimondi: qfr: Actually this with a variable:  command! -nargs=1 -bar Mksession exec 'mksession '.somevariable."/<args>"
04:56  qfr: Nice, thanks
04:56  Raimondi: np
04:57  qfr: Raimondi what is the significance of '' vs. "" here?
04:57  iaj: Is there any way to search through the buffer but only the visible (eg. not the folded stuff)a
04:58  Tau: does someone know ?
04:58  Raimondi: I'm not sure, I started using '' but wasn't sure if <args> would be expanded inside them, so I switched. I think it should be expanded no matter what, but I'm not sure
04:58  Raimondi: qfr: ^
05:02  qfr: Hmm no luck so far
05:03  qfr: let sessiondirectory = "~/.vimswap"
05:03  qfr: command! -nargs=1 -bar SS exec 'mksession ' . sessiondirectory . "/<args>"
05:03  qfr: Doesn't print an error messag
05:03  qfr: but it didn't store anything in that directory either
05:03  qfr: Oh I am stupid
05:03  qfr: nevermind.
05:04  qfr: It works just fine, I just realised I used the wrong directory
05:04  Raimondi: Good :)
05:09  shiftingcontrol: autocmd FileType php set omnifunc=phpcomplete in .vimrc is enough for php auto completion
05:12  frogonwheels: shiftingcontrol: more like   set omnifunc=phpcomplete#CompletePHP
05:13  frogonwheels: shiftingcontrol: you will need to set up ctags too.. :help ftp-php-omni
05:13  shiftingcontrol: frogonwheels:what does #completePHP is it comment ?
05:13  frogonwheels: shiftingcontrol:  it's to do with the standard autoload stuff setup in vim.
05:14  frogonwheels: shiftingcontrol: so  phpcomplete#CompletePHP is the function name ..
05:14  shiftingcontrol: frogonwheels:ok finr,let me try and buzz back
05:15  frogonwheels: shiftingcontrol: and this means if the function doesn't exist, then load  :runtime  autoload/phpcomplete.vim     (the bit before the #) before trying the function again.
05:19  Tau: how can i access the buffer which holds the data set by 'v'(that command to select text).
05:19  Tau: from a python script ?
05:19  Tau: what is the buffer that i have to use from vim ?
05:19  shiftingcontrol: frogonwheels:thank yu it worked
05:21  Tau: ;~
05:26  gMinuses: Is it possible to auto hide vertical/horizontal scrollbar when nothing overflows?
05:32  UnclaimedBaggage: Hi folks - newbiesh question regarding autocomplete: Am I right in thinking ctrl-x ctrl-o should search through language-specific commands, *and* do a local search as per ctrl-n? At the moment when I hit ctrl-x ctrl-o it only occasionally comes up with local results, whereas ctrl-n consistently finds the local stuff I'm looking for. Have I misunderstood something or do I have a configuration error?
05:39  iaj: If i just do :mkview .. where is vim storing that file?
05:39  deryni: :help :mkview
05:40  Tau: does someone know how to access the data which is hold when you use 'v' to select text ?
05:46  Raimondi: Tau: YOu could yank it
05:47  Raimondi: Tau: and use gv to select it again if you need to.
05:47  Tau: Raimondi, hmm, yes, but i want to access it from a python porgram.
05:47  Tau: Raimondi, so, i want to access what the user has selected by v and get this buffer.
05:48  Raimondi: Tau: iirc, you can execute commands from python. So you can yank it to a register and use that register to handle the data
05:48  iaj: deryni: i tried to find it there but I couldn't :(
05:48  Tau: Raimondi, hmm, iirc ?
05:48  Tau: Raimondi, how so ?
05:49  iaj: deryni: nevermind
05:49  PhilB: UnclaimedBaggage: What language are you coding in?
05:49  Raimondi: I don't program with python, but I think you can execute vim commands
05:49  Tau: Raimondi, hmm, i guess i found a way.
05:49  Tau: let me try it
05:49  PhilB: Try :set omnifunc?  to see the current completion
05:50  UnclaimedBaggage: PhilB: Tried both ruby & html, same problem in both
05:50  shiftingcontrol: unclaimedBagge:autocmd FileType html set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags in .vimrc
05:52  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: Already there.
05:53  shiftingcontrol: unclaimedBagge:ctx +x o is not working ?
05:55  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: ctrl +x +o brings up language-related tags, but no local variables/methods. With that said, it does seem to *occasionally*...but it's sporadic...and I can't figure out why it doesn't 90% of the time. Ctrl +x p & Ctrl +x n both bring up the correct local autocompletes when tried on the same lines for which +x o returns no results.
05:55  Tau: Raimondi, no. what i tried didn't work.
05:55  Tau: Raimondi, what command would you use to get the that data ?
05:55  Tau: Raimondi, from the vim.
05:55  Raimondi: Tau: I'd yank it to a register
05:56  Tau: Raimondi, sorry, i'm new to vim. what would it be a register ?
05:56  shiftingcontrol: unclaimedbaggege:i worked for me for auto complete variables
05:57  Raimondi: Tau: Registers are like multiple clipboards
05:57  Raimondi: Tau: :h registers
05:58  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: Hmm, odd. I'm guessing a plugin is messing with it somehow. SnipMate is about the only thing I can imagine would cause trouble, and I'm guessing the problem would be very well documented if that was the cause
05:58  Tau: Raimondi, hmm
05:59  Raimondi: To yank the content into register a using VimL I'd use   normal "ay
05:59  Raimondi: Tau: ^
05:59  Tau: Raimondi, how can you access the registers ?
06:00  Raimondi: Prepend @ to its name, for register a  let var = @a
06:00  shiftingcontrol: unclaimedbaggege:you have autoload/snipMate.vim and autoload/omni/common and cpp etc ?
06:01  sio: Is there a way to jump to a character position in a line?  Like the 45th character postion in a line.  Not #<space>, or #l.
06:01  Tau: Raimondi, hmm i will try.
06:01  strull_: sio: try 45|
06:02  sio: strull_: thank you!
06:02  strull_: np, have fun!
06:03  Tau: Raimondi, how can i access a variable in vim script ? in that case let var =blabla then i want to retrieve var ?
06:03  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: Might have found the problem here. I have autoload/snipMate ...I wasn't even aware there was an an autoload/omni & cpp...just a default 7.3 install, omni isn't automatically included?
06:04  sio: Is there a way to jump to a specific line number and character position, in one command?
06:05  Raimondi: Tau: I'd say just use  var  , but the way to use it depends on what you're doing...
06:05  qfr: How do you delete a line without copying stuff into the " buffer, by the way?
06:05  shiftingcontrol: UnclaimedBagge:yes you need to install that ,http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1520
06:05  lofidellity: How do i execute a command on :w, BufWritePre doesnt seem to do it
06:05  qfr: register* sorry
06:05  Hunner: Hi. is there a default single-key version of gj/gk
06:05  Hunner: ?
06:06  Raimondi: Tau: I think you could use :h python-eval
06:06  Tau: Raimondi, yes.
06:06  strull_: qfr: :he quote_
06:07  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: Ahh - not a c++ project. I do have rubycomplete in autoload, however
06:07  Raimondi: To use one of those examples  :py str = vim.eval('val')
06:07  Raimondi: Tau: ^
06:08  shiftingcontrol: UnclaimedBaggage:i ve only c/cpp but php auto completion  works for me in php
06:08  UnclaimedBaggage: shiftingcontrol: I'll keep searching. Thanks anyway
06:09  shiftingcontrol: UnclaimedBaggae:just try this as an experiment then if ya get you are done,most welcome

06:15  fritzophrenic: no quote when using it in an expression

07:35  Error404NotFound: like bc-1.06-21 should become bc and bcel-5.1-8jpp.1 should become bcel
07:37  Raimondi: :s/-\d.*$//
07:37  Raimondi: Error404NotFound: ^
07:38  Error404NotFound: Raimondi, great, i was using php re :P ;)
07:47  paissad: guys, there is a hidden character in my bash source code ! \302\240
07:47  paissad: i see it at debugging
07:48  paissad: but set :set list does not show any special char !
07:48  paissad: any idea to avoid such a problem ?
07:52  paissad: i see it also when i do "od -c filename"
08:36  scorp007: if I have defined a syntax match <foo> ... in my vimrc file, how do I temporary disable such a command for a file I'm viewing?
08:37  Tau: hi.
08:37  scorp007: i.e. is there a way to 'unmatch' it temporarily?
08:38  Raimondi: Tau: wb
08:38  Tau: i have finished my little plugin. i would like to know whether there is something of plugin similar to that.
08:38  Tau: Raimondi, hey
08:38  homekevin: scorp007: I don't think so.
08:38  Tau: http://codepad.org/6QnsZeaa
08:38  homekevin: scorp007: syntax items can be deleted, but not disabled as far as I know.
08:38  scorp007: what does deleted mean?
08:38  homekevin: scorp007: The highlighting can be changed, though.
08:39  scorp007: deleted, as in, completely removed from the vimrc?
08:39  Tau: Raimondi, hey take a look on that. tell me what u find
08:39  scorp007: ah, perhaps the highlighting change is what I need
08:39  homekevin: scorp007: No, I mean you can make Vim "forget" it was defined.
08:39  Tau: idk whether there was something alike.
08:40  scorp007: homekevin, the situation is I've got a line like: au BufWinEnter * exec 'syntax match Todo /\%>' . &textwidth . 'v.\+/'  in my vimrc, and for some files, it's annoying to have that highlighting.
08:40  scorp007: i.e. in files I didn't write, such as autogenerated logs, etc.
08:41  scorp007: any tips on the best way to handle this?
08:42  Tau: hum
08:42  Tau: does someone know whether there is something alike
08:42  Tau: lol
08:43  Tau: i fear having done something which was useless
08:43  homekevin: scorp007: I don't have any simple answer, because I don't think there's a way to detect files that are annoying under particular circumstances.
08:43  Tau: ;~
08:43  homekevin: scorp007: But you could have a command to turn it on and off, for example.
08:43  scorp007: homekevin, I'm not asking for autodetection, but a simple way to temporarily toggle or disable the highlighting
08:43  scorp007: that's what I'm after.
08:44  Raimondi: Tau: I don't work with python, so I'm not the best source of knowledge about python plugins. If nobody else says nothing, consider sending an email to the vim_use list.
08:44  Tau: Raimondi, k
08:46  homekevin: scorp007: You might get some tips from my plugin that does something similar, but it's fairly complicated: https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/vim-scripts/blob/master/plugin/fmtwarn.vim
08:47  homekevin: Handling a bunch of different cases gracefully can be difficult in vimscript
08:47  scorp007: well, I don't need something elaborate, just a basic "disable this bit of highlighting"
08:47  scorp007: maybe bound to a hotkey...
08:48  homekevin: scorp007: BTW, I suggest matches instead of syntax. It's way easier.
08:48  scorp007: isn't that what I", doing? syn match ?
08:48  homekevin: I'm not sure there's a way to make syntax override "unknown" syntax in general.
08:48  homekevin: scorp007: :h :match
08:49  homekevin: scorp007: And more importantly, :h matchadd()
08:50  homekevin: syntax priority makes it really difficult to do something like this in a way that works with whatever random syntax might be in effect. Trust me, I tried it that way.
08:50  scorp007: is there a simple way to toggle the highlighting for say, 80 columns on and off using that?
08:50  homekevin: Actually, I think it's probably not "really difficult", so much as "impossible"
08:50  homekevin: scorp007: Using which "this"?
08:51  scorp007: :match
08:51  homekevin: scorp007: It uses the same pattern syntax :syn-match uses.
08:51  scorp007: match seems to only get in effect once though, rather than as I type...
08:51  scorp007: yeah, but how do I turn it off?
08:51  scorp007: interactively, that is.
08:51  homekevin: scorp007: And it's not directly toggle-able, but you can easily create a match and delete it.
08:51  scorp007: how?
08:51  homekevin: ...then create it again when you need it, etc.
08:52  scorp007: ..also for some reason, replacing syn-match with match stopped the highlighting from working...
08:52  homekevin: Well, highlighting is what :match does.
08:53  homekevin: If it didn't work, it's either a bug or PEBCAK
08:53  scorp007: I had a line: au BufWinEnter * syntax match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/  which I replaced with au BufWinEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/ and the highlight no longer works (for trailing spaces)
08:53  scorp007: after sourcing the vimrc file
08:54  scorp007: hmm, nevermind, exiting vim seemed to fix that.
08:55  homekevin: Yeah, it worked for me. But I'd recommend not relying on 'magic' being set a particular way.
08:55  scorp007: what do you mean?
08:56  scorp007: is there a way to list all active matches?
08:56  homekevin: scorp007: Did you check :h matchadd()?
08:57  scorp007: hmm
08:58  scorp007: :call getmatches() doesn't tell me anything?
08:58  homekevin: scorp007: No, it wouldn't. You are throwing away the result.
08:58  scorp007: oh.
08:58  homekevin: Try :echo
08:58  scorp007: ah
08:58  Edico: hi
08:59  homekevin: scorp007: I'm going to bed now. Everything you need to know about using match functions should be pretty easy to find in the help.
08:59  scorp007: ok, thanks.
09:00  Edico: I have some marks a, b , how do I paste them?
09:00  scorp007: anyone know why this line isn't working? au BufWinEnter * exec 'match Todo /\%>' . &textwidth . 'v.\+/'
09:00  scorp007: it supposed to presumably add a match to the getmatches() list?
09:00  scorp007: but it doesn't.
09:01  scorp007: whereas: this line: au BufWinEnter * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/ works.
09:03  Edico: I selected some marks with d'a, d'b, and  and now I want pastem both, how can be done that?
09:03 --- dive is now known as Guest28040
09:05  Raimondi: Edico: :h quote0
09:06  scorp007: omfg -- does the regular :match overwrite existing matches?
09:07  scorp007: that explains why only the last match was in effect...
09:10  Edico: Raimondi, that help doesn't help me at all
09:12  Edico: I've marked two pieces of text with ma a, d'a, ma b, d'b and now I want to paste them in some location
09:13  Edico: should be something like p'a, p'b
09:15  Raimondi: Edico: No, when delete text it goes to a register, it has nothing to do with marks anymore
09:15  Raimondi: s/when/when you/
09:17  Raimondi: Edico: So, if you deleted in the last two deletions, they're in the registers 0 and 1,  "0p  and "1p  would be what you need
09:28  Edico: thanks Raimondi
09:30  Edico: 'a is "2p and 'b is "0p but for the mark 'b the first line from the text did no pasted

12:56  seku: & is setting and cp short for compatible
12:57  seku: :echo &cp would print 1 or 0 depending on whether compatible is set. :set cp? is a better way of doing it

12:57  complete: Hey People! Is there a way to make vim not display the path to the file in tabs?
12:57  nate-: thanks
12:57  complete: I already have crazy tab titles like /x/y/y/g/s/g/some_file.php
12:58  complete: i dont wont to see the path
12:58  frogonwheels: complete: I think :help 'tabline
12:58  complete: frogonwheels: what is the ' for?
12:59  frogonwheels: complete:  the help topic is   :help 'tabline'     'tabli   would probably get it though
12:59  seku: setting are like 'setting' in help
12:59  complete: frogonwheels: hmm... "help tabline" seems to work
12:59  frogonwheels: complete: look at :help    (with no argument).. there's a little table
12:59  frogonwheels: complete:  try  :help tab   vs  :help 'tab
13:00  complete: tabline seems to be empty
13:00  complete: sure that its the place where my pathname comes from?
13:00  frogonwheels: complete: yes.. and so is falling back to the default.
13:01  frogonwheels: try :set tabline=%f
13:01  complete: let me try...
13:01  frogonwheels: hmm..
13:01  complete: hmm... now it takes the whole width of the screen
13:02  frogonwheels: err sorry  %t
13:02  complete: same result
13:02  complete: where do these parameters (%f, %t) come from?
13:02  frogonwheels: reading the :help
13:03  frogonwheels: ah crap. it's not for gui
13:03  complete: i AM reading it, but did not come across it yet
13:03  complete: gui? i dont have a gui.
13:03  complete: i use vim in the terminal.
13:03  complete: via ssh on another machine.
13:03  frogonwheels: oh ok. you know about ctrl+] to follow links in :help ?
13:04  complete: no
13:04  frogonwheels: read :help
13:04  complete: arghhh
13:04  frogonwheels: learning how to use the :help  is the best thing you can do.
13:05  complete: let me try google...
13:05  frogonwheels: complete:  ahh.. try think link to  :help setting-tabline
13:06  frogonwheels: complete: annoyingly you have to return the WHOLE tab line.
13:06  frogonwheels: complete: there are examples there.
13:07  complete: ???
13:07  frogonwheels: complete:  :help setting-tabline
13:08  complete: as far as i see the situation, there is no easy solution.
13:08  frogonwheels: complete: give us a few secs.
13:08  complete: ok
13:10  complete: normally i use one teminal per buffer. and then switch between buffers by switching terminals. which is very nice in gnomes terminal emulator. but no that i code on a remote computer, i dont have that.
13:10  frogonwheels: complete: you a) should use windows rather than tabs   and  b)  can always use screen
13:12  complete: windows?
13:12  frogonwheels: complete: :split
13:12  complete: then my screen gets smaller and smaller
13:12  frogonwheels: frogonwheels: or even just look at 'hidden
13:13  frogonwheels: complete: most people work that way.   just use  :buf <tab> to switch between active buffers
13:14  complete: yes, i know that. but i like to have a tab bar with the names of the files.
13:14  frogonwheels: complete: you need to understand the relationship between buffers (files in memory)  windows (viewports on a buffer)
13:14  frogonwheels: complete:  ok. hold a sec
13:14  frogonwheels: complete: was hoping I could do it with map() .. almost  but not with highlighting the correct tab.
13:15  complete: one other thing i miss when coding on a remote machine is that I cannot switch to tab #x by hitting ALT+#x
13:17  complete: Apart from that, I really like remote coding. I think I will move all our development servers to the cloud.
13:18  complete: its not slower then coding on the lan.
13:19  seku: you'd have to be a quick typist if it was :D
13:20  FernandoBasso: :D
13:20  ij: Is it possible to tempoarily make vim show all the lines, that match my regex? I want to _see_(!=delete) them, edit them, and then like go back.
13:21  complete: seku: well, it surely depends on the connection. at the moment im on dsl. no when everything is in the cloud i could run my company from everywhere in the world. but then im probably often on umts or even slower connections.
13:21  complete: ij: :%! grep your_expression
13:22  complete: ij: then hit CTRL+u to undo :)
13:22  FernandoBasso: The only thing is that you cannot expect to edit core remotely, and expect vim to have the same features as locally.
13:22  complete: ij: but there is surely a better way.
13:22  FernandoBasso: /core/code/
13:22  complete: FernandoBasso: what features should go away???
13:23  ij: complete, What happens, if I edit?
13:23  FernandoBasso: Tabs, for instance. Thy cannot behave in the same way as localy.
13:23  complete: ij: then you are fucked. i dont know if you can "hide lines that dont match a regex" and still edit the rest. never heard about that.
13:23  complete: FernandoBasso: why not?
13:24  ij: complete, That'd be a kick-ass feature. :/
13:24  complete: FernandoBasso: remember, im always using a terminal. loacal and remote. never used gvim.
13:24  complete: ij: what for?
13:25  ij: complete, Couple of similar CSS rules are around. I want to see them all, edit 'em. They're spread across all the file, because I didn't think at first. ;-D
13:26  FernandoBasso: complete: Why can't you switch to tab #x by hitting ALT+#x ?
13:26  complete: ij: why not jump from one to the next with the search function?
13:26  complete: FernandoBasso: ALT+#x is functionality of the terminal emulator. not of vim.
13:27  complete: FernandoBasso: locally, im using one terminal per buffer.
13:27  ij: complete, I cannot see them all at the same time.
13:27  FernandoBasso: complete: And why don't you use only one terminal, and many buffers in one terminal?
13:28  ij: One terminal in one terminal? ;-D
13:28  FernandoBasso: No.
13:28  complete: FernandoBasso: i dont get what you want to tell me. vim has the same features on the remote machine as on my local machine.
13:29  complete: FernandoBasso: ah, you mean locally? well, one reason is the fucked up tab titles in vim, when i do.
13:29  FernandoBasso: Oh. Okay.
13:29  complete: ij: then why not sort your css file so that the rules in question are in one place?
13:30  FernandoBasso: complete: Any way, using only one vim instance, and many buffers is generally recommended.
13:31  complete: FernandoBasso: another reason for my many vims is this: i can easily switch to another file in the same directory by doing ":q" and then "vim another_file.txt".
13:31  ij: complete, Because I'm lazy. That's why I use vim.
13:31  ij: complete, lern2 --remotetab
13:31  complete: ij: hmm... i never been a lazy person, so i cannot give advice for that situation.
13:32  DHulme: complete: that's easier than :e another_file.txt ?
13:32  FernandoBasso: complete: You are missing all the vim power.
13:32  ij: I second ^
13:33  complete: DHulme: yes, because i dont know the filename in my head. i normaly do "ls" and then "vim somefile"
13:33  complete: DHulme: ofcourse i can do :E
13:34  complete: DHulme: but then I have 2 buffers in one vim. and no tabs with nice titles.
13:34  FernandoBasso: complete: :!ls and :edit <tab> will also help you.
13:34  seku: but you could get a drop down with press of a key, which shows your buffers
13:34  complete: FernandoBasso: still no tabs
13:34  seku: or a file list which equals ls, and open a file by pressing enter
13:35  complete: seku: sure. but i like to have a tab bar.
13:35  FernandoBasso: complete: I also use tabs sometimes, but tabs are just one way to manage files/buffers. There are other ways.
13:36  complete: i need 2 things: 1) a tab bar with filenames without path. 2) an easy way to "open a filebrowser in the same directory as the file im currently editing".
13:36  complete: locally i do that with gnomes terminal manager.
13:36  complete: maybe i will try screen to do it remotely.
13:36  ij: Just mount the filesystem, if your connection is persistant.
13:36  complete: ij: i prefer to ssh right into it
13:37  complete: ij: but yes, thats another option
13:37  ij: That is faster, yeah. I read "gnome's file manager" instead of "gnomes terminal manager".
13:37  complete: ij: no, terminal manager.
13:37  ij: Also fsck anything gnome's. Use screen.
13:37  ij: It's really easy.
13:37  seku: i also prefer to do rpm -Uvh instead of clicking a package... because i always remember too late i can double click the package
13:37  complete: ij: i dont use anything but a terminal manager and firefox for development.
13:38  ij: complete, cd; wget http://sprunge.us/QNPi -O.screenrc
13:38  complete: ij: whats that?
13:38 --- scholtz is now known as QuiltPants
13:40 --- QuiltPants is now known as scholtz
13:40  ij: Screen's configuration file.
13:41  ij: Save it, then write `screen` and press C-r ?
13:42  complete: ij: yeah, using screen is an option.
13:42  complete: ij: but not today.
13:42  complete: ij: happily hacking away on my code today.
13:48  iaj: what's a good way to start to learn about setting the statusway a proper way with some examples?
13:52  DHulme: vimgor: statusline
13:52  vimgor: Check out scrooloose's blog entry for all your 'statusline' needs: http://got-ravings.blogspot.com/2008/08/vim-pr0n-making-statuslines-that-own.html
14:00  mountained: im trying to get vim started for editing java projects
14:00  mountained: and used this script http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_netbeans_4_and_vim_for_java
14:00  mountained: compiling works but running returns a NoClassDefFoundError error
14:01  nate-: godlygeek, you there?
14:02  peth: ij: try :set fdm=expr fde=getline(v:lnum)!~'pattern'
14:04  ij: peth, Cool!
14:05  ij: peth, Can you explain what does that getline thing do?
14:05  dangerboy: ha!
14:05  peth: getline fetches the line given as argument, in this case the line number the foldexpr operates on
14:06  peth: "!~" for "if not matching", so in english: fold by my expression; my expression is: if the line doesn't match pattern, fold
14:07  dangerboy: here goes. I'm very new to vim. I'd like to do the vimtutor but in Vim.app rather than the console. Is this possible? If so, how?
14:10  peth: dangerboy: you may have luck with gvimtutor or vimtutor -g
14:11  dangerboy: gvimtutor isn't found, and vimtutor -g opens in the console
14:11  peth: sorry then. not a mac man myself. that's what the help says for unixy systems
14:12  mountained: the script tries to run the file in the source dir
14:12  dangerboy: maybe it's somewhere in the Vim.app?
14:12  dangerboy: where is vimtutor normally located?
14:13  peth: dangerboy: i don't think it's possible to call vimtutor from within vim. the vimtutor bin should be right next to vim in the fs
14:13  mountained: http://pastebin.com/SNd1krAe this is the config
14:14  iaj: mountained: is that working?   do you also have completion in vim now?
14:14  dangerboy: could it be /Users/jamesbailey/Applications/Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/tutor/tutor
14:14  mountained: iaj, like i told the script doesnt run my java programms
14:16  iaj: mountained: ahh ok... id be interest if it works cos im using eclim
14:16  iaj: how can I get the content of an option like &stl when I'm in insert mode?
14:17  iaj: c-r=&stl ... oh.. my bad.. sorry
14:21  fow: dangerboy, see :h tutor, then scroll down. It'll tell you how to accomplish what vimtutor does (vimtutor is just a shell script)
14:21  dangerboy: yeah, I'm doing the "on other systems" now
14:23  dangerboy: okay, is there any way I can do the vim -u NONE -c "set nocp" TUTORCOPY from within vim?
14:26  peth: just :e path/to/TUTORCOPY
14:27  dangerboy: yay!
14:27  dangerboy: thank you
14:27  peth: ":set nocp" if it isn't already in the vimrc
14:27  peth: alright, have fun! :)
14:28  dangerboy: without quotes?
14:28  peth: yes
14:28  dangerboy: thank you
14:33  dangerboy: is there a tutor for the gui? like, how to use the mouse?
14:34  iaj: im using expandtab.. is there any way when I have comments on the left of a string or something - that the tabbing keeps the alignment?
14:38  dangerboy: so, in doing the tutor, when I type a number, is there anything that tells me what number I've typed and I'm just not seeing it?
14:38  abstract3d: vim keymap profile for netbeans?? (viex is the solution??)

14:40  abstract3d: please ignore previous, only keep that "15:38 < abstract3d> vim keymap profile for netbeans?? (viex is the solution??)"
14:42  peth: dangerboy: try :set showcmd
14:43  peth: that should display incomplete commands and counts in the bottom right corner
14:44  peth: oh
15:07  TheBrayn: abbr #2in #include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h> <- how can i make this work?
15:16  DHulme: TheBrayn: by reading :help abbreviations
15:16  ws: TheBrayn: "... Examples of strings that cannot be abbreviations: "a.b", "#def", "a b", "_$r"
15:16  ws: "
15:16  DHulme: pay particular attention to the three types of abbreviations
15:18  DHulme: and you probably want :iabbr instead of :abbr to make it only work in insert mode
15:34  iaj: I got a question when I for example type:  'hi vimMap'  i get a  xxx links to vimCommand
15:34  iaj: how can I actually get the color settings?
15:41  iaj: Another one: how could I write the output of a :hilight command to my current buffer?
15:41  iaj: I guess something with C-R= ... but what's following?
15:44  peth: iaj: vimMap is linked to vimCommand, so look at vimCommand (and so on) to find the effective group
15:44  peth: i'd use redir for the second question
15:53  iaj: thats pretty annoying... takes some time - no faster way?  or do you have a good mapping for it?
15:54  iaj: peth how can I have a highlight that's refering to an existing one?
15:54  iaj: like I wanna have a User defined color which is refering to the guibg of StatusLine
15:58  DHulme: iaj: :help hi-link
16:00  iaj: DHulme: that's linking a whole grouop... no? can't i have specific settings linked only :) ?
16:02  ws: hmm.. is the vim FAQ on vim.wikia.com the most recent one?
16:02  ws: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/vimfaq.html#3.1
16:02  ws: "The latest version of Vim is 6.2 released on 1st June 2003."
16:03  ws: sorry, not vim.wikia.com but on sf
16:09  DHulme: vimdoc on sf is maintained by someone else
16:09  DHulme: it's just a mirror of the help that comes with Vim
16:12  ws: ah
16:12  ws: thanks
16:13  merijn: I'm having issues with vim on a server, I'm used to using "set foldenable;set foldmethod=syntax" to fold functions. It's working fine on my desktop, but on this server I get "no fold found" for the exact same position in the source.
16:13  merijn: Any clues on how to find the problem?
16:13  ws: what does ":se filetype?" show on both?
16:15  merijn: filetype=c
16:15  merijn: For both files
16:19  ezzieyguywuf: how can I make / not case sensitive?
16:19  ezzieyguywuf: er, I'm sorry I want it to be case sensitive
16:19  ws: :he ic
16:19  fow: ezzieyguywuf, /\Cfoo
16:19  ezzieyguywuf: cool thanks
16:20  fow: you might also be interested in 'smartcase'
16:21  singlecore: hey dudes
16:21  merijn: smartcase rocks my world :D
16:21  singlecore: just installed 7.3 from source
16:21  singlecore: where can i get the gui for it?
16:21  singlecore: im usinng ubntu
16:22  singlecore: can i just apt-get vim-gnome ?
16:22  singlecore: the version in the ubuntu sources is 7.2 btw
16:22  davek: singlecore: not if you built 7.3 from source.  it sounds like you're missing necessary development packages to build the gui
16:23  singlecore: davek, just checked out from https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ thats all
16:24  davek: you could try 'apt-get build-dep vim-gtk' to get all of the necessary development libraries  (if not 'vim-gtk' then maybe it was vim-full?  working from memory on the package name here)
16:25  singlecore: davek, will gvim then be built by default or do i have to configure it before make
16:25  peth: singlecore: ./configure --help
16:26  davek: peth beat me to it, but yes, you'll have to re-run configure, and pay attention to the output.
16:27  peth: singlecore: you'll want something like --with-features=huge --enable-gui=gnome2 and a few others i guess
16:27  singlecore: kk thx ill look into it
16:41  fholgado: Morning guys, anyone aware of a way that I can get the previously focused buffer's name through bufname()?
16:44  fow: fholgado, bufname('#') should do it
16:44  fholgado: @fow, thanks so much!
16:45  fow: you're welcome
16:45  fholgado: first time modifying a plugin, coming along well so far...
16:51  fholgado: will be updating MiniBufExplpp soon with a feature that highlights the current buffer that you are focused on within the explorer
16:51  fholgado: makes minibufexpl actually usable when you have lots of splits and buffers open
17:22  dangerboy: quick question, how do I set the default color scheme in vim?
17:23  tangledhelix: colorscheme {whatever} e.g. "colorscheme zenburn" in .vimrc
17:23  tangledhelix: supposes you have the colorscheme in  ~/.vim/colors/
17:25  dangerboy: thanks, I'll try it
17:29  peth: dangerboy: did you find :set showcmd ?
17:29  dangerboy: no, I'm not there yet
17:29  dangerboy: I'm on lesson 6.2
17:30  peth: you asked about how to display the count (and incomplete commands) earlier but parted too soon. it's :set showcmd
17:30  dangerboy: count?
17:31  peth: <dangerboy> so, in doing the tutor, when I type a number, is there anything that tells me what number I've typed and I'm just not seeing it?
17:31  dangerboy: okay
17:31  dangerboy: count does that?
17:32  dangerboy: or :set showcmd
17:32  peth: i'm not sure we mean the same thing. i'm talking about the numbers you prepend to commands as in 3dd . yes, :set showcmd
17:32  dangerboy: okay
17:33  fow: dangerboy, the number you type is called a count in Vim-speak
17:39  dangerboy: well, the colorscheme didn't work
17:41  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: Do you have that colorscheme inside ~/.vim/colors/ ?
17:41  dangerboy: no
17:41  dangerboy: so where are the colorschemes
17:42  FernandoBasso: Some are in /usr/share/vim/vim73/colors/
17:42  FernandoBasso: The default ones.
17:42  dangerboy: okay
17:42  dangerboy: they're in ~/Applications/Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/colors
17:43  dangerboy: can I just append the path to the colorscheme?
17:43  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: How exactly did you set it in vimrc?
17:43  dangerboy: I put
17:43  FernandoBasso: (vim know about the default ones, or the ones inside ~/.vim/colors
17:43  dangerboy: colorscheme slate
17:43  dangerboy: in my ~/.vimrc
17:44  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: What happens if you do :colorscheme slate from a running instance of vim?
17:45  dangerboy: it changes
17:45  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: What happens if you :source /path/to/your/vimrc?
17:47  dangerboy: no obvious feedback
17:47  FernandoBasso: Did it change the colorscheme, at least?
17:47  dangerboy: no, it's still slate
17:47  FernandoBasso: Change to another, and try :source vimrc to see if it change to slate.
17:48  FernandoBasso: Moreover, do you have a proper named vimrc? Are you on windows?
17:48  dangerboy: I assume my .vimrc is named properly. I wouldn't know if it isn't. I'm not on windows. I'm on OSX.
17:49  dangerboy: sourcing the vimrc changes the colorscheme
17:49  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: Then, your vimrc is not being read at vim startup.
17:49  FernandoBasso: It is in the wrong path, perhaps.
17:49  dangerboy: it's at ~/.vimrc
17:49  FernandoBasso: Hmm. It is correct.
17:50  FernandoBasso: :help vimrc says in OS it can also be _virmc. Any way it does not make sense.
17:51  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: What if you do vim -u /path/to/.vimrc ?
17:52  FernandoBasso: I mean, does it start with the colorscheme you have specified?
17:53  dangerboy: oh sorry, I'm using the vim.app
17:53  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: So, can't you type that command?
17:53  dangerboy: no
17:53  FernandoBasso: Oh.
17:54  dangerboy: I click on the Vim.app to start it
17:54  FernandoBasso: But sure, your vimrc is not being read at startup for some reason.
17:55  FernandoBasso: I assume that since :source ~/.vimrc does load your specified colorscheme.
17:55  dangerboy: is there a way from within vim to set the default colorscheme?
17:56  FernandoBasso: No.
17:56  FernandoBasso: Only on vimrc.
17:56  FernandoBasso: (I don't think so.)
17:56  DHulme: dangerboy: if you start a fresh Vim session, does the output of :scriptnames include your .vimrc?
17:57  dangerboy: yes
17:57  dangerboy: it's the first line
17:57  DHulme: then it is being sourced
17:57  bosie: and you are sure you don't override colorscheme down the line?
17:57  dangerboy: there's no other instance of color or colorscheme in the .vimrc
17:58  bosie: DHulme: if i do ':scriptnames', how can i transfer the list to a buffer/new window?
17:58  dangerboy: unless there's something in the example .vimrc that might change it
17:59  FernandoBasso: http://code.google.com/p/macvim/issues/detail?id=204
18:00  DHulme: bosie: see :help :redir
18:00  bosie: dangerboy: well, i have a file called .gvimrc that sets colorscheme later
18:00  dangerboy: my .gvimrc is just a copy of my .vimrc
18:01  bosie: dangerboy: but you only changed .vimrc?
18:01  dangerboy: no, I changed both
18:01  bosie: DHulme: well
18:01  DHulme: there's no point having a .gvimrc identical to your .vimrc as GVim sources both
18:02  dangerboy: but what does Vim.app source?
18:02  DHulme: dangerboy: you don't set 'runtimepath' after the :colorscheme command, do you? it could be that Vim can't find the colorscheme when it reads the :colo in your .vimrc, but it can when you later do it after Vim has finished loading
18:03  DHulme: dangerboy: No idea. I don't use Mac.
18:03  dangerboy: it's set before
18:04  dangerboy: whatever, I'll get it fixed eventually
18:12  FernandoBasso: dangerboy: Well, try, instead of doing 'colorscheme slate' do source /path/to/slate
18:19  homekevin: sounds like dangerboy is doing something after setting the colorscheme that resets it.
18:20  homekevin: Maybe syn on is after colorscheme srace
18:20  homekevin: *slate
18:24  dangerboy: I'm using the vimrc_example as my vimrc with the addition of filetype off
18:24  dangerboy: set runtimepath+=/Users/jamesbailey/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/current/vim/
18:24  dangerboy: filetype on
18:24  dangerboy: at the beginning of my ~/.vimrc. would it be better at the end?
18:25  homekevin: Doesn't look like something that would matter, to me.
18:26  dangerboy: oh well
18:26  homekevin: dangerboy: Try starting vim with -u NONE -U NONE -N, then once it is running source your .vimrc
18:26  homekevin: It may be a plugin that's messing it up
18:28  dangerboy: I don't know know how to start vim from the command line
18:28  dangerboy: at least, not the gui version
18:29  homekevin: dangerboy: type gvim instead of vim?
18:29  dangerboy: doesn't work
18:29  dangerboy: command not found
18:30  homekevin: Well, I can help with Vim problems but not MacOS problems.
18:31  homekevin: Back later
18:35  errordeveloper: when I write email in Vim (with Mutt)
18:36  errordeveloper: the lines don't go longer then certain length,
18:36  errordeveloper: when do I set it ?
18:36  errordeveloper: I wan't to use this functionality for editing TeX as well!
18:37  DHulme: the setting is 'textwidth'
18:38  davek: errordeveloper: set editor="vim -c 'set ft=mail fo=tcrq tw=72'"
18:38  iaj: dangerboy: hmmm which vim do you have installed?
18:39  davek: errordeveloper: put that in your muttrc and be happy ;)
18:39  singlecore: dang got a weird thing goin on here
18:39  singlecore: i cant _backspace_ anymore in insert mode
18:39  DHulme: davek: I don't think setting ft=mail will be very helpful for editing TeX files
18:39  singlecore: ??wtf??
18:39  DHulme: singlecore: check the value of the 'backspace' option
18:43  singlecore: DHulme, it isnt set
18:43  DHulme: there's your problem then
18:44  singlecore: ah ok
18:45  singlecore: DHulme, whats the default value for it?
18:45  DHulme: it's explained in the help
18:46  iaj: a questoin which file stores the indent options for a file - syntax?
18:46  errordeveloper: cool, set tw=72 does just fine :)
18:46  errordeveloper: thanks :)
18:46  DHulme: iaj: indent/thefiletypename.vim
18:47  DHulme: errordeveloper: you can set it from ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex.vim if you want it set automatically when you edit a TeX file
18:47  iaj: DHulme: thanks
18:48  errordeveloper: yeah, I got it set in vimrc now
18:48  errordeveloper: :)
18:48  errordeveloper: hm ..another question ..hm
18:49  errordeveloper: where the shortcut '\c' in edit mode comes from ?
18:49  errordeveloper: when i am typing a tex command which begins with \c, causes commeting of the line ..
18:49  DHulme: errordeveloper: you can find out with :verbose map \c
18:50  singlecore: DHulme, thanks got it now
18:51  davek: DHulme: he's putting that setting in his muttrc, not his vimrc.  so yes, it'll be useful. :)
18:51  DHulme: singlecore: No need to thank me for reminding you you can find things out in the help.
18:51  errordeveloper: i see there many thing ..perhaps I need to disable all of it, but it comes from various scripts ..
18:52  DHulme: davek: he wanted to turn the same settings on for editing TeX files outside of mutt
18:52  singlecore: DHulme, thanks for the slap :)
18:52  errordeveloper: davek: yeah, that what my question was :)
18:52  errordeveloper: :)
18:53  singlecore: ll
18:56  iaj: does someone know if theres an indention script for applescript?
19:01  heoa: Normal mode: I get results with /search/nsearch but not in ":grep -r "search\nsearch". Are the flavours different?
19:01  heoa: err ":grep -r "search\nsearch" *
19:02  heoa: err not /n but \n
19:08  DHulme: iaj: the Vim scripts database probably knows better than anyone here
19:09  iaj: DHulme: yeah.. searched that one - but no success
19:09  DHulme: probably everyone who felt the need to write one was too ashamed to admit to needing to ;)
19:13  dangerboy: iaj, I have VIM - Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Dec  8 2010 18:36:38)
19:13  dangerboy: MacOS X (unix) version
19:15  iaj: Oh no MacVim??? Because I start vim on terminal like: $VIM_APP_DIR/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim  
19:15  iaj: = gui support
19:15  dangerboy: I have MacVim as well, but i'm trying to get through the vimtutor on vim first
19:28  mountained: is it possible to search in all opened files for a pattern?
19:30  iaj: dangerboy: ooh.. and vimtutor doesn't work?
19:31  dangerboy: it does, but only in the terminal. I had to follow the instruction for other systems to get it to work in Vim.app
19:31  dangerboy: I'm slowly starting to understand this
19:32  dangerboy: there's insert and append, which basically do the same thing, the only difference is where you start editing text, right?
19:32  mountained: no idea or not possible?
19:33  dangerboy: there's editing, which obviously lets you edit, and visual, which you use for copying. what's the default?
19:33  DHulme: there's no "edit" mode
19:33  DHulme: there's normal mode
19:33  iaj: mountained: i dunno.. I thought of :he bufdo ... but that doesn't seem to be suited for searches
19:35  dangerboy: okay
19:35  dangerboy: what's normal mode?
19:35  DHulme: the mode you start in
19:35  DHulme: the one you're normally in
19:36  dangerboy: and it's for moving around, right?
19:36  DHulme: (hence the name)
19:36  DHulme: moving around and editing text
19:36  DHulme: and switching files
19:37  dangerboy: so hitting 'r' or something doesn't change modes, that's still normal mode, right?
19:37  DHulme: indeed
19:37  DHulme: but R gets you into replace mode
19:38  dangerboy: oh, replace is a mode
19:39  dangerboy: isn't there a list of commonly used commands? I thought I saw that somewhere
19:39  ws: dangerboy:  just type ":help"..  it really reads like prose
19:40  dangerboy: I'm there
19:43  dangerboy: and editing a file is the same as opening it, right?
19:43  dangerboy: instead of looking for open, I want to edit
19:57  iaj: Some highlight-experts in here :-D  Im having trouble since I try to set different user defined User1 Highlights in my statusbar.. but since I didn't know on how to have ONLY the guibg attribute linked to the StatusBar guibg, i had to 'hardcode' it - however when the Statusbar goes inactive - the trouble shows up -- someone able to help?
20:14  iaj: what is the guibg=fg  doing exactly?
20:19  bsod1: which key to move to end of the line?
20:19  bsod1: in normal mode
20:20  fow: $
20:21  bsod1: fow: thanks
20:23  fow: welcome
20:23  TexasMynsted: hello
20:29  noflex: oki
20:54  iaj: someone able to tell me what to set to &titlestring to have it display the current path of the file only?
20:54  iaj: ah..no ... not the current path to the file.. the current $PWD... i tried let &titlestring=$PWD but that doesn't seem to work
21:00  dangerboy: okay, one more thing. How do I get vim to actually comiple a file? Let's say I want to run latex on a file.
21:04  iaj: either way you :!pdflatex %   or you set makeprg accordingly
21:05  iaj: :he 'makeprg
21:06  dangerboy: makeprg!
21:06  dangerboy: I'll look at that
21:07  abstrakt: anyone here use ubuntu?
21:07  abstrakt: specifically ubuntu 10.10?
21:07  abstrakt: I'm not sure if this is a vim issue or an ubuntu issue
21:07  cirwin: abstrakt: neither are we
21:07  abstrakt: I'm missing my vim icon in the window manager
21:08  abstrakt: like I have the vim icon in my start menu, and i have the vim icon on my dock/launcher/panel/whatever
21:08  abstrakt: but when i actually run the program, I have just a default application icon (like generic gnome application icon) in both the workspace switcher and in the taskbar
21:08  abstrakt: I can't find an answer to this on google eithere
21:08  abstrakt: the closest I found was this http://www.linux-archive.org/xubuntu-user/110024-gvim-window-icon-missing.html
21:08  abstrakt: but there's no response yet
21:09  cirwin: that sounds more like a packaging problem than a vim problem, but maybe someone here will know anyway
21:10  abstrakt: yeah, I mean it's not the hugest problem... gvim works fine, but... it's just like always constantly slightly annoying and grating on me :P
21:10  abstrakt: I <3 vim and I want my icon!
21:11  cirwin: you can ask for a discount, 10% off with missing icon :)
21:11  abstrakt: heh
21:11  abstrakt: I mean, I'm sure I could fix it myself, but I have far more important things I need to be doing :(
21:30  dangerboy: so, should make prompt me to issue the command to compile? or is that handled by the compiler options?

22:26  iaj: is there any setting like &statusbar for the inactive statusbar?
22:44  iaj: can I somehow read the setting from a certain Highlightgroup (for example the guibg) setting into a variable..??
22:45  fow: iaj, :h :redir
22:46  iaj: fow: hmm I more ment to have let b:variable = getMeThe_GUIBG_SettingFrom(StatusLine)
