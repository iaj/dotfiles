01:28  jamessan: strull: http://vim.pastey.net/141769 doesn't work?
01:28  Rakko: most things I've seen that use hard tabs seem to assume that tabstop=4
01:29  Rakko: I did notice vimtutor uses ts=8 though
01:29  strull: jamessan: no. Easy to try.
01:29  godlygeek: Rakko: as do the vim help files.
01:29  godlygeek: Rakko: and everything else that has ever used tabs to display tabular data.
01:29  jamessan: s/the vim.*/all of Vim's source/
01:29 --- Channel #vim was synced in 81 seconds
01:30  ironm: strull, can you put such code (http://vim.pastey.net/141768) into your .vimrc ??
01:30  Rakko: It's certainly *possible* to display tabular data using whatever tab size you choose
01:30  jamessan: Rakko: in applications that let you adjust the tab size, sure. but the default tab size is 8
01:30  godlygeek: ironm: sure
01:30  godlygeek: Rakko: no, not really.
01:31  Rakko: well, you have a point that terminals tend to use 8
01:31  godlygeek: Rakko: tabular data will have been written assuming a particular tabstop.  you can't change that tabstop and still have the data appear correctly.
01:31  jamessan: strull: and what's the :<BS> for in the second map?
01:31  godlygeek: not knowing the <silent> modifier, i wager.  :)
01:31  strull: jamessan: to clear the message-line. It annoys me.
01:31  Rakko: I wish tabs were a little different, e.g. you would be forced to insert a ^I every time you wanted to advance to the next column
01:32  ironm: godlygeek, I am not sure if you are serious or just kidding *_* ...
01:32  jamessan: strull: yeah, as godlygeek mentioned you should just make it "map <silent> <m-e> ..."
01:32  Rakko: I just noticed that using <silent> with cmap produces undesirable results
01:32  strull: jamessan: probably. But this works well for me. I had strange effects with <silent> in the past. I don't want to get trapped again
01:35  godlygeek: ironm: kidding about what?  tabs?
01:36  ironm: godlygeek, no ... about the function ... http://vim.pastey.net/141768 .. I have put it inside .vimrc *but don't" see any difference when searching with "/pattern"
01:37  ironm: the tabs (set to 4) work as expected
01:38  jamessan: ironm: that paste wasn't directed at you
01:39  ironm: that is true jamessan .. however I like to learn new stuff ;)
01:39  godlygeek: ironm: it didn't change the behavior of /, it bound a new keystrokes - alt-e
01:39  jamessan: ironm: well, it's a map to move the cursor to the end of the current search pattern, so it doesn't have anything directly to do with /
01:40  strull: ironm: try :set hls to get the feeling
01:40  ironm: oOH :) .. thank you very much for your explanation ++
01:40  ironm: strull, .. tnx . I will try it
01:46  ironm: *cool stuff* .. this function and ":set hls" ! ... merci :))
02:17  Rakko: ooh, gf works even when the name has a shell variable
02:18  Rakko: speaking of tab, I was just considering mapping <Tab> to <Esc> and just using <C-i> for tab... but then I realized the mapping would change both :(
02:19  jamessan: yup, at least until terminals learn to tell the difference between the two
02:19  itmorr: Hey..got a question.  How do I configure vim to support work in this environment?:  Me -works on-> Server A   <-download/upload files via SFTP->   Remote Server B
02:20  Rakko: hi jeff
02:20  Rakko: I think vim has built-in sftp support
02:20  itmorr: Ex. NetBeans has this functionality.  It supports local copy of the file, which is editted, and when the local copy is saved in the IDE, it can be automatically uploaded to the remote server.
02:24  jamessan: itmorr: :help netrw-start
02:27 --- robglees_ is now known as robgleeson
02:29  Rakko: oh, speaking of netrw
02:29  Rakko: is it possible to select a file in a directory and then use a hotkey to go back to the same directory?
02:29  jamessan: Rakko: maybe :help netrw-bookmarks
02:30  Rakko: thanks
02:34  rudi_s: Rakko: I can recommend to map CapsLock as Ctrl and map to jj <esc>.
02:35  trevor: I'm want to use either the current yanked text or the word my cursor is on in a command
02:35  Rakko: I have caps lock=ctrl but I don't like jj
02:36  trevor: Easiest way?
02:36  Rakko: trevor: the word the cursor is on can be gotten with the iw operator
02:36  Rakko: *iw motion
02:37  Rakko: I'm not sure what register yank uses by default
02:37  Rakko: did you mean in a : command?
02:37  trevor: Yes
02:38  trevor: I want to :Ack [current_word]
02:38  Rakko: hmm, not sure how you would use the cursor word in :
02:38  trevor: It seems like a common thing I'd want to do
02:38  Rakko: but for a yanked register you can hit ctrl+r and then the register character
02:38  Rakko: oh, it's ""
02:39  Rakko: so ctrl+r "
02:39  itmorr: Hey, the help pages are small in my terminal.  Any way to get the page to fill the screen?
02:39  Rakko: itmorr: ctrl+w o
02:39  itmorr: thanks!
02:39  Rakko: sure
02:39  itmorr: How do I flip it back?
02:40  Rakko: hmm, I'm not sure you can go back directly
02:40  Rakko: you can split the screen again with ctrl+w s
02:40  Rakko: but then you have two windows looking at the same help page
02:40  itmorr: okie dokie
02:41  Rakko: :h windows has info on switching between windows, splitting and unsplitting, etc.
02:41  trevor: Rakko: Cool, :Ack <Ctrl+R>" did what I wanted
02:41  Rakko: yay
02:42  trevor: Somehow getting the word my cursor is on would be cool too, I think
02:42  trevor: I'm new to vim and just experimenting :)
02:42  Rakko: me too... it's fun
02:43  Rakko: you can yank the cursor's word with yiw
02:43  Rakko: then do the command the same as I told you
02:46  trevor: What is the difference between yiw and yw?
02:47  trevor: I can't see a difference
02:47  spiiph: put the cursor on the middle of the word
02:47  strull: trevor: you'll see it if your cursor is not on the first character of a word
02:48  trevor: I see
02:48  trevor: Cool
02:51  lumgwada: yw really should be whole word though seeings ye does the same thing. thats one redundant keypress
02:53  strull: lumgwada: not true
02:57  lumgwada: strull: you mean the whitespace?
02:58  dsdeiz: hi, i've added hi Normal ctermbg=NONE in my vimrc though it seems that it's being set somewhere else again.. is there like a way to determine what set it?
02:58  strull: yes, or whatever else delimits the word
02:58 --- estragib_ is now known as estragib
02:59  trevor: Hmm, ok I'm searching with Ack and when I find something is changes the window
03:00  trevor: Say I'm done reading and want to go to the previous window
03:00  trevor: Whatever file was in this window before the current one
03:00  spiiph: <C-6>
03:00  trevor: beautiful, thanks :)
03:02  spiiph: Also. :h jumplist
03:04  dsdeiz: hm, how do i determine what set a settings again?
03:05  jamessan: dsdeiz: ":verbose set foo?"
03:06  dsdeiz: heheh. didn't work with hi Normal, was wondering what set it again after i've set it in my .vimrc
03:07  spiiph: dsdeiz, It'll be reset if the colorscheme is reloaded, either by reloading your .vimrc or a session
03:08  jamessan: dsdeiz: in that case, it'd be ":verbose hi Normal"
03:10  dsdeiz: spiiph: yeah.. i reloaded my .vimrc and my config for hi Normal set it. though when i start vim it seems that some setting is overriding it
03:11  dsdeiz: jamessan: it showed the hi Normal but not the file that have set it
03:16  dsdeiz: oh ok. so the colorscheme is loaded after the vimrc?
03:17  Rakko: wow... OS X Terminal requires the shift for C-^
03:19  spiiph: Maybe Terminal uses <C-#> to switch tabs, or something just as silly?
03:19  dsdeiz: yey, works now :D
03:20  itmorr: jamessan, netrw would allow me to edit files remotely, but what about editting files locally?  For example, the use case is: If the files were on the local computer (Downloaded from the server), and I wanted it to automatically upload it to the server whenever I write the file, and then download the latest version afterwards?
03:21  jamessan: itmorr: that's exactly what netrw does.  it copies the remote file locally and then when you save puts the file to the remote location.  how do you expect netrw to know where the file is supposed to go if it's already local?
03:22  itmorr: Don't know, but NetBeans knows -- you can specify a folder root and it knows where all the files are supposed to go.
03:23  itmorr: Example is, what if I want to cd around the directories on the local machine, and edit them, and have it automatically upload on write?  Another is, could I make it so that it would automatically download the latest version of the file when I go vim <file>?
03:23  infid: how do you un-tab ball?
03:23  jamessan: infid: :tabonly
03:24  jamessan: itmorr: you can, yes, but you'll have to do your own scripting to accomplish that
03:25  itmorr: cool, think anyone's already done it?  Where could I go to find out how to script automatic sequences on write and read?
03:27  infid: jamessan: thanks
03:37  Rakko: spiiph: oh... OS X's Spaces uses Ctrl+numbers by default to switch workspaces
03:42  infid: my vertically split windows have a very thin border, almost unseeable. how can i change the width/color?
03:54 --- Natch is now known as Natch|
03:55  wooden: itmorr: there is a utility called 'vidir' that allows you to rename/delete files in vim.  it's part of the 'moreutils' package in debian-derived distros.

04:50  Araxia: agenteo: do you use vimperator?
04:50  agenteo: nope, I am only interested in editing a textarea content from vim
04:51  agenteo: texto works ok, except it doesn't feed the current text to vim, maybe I have to specify an inline option
05:25  Rakko: ugh, way to suck, OS X Finder
05:25  lewis1711: what are those things in some IDES etc called that are basically a vertical line on the right hand side to stop you writing overly long lines of code?
05:25  Rakko: if you drag a folder from one place to another place that already has a folder by that name, and answer yes, it will totally replace the old folder
05:25  Rakko: I thought it would just merge the folders
05:25  lewis1711: want to get one in vim but dunno what to google for:/
05:25  Rakko: those are guidelines
05:25  Rakko: or guide lines
05:26  Rakko: I have vim specially color the background of characters at and near the edge of the screen
05:26  jamessan: lewis1711: if you have vim 7.3, :help 'colorcolumn
05:26  lewis1711: yeah actually I suppose vim can't really draw a line to a terminal
05:26  lewis1711: ah
05:26  Rakko: https://wincent.com/blog/highlighting-overlength-lines-in-vim
05:27  jamessan: lewis1711: also, you might want to check  :help 'textwidth  so that you can make Vim automatically wrap lines that would exceed a certain length
05:27  Rakko: o rly, jamessan?
05:27  lewis1711: that may be easier
05:30  lewis1711: ok I feel like a right plank.. I can't figure the syntax from that helpfile for my vim rc
05:30  lewis1711: "set tw 120" ain't doing the trick
05:30  jamessan: lewis1711: set tw=120
05:31  lewis1711: ahh durp
05:31  lewis1711: ty
05:34  Rakko: do I need a .vim/doc/tags file?
05:35  jamessan: Need? no. can be useful, yes
05:35  Rakko: is it generated by vim itself? because I don't remember creating it
05:36  Rakko: nor do I know how to keep it up to date
05:36  jamessan: it's created by something running ":helptags ~/.vim/doc"
05:36  Rakko: ok
05:36  Rakko: maybe it got created by a vimball I ran
05:36  jamessan: some plugins inanely auto-generate their docs the first time they're sourced, so you may be using one of those
05:37  jamessan: maybe
05:41  Rakko: I just noticed that when I run vimdiff, it complains about my setting "set conceallevel=0"
05:41  Rakko: E518: Unknown option: conceallevel=0
05:41  Rakko: but run as vim or gvim, it doesn't complain
05:41  jamessan: you're running OS X and have vim as an alias to mvim
05:41  jamessan: so you either need to setup another alias or use vim -d
05:42  jamessan: or modify your vimrc to check for the feature before setting the option
05:43  Rakko: ok, yes, I am using macvim, but I'm confused
05:44  Rakko: why would the vimdiff link parse .vimrc differently?
05:44  jamessan: because it's not pointing to mvim
05:44  Rakko: ohhhh
05:44  Rakko: duh. yeah, system vim it is.
05:58  infid: how come :set ma! doesn't show [RO] for read-only?
06:01  strull: because it's not the same. try :set ro!
06:04  infid: what's the diff?
06:05  strull: well. It's explained under :he 'mod and :he 'ro
06:05  infid: oh, ro isn't as strict, lets you edit but not save
06:05  infid: thanks
06:27  Rakko: surround is cool
07:02  vaxerdec: hello, is there a way to have vim syntax highlight in a pipeline? i know about TOhtml but i'm looking for something i can just pipe to e.g. "less -r"
07:05  Rakko: vaxerdec: I have a script that does that
07:06  Rakko: I will send it to you
07:06  Rakko: (I didn't write it but I don't think it's on the web)
07:13  vaxerdec: rakko, hey, that works
07:14  Rakko: cool
07:14  vaxerdec: rakko, now that's cool...
07:14  Rakko: for anyone else interested: http://rakko.homeunix.com:8089/~eric/vimcat.vim
07:14  vaxerdec: trying to figure out how it works
07:14  Rakko: written by Matthew Wozniski... I dunno if he's still active in Vim
07:18  strull: Rakko: I think so. He is known as godlygeek here
07:18  Rakko: no wai!
07:18  Rakko: well thanks, godlygeek :)
07:20  vaxerdec: that's really awesome script.  i would never have known how to implement that
07:20  Rakko: me neither
07:20  Rakko: I did make two fixes to it
07:20  Rakko: I should let him know
07:21  vaxerdec: i like how it's a bash script that executes itself using vim as the interpreter
07:21  Rakko: yeah
07:21  vaxerdec: so basically standalone... and it looks like it's picking up all my syntax highlighting settings too
07:22  strull: yes, he's a damn perfectionist :)
07:22  vaxerdec: Rakko: you added line 126?
07:23  Rakko: yes
07:23  Rakko: and changed 125 but then commented it out to use 126 instead
07:28  dsdeiz: ahh matthew wozniski == godlygeek?
07:28  dsdeiz: dang.. didn't read the previous messages hehe
07:32  kaushal: hi

07:33  Rakko: soramimi
07:33  kaushal: I have about 200 files, is there a way to delete the first line using for loop ?
07:33  kaushal: delete the first line in all the files
07:34  lumgwada: kaushal: http://www.computing.net/answers/unix/delete-first-line-of-a-file/7594.html
07:35  lumgwada: so most likely sed -i '1d' *.filelist
07:36  kaushal: ok
07:36  Rakko: in vim, you could load them all into buffers, :set hidden, and then do :bufdo 1d
07:41  kaushal: lumgwada: I also have a slight issue
07:41  kaushal: the first line contains
07:42  kaushal: ^@^@^@^@^@^@Processing ContactImport at 01-10-2010 02-50-27
07:42  kaushal: I am interested in deleting characters upto ^@^@^@^@^@^@
07:49  Rakko: kaushal, is that a binary file?
07:49  kaushal: Rakko: part binary and part text
07:49  Rakko: oh
07:50  Rakko: you don't want to delete the ^@ characters? just up to them?
07:50  kaushal: I want to delete all ^@ characters
07:50  lumgwada: kaushal: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/how-to-use-sed-to-delete-all-lines-before-the-first-match-of-a-pattern-802069/ with \w as the first match?

08:59  brubelsabs: Is there a way to put all opened files in a seperate window? I stumbled upon the file explorer :Exp, but I guess this is not really what I am searching for. What I search is a sidebar of opened, files in different directories...
09:06  ondrejk: brubelsabs: buffers?
09:07  brubelsabs: ondrejk: yes, since I allways forget about which files I've opened, I must type :ls from time to time. Since I have screen space left :D, I would favour a sidebar with all opened files.
09:07  brubelsabs: or a separate buffer with just :ls
09:07  ondrejk: you can split your screen
09:08  brubelsabs: ondrejk: Ok, I know screen splitting, but when typing :ls then, its still in the bottom line
09:09  brubelsabs: ondrejk: And how about updates if a new files is opened?
09:09  ondrejk: brubelsabs: autocommands
09:10  ondrejk: now we need to figure out how display ls contents in other window
09:10  brubelsabs: ondrejk: ok, maybe I am too lazy.. I though this had been done already :)
09:10  ondrejk: brubelsabs: thats also possible :)
09:11  ondrejk: laziness is engine of human progress :)
09:12  brubelsabs: NERDTree?
09:12  qiyong: is this right to add ; at then end line each
09:12  qiyong: :%s/\n/\;\n/g
09:13  ondrejk: qiyong: it if it works :)
09:13  ondrejk: qiyong: but you can use also :s/$/;/
09:13  brubelsabs: qiyong: note: if there is already a ';' then there are maybe twice in the end.
09:14  ondrejk: then :%s/\v;{0}$/;/
09:15  qiyong: whats \v?
09:15  ondrejk: magic toggle
09:15  DHulme: ondrejk: that doesn't work
09:15  ondrejk: quaestor: :help magic
09:16  DHulme: you can always match 0 of ; at end-of-line; it just means the match doesn't include the ; if one is there
09:16  DHulme: you need :%s/[^;]\zs$/;

12:18  ChrisBuchholz: Hey guys. I'm experiencing some odd behavior from vim. Suddenly, after i did some changes in my .vimrc file, vim started, when i launch vim, do 'Press ENTER or type a command to continue' and when i quit when, i prints all my settings from my .vimrc file. Whats up with this? Some error on my .vimrc or something?
12:19  Hukka: Well, if you undo the changes, does it work again?
12:20  Hukka: Not that I know that much about vim, but would seem like a easy way to find out if your settings are to blame
12:21  ChrisBuchholz: Hukka: problem is, i started notificing it some days ago, but didnt think much of it. Today it hit me, but now its too late to undo the changes because i dont remember what it was
12:21  Hukka: Er, ok
12:21  Hukka: Well, you need to put the vimrc on pastebin so that anyone can say if it's that or not
12:24  ChrisBuchholz: Hukka: here it is http://gist.github.com/632013
12:32  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: it's probably because of a plugin you installed recently - your .vimrc looks safe to me
12:32  FernandoBasso: No.
12:32  FernandoBasso: I tried  ChrisBuchholz's vimrc and the problem happens here as well.
12:33  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: no idea whats causing it, no?
12:33  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I'm trying to figure out.
12:34  ChrisBuchholz: yeah, okay, FernandoBasso
12:34  rson: ChrisBuchholz: while he is looking at that, can you paste the output of :scriptnames ?
12:35  FernandoBasso: I bet it a bug in the colorscheme you are using.
12:35  iaj: Can I somehow remove a line beginning with - to be aligned 2 spaces to the right when I gqap ?
12:35  FernandoBasso: No...
12:36  ChrisBuchholz: rson: http://gist.github.com/632021
12:36  FernandoBasso: iaj: that was not for you.
12:36  iaj: FernandoBasso: :D
12:37  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i'm confident that the bug appeared a long while after i started using that colorscheme, so i would say no, of course without really knowing
12:37  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Okay. I said that based on what appears in terminal afters we close vim (using your vimrc)
12:38  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i think it started to appear around the time i added 'nnoremap <C-Esc> :noh<return>', but i'm not really sure
12:38  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i'll try changing the colorscheme
12:38  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: That is not the problem. Sure.
12:39  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: The problem must be one or your plugins then.
12:39  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: its still where, even when i'm not using the colorscheme
12:40  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: the only plugin i have added my self is the unimpaired one
12:40  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Try backuping it and opening vim without it.
12:41  FernandoBasso: Hmm. NO. Because I don't have it here. So the problem is not it.
12:41  ChrisBuchholz: oh, and sessionman, i also added myself
12:41  ChrisBuchholz: oh, yeah, i see, makes sense
12:42  rson: what about starting vim with -u ~/.vimrc ?
12:42  rson: that would rule out your vimrc as the problem if it doesn't show up there
12:44  ChrisBuchholz: rson: if i do 'vim -u ~/.vimrc', the bug is still there, but so is all my .vimrc settings
12:46  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: delete the line 'set highlight'.
12:47  rson: ChrisBuchholz: ChrisBuchholz doh, i thought -u would skip all plugins, it seems it doesn't.  my bad.
12:47  FernandoBasso: I think you mean, set syntax on.
12:47  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: that indeed worked!
12:47  rson: nice catch
12:48  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: the 'set syntax on' isnt equivalent to my line 5 'syntax on'?
12:49  ChrisBuchholz: that should, perhabs be 'set syntax on'?
12:49  kongo: FernandoBasso: good one, I overlooked that one
12:50  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I think so.
12:50  ChrisBuchholz: okay
12:51  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: the 'set highlight' was actually meant to highlight searches
12:51  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Type it in vim itlsef and see for yourself what it does.
12:51  ChrisBuchholz: yeah
12:52  ChrisBuchholz: woaw, now when i exit vim, the colorscheme still flaunts the shell
12:52  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I think you want :set hlsearch.
12:52  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: yeah, i think so too :P
12:53  ChrisBuchholz: okay, for some reason, it stopped again luckily
12:53  ChrisBuchholz: thank you for you help, guys ;)
12:54  ChrisBuchholz: damn, no. If i start vim and then do :q, vim exits but the shell is still 'using' the colorscheme
12:55  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: What OS and what shell and terminal?
12:56  ChrisBuchholz: ubuntu 10.10, bash, gnome-terminal. it didnt do this before
12:57  FernandoBasso: That is virtually impossible. The shell alone use vim colorcheme.
12:57  FernandoBasso: Hmm.
12:58  FernandoBasso: I have no idea. Sorry. I also use gnome-terminal sometimes, but I have never seem something like that.
12:58  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: thank you anyways
12:59  FernandoBasso: Perhaps a compiz issue...
12:59  ChrisBuchholz: perhabs.
13:06  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i'm curious, what terminal do you use when you're not using gnome-terminal ?
13:07  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I use rxvt-unicode-256color or xterm. I also use gvim, but I drop all menus, scrollbars and everything that makes it a 'gui'.
13:08  FernandoBasso: I like the font rendering, the cursor style and the colors support in the gui, but I dislike the other things that make it a gui. :D
13:08  FernandoBasso: So, my gui vim looks like a xterm.
13:08  dwarder: my gui vim just doesn't look
13:08  dwarder: ;)
13:09  dwarder: 'cause i don't use it
13:11  FernandoBasso: http://jeditux.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/archlinux-openbox-irssi-conky-vim-screenshots/ <-- Here's a screenshot on how gvim looks like.
13:11  FernandoBasso: dwarder: What OS ?

16:08  gkatsev: how can I change directories to the directory of the current file? 'cd expand('%:h')' is not working for me
16:09  rson: :cd %:p:h
16:09  remi: is there a command similar to :tabonly, but that closes all buffers except the active one?
16:09  gkatsev: rson: oh, I thought you needed expand in there
16:10  gkatsev: rson: yeah, not working
16:10  rson: i just tried it and it works for me
16:11  gkatsev: rson: yeah, it works, sorry, accidentally was using echo rather than cd
16:11  mgedmin: remi, there's :only, but I'm not sure that's what you want
16:12  mgedmin: how do you define "close a buffer"?
16:12  rson: gkatsev: yeah, :p does the expansion for you
16:14  mgedmin: any chance of mapping Alt-Backspace in command-line mode to "delete up to the previous /"?
16:15  gkatsev: mgedmin: probably not. Cant your terminal/vim see <A-BS>?
16:15  mgedmin: yes
16:15  gkatsev: then you could
16:16  mgedmin: my difficulty is coming up with the right rhs
16:16  gkatsev: heh, yeah
16:16  mgedmin: I've currently mapped it to <C-W>, which deletes too much
16:16  mgedmin: and, unlike bash, there's no Ctrl-Y to restore the long painfully-tab-completed path I just nuked
16:18  Evanlec: how would i match a funky character that shows up in vim as <200e>
16:18  Evanlec: want to remove them
16:18  mgedmin: Evanlec, yank it, then :%s/<C-R>"//g
16:18  gkatsev: mgedmin: take a look at :h c_CTRL-W and then :h 'isk'
16:19  gkatsev: you could probably also search exactly for <200e>
16:19  Evanlec: apparently its a unicode left to right mark
16:19  mgedmin: there's a syntax for matching unicode characters by their code, check :h pattern
16:19  Evanlec: no idea why thats in here, must be from open-office spreadsheet
16:20  Evanlec: its sposed to be a straight csv, but open-office mangles it
16:20  liamjfoy: Hello, does anyone have an example with VIM for doing: 'find each occurance of foo(*) and replace * with what I type' ?
16:21  mgedmin: liamjfoy, different "what you type"?
16:21  mgedmin: I mean, different each time?
16:21  liamjfoy: So, for each foo(*) it finds I can input and escape with some character?
16:21  liamjfoy: then onto the next...
16:21  liamjfoy: mgedmin: yes :)
16:21  mgedmin: you could record a macro -- /foo(/eci(
16:22  gkatsev: you dont need.
16:22  mgedmin: and there should be a <cr> after /foo(/e
16:22  gkatsev: just do a replacement
16:22  gkatsev: then s/&/
16:22  liamjfoy: gkatsev: ?
16:22  gkatsev: & will get the last pattern from the replacement
16:22 * mgedmin wonders why / is in 'iskeyword' by default
16:22  gkatsev: you'll have to run the command several times.
16:23  gkatsev: :%s/\(foo(\).*/\1r1<CR> :%s/&/\1r2 etc
16:24  Evanlec: gkatsev: searchin directly for <200e> didnt seem to work
16:24  gkatsev: yeah, I guess not. But as mgedmin said, yank and <C-r>"
16:24  Evanlec: mgedmin: <C-R> does weird things
16:25  Evanlec: doing that seems to insert the entire text into my ex window
16:25  gkatsev: not <C-S-R> either
16:26  Evanlec: oh, k, now it workede
16:26  Evanlec: weird
16:26  Evanlec: thats funny, unicode left-to-right characters
16:26  Evanlec: as if those were somehow necessary
16:27  mgedmin: they could be, for BiDi text -- I'm clueless about how that is supposed to work
16:28  Evanlec: apparently openoffice spreadsheet thought they were important to inject
16:28  liamjfoy: gkatsev: mgedmin thank you :)
16:29  Evanlec: when loading a csv file, open-office spreadsheet should not alter the file in any way without notifying the user
16:30  Evanlec: thats annoying, means you can't trust the damn thing
16:30  gkatsev: OOo is a piece of crap anyway...
16:30  Evanlec: well granted
16:30  Evanlec: but for this scenario it was easier to work on this in a spreadsheet than a text editor
16:31  gkatsev: yeah
16:31 * mgedmin likes gnumeric, which is probably also crap
16:31  Evanlec: i like how it stripped my leading zeros off my zipcode column
16:31  Evanlec: as if it knew better than me what data type i had there
16:43  spiiph: Evanlec, I'm sure close to all spread sheet programs do the same. They can convert it to a number, and that's what they do.

19:15  Scala_: When expandtab is on, is it possible to have vim delete 4 spaces on backspace?
19:16  Scala_: basically just looking for tab functionality with spaces instead
19:19  deryni: See the help for 'sw 'sta and 'sts .
19:20  kongo: Scala_: :set sts=4 should do the trick
19:34  {g}: Hey People! Im using vim for years now and I love love love it. But one thing still baffles me: When I hit "i" and then "esc" the cursor is moved one position to the left. Why why why? I went into insert mode and I left insert mode. I did not tell the cursor to move. Why did it move?
19:36  fow: When you're in normal mode, the cursor is on a character. you enter insert mode and go before this character. While in insert mode, the cursor is between two characters. you press escape to go to normal mode, and the cursor chooses left. Perhaps use a, though I'm not sure how often one would be entering insert mode, doing nothing, then exiting it again
19:38  {g}: ok, i think that explains it. thank you.
19:39  {g}: the terminal cannot display a | between two characters? maybe that would make clear that the cursor is between two characters.
19:39  DHulme: no, it can't, but gVim does that
19:40  {g}: i really loooove the terminal. so i use vim in the terminal.
19:40  fow: you're welcome
19:40  DHulme: I think one or two terminals might have an extension to do that these days, but I don't know which ones
19:40  deryni: I believe some terminals can do that, though probably not controllable via vim modes.
19:41  {g}: Can you imagine that I didnt notice that beer tastes nice until I was 39?
19:41  DHulme: beer doesn't taste nice
19:41  DHulme: it tastes like stale sweat
19:41  tmr: You should try different brand.

19:42  skered: But beer doesn't taste good
19:43  skered: It just taste less bad than another

20:20  NickASloan: strull_: is there by any chance a way to figure out with of those is overriding my shiftwidth setting?
20:20  NickASloan: *which
20:20  strull_: yes, try :verbose set sw
20:21  NickASloan: strull_: it's not showing me anything. Does this work for Vim on Windows?
20:22  NickASloan: (all it shows is the current sw value)
20:22  strull_: it should work on all flavours of vim
20:23  NickASloan: oh weird
20:23  NickASloan: it works for other options
20:23  NickASloan: just not showing anything for shiftwidth
20:23  NickASloan: so shiftwidth isn't being overridden, it's just not being set

20:32  gmorek: Hi, is it possible to create two different menus for vim? For example the normal emenu one on <F4> and a custom one on <F5>?
20:47  dindinx: gmorek: you can probably do that by mapping F4 and F5 to functions that modify the menu.
20:49  gmorek: thanks dindinx, that idea I had two, but I thought this would only be some kind of work around
20:50  gmorek: s/two/too/
20:52  d0ugal: I seem to have done something in my vimrc that is breaking functionality. When I do a 'git commit' and :wq I always get "Aborting commit due to empty commit message."
20:52  d0ugal: Any suggestions?
20:54  strull_: I gues your git is configured badly
20:54  strull_: or you $EDITOR setting is wrong.
20:55  mcantor: How do I read and set options using vimscript?
20:56  Raimondi: mcantor: presede the option with &  -> &filetype
20:56  mcantor: Raimondi: So they are just like variables?
20:57  mcantor: Ok... what's the best way to say, in my vimrc, "set this option ONLY for certain filetypes?"
20:57  Raimondi: With that format, you can use :let
20:57  mcantor: (I know I could modify the plugin, but I'd rather do it in my .vimrc so it's portable.)
20:57  Raimondi: YOu can use autocmd
20:57  Raimondi: :h :au
20:57  subsume: Can someone help me cook up some regexp that will match only strings encapsulated within a single <p> tag? I want it to get <p>foo</p> and not <p>some</p><p>foo</p>
20:58  mcantor: Raimondi: Autocmd only works with paths--I want to use the filetype.
20:58  Raimondi: subsume:  :h /\{
20:58  strull_: mcantor: what makes you think so?
20:58  subsume: Raimondi, just an escaped backslash?
20:58  Raimondi: mcantor:  au FileType cpp set noexpandtab
20:59  mcantor: subsume: You almost definitely do not want to do this with regexes; regexes are super-bad at parsing nested syntax.
20:59  subsume: mcantor, yeah. welp now that I've asked #vim I can settle on that conclusion. =)
21:00  NickASloan: so when Vim does tab completion for file names, I've found an annoyance
21:00  Somelauw: snipmate vs supertab
21:00  mcantor: Raimondi: I've never seen au used that way...
21:01  Raimondi: mcantor: The Fileype event matches the pattern against the filetype.
21:01  mcantor: Raimondi: LOL... yes, I see--I literally read that line in the help file as you said it!
21:01  NickASloan: if I tab complete to a directory name, it completes the name with a /, so I have to delete it and then add it again before I can tab through the directory's subdirectories
21:02  Raimondi: I must have read it too many times :)
21:02  NickASloan: has anyone found a way around this?
21:02  mcantor: Raimondi: The help page could be much clearer in that respect.  Does Mr. Moolenaar take suggestions on such things?
21:02  mcantor: NickASloan: this is just a hunch, but look through :he readline
21:03  mcantor: NickASloan: If you read through the manpage for readline, you'll see that the "mark-directories" option controls the behavior that you're describing.
21:03  mcantor: Perhaps there's a way to change vim's readline options.
21:04  fow: Vim doesn't use readline
21:04  deryni: NickASloan: What happens if you just hit tab again after the completed /?
21:04  deryni: Also what do you have 'wildmode set to?
21:04  mcantor: fow: Whoops... :-)
21:05  Raimondi: NickASloan: I use <Down>, I don't have to delete the /
21:18  ankk: how can i put mkdir to beginning of all lines in vim with sed?
21:18  ankk: mkdir word ...
21:19  deryni: :%s/^/mkdir /
21:19  Kiruwa: ankk: do you mean %s/^/mkdir /
21:19  ankk: hm yeap
21:19  ankk: thank you
21:19  NickASloan: deryni: if there is another file at the current path that matches the pattern (let's assume I'm just tabbing without typing anything, so any file would match) it will go to the next file. If there is no other file, it goes into the directory
21:21  jhaddad: is there a way to execute a command with !, and have the result go into the end of my file?
21:21  strull_: try :r !cmd
21:22  jhaddad: awesome
21:22  jhaddad: thank you

21:24  consumerism: to insert something in the first column of a bunch of lines i can use visual-block mode. how can i do a similar thing but append to the end of a bunch of lines (of differing lengths)?
21:24  deryni: You could always just type another slash, but yeah that is a bit annoying.
21:24  rson: consumerism: $ instead of I
21:25  strull_: consumerism: A instead of I
21:25  rson: A*
21:25  rson: doh
21:25  flazz: is there a way to chmod a file in netrw?
21:25  consumerism: ah, what i was missing was visual-block then $ to get to the end of every line...thanks
21:26  consumerism: my selection wasn't reaching the end of every line so my A was in the middle of some
21:27  jhaddad: can i put the result of a ! in the quickfix window?
21:34  ManDay: Is it possible to: "Soft"wrap line at a certain width on the screen? And then have the hl-key move through the APPARENT lines?
21:34  ManDay: I don't even manage to do the first, I thought wrapmargin would do but it does nothing for me
21:48  jbwiv_: guys, I'm using vim + NERDtree and really like it (for Rails stuff). However, I'd really like a way to hit a key sequence, type a string, and have a list of all files in the currently opened tree that match that string be listed for potential opening. anyone know of a way to do this?
21:50  domidimi: jbwiv_: see fuzzyfinder and command-t plugins
21:50  jbwiv_: domidimi: ok, thanks
21:53  domidimi: ManDay: what do you mean by soft wrap? Isn't :set wrap what you need?
21:54  creidiki: jbwiv_: also lusty explorer
21:54  NemesisD: hi
21:55  FernandoBasso: NemesisD: Hi.
21:55  jbwiv_: creidiki: ok, thanks
21:56  creidiki: jbwiv_: also note that command-t and lusty need ruby
21:56  jbwiv_: creidiki, not a problem ;)
21:57  NemesisD: anyone know a good way of compiling from within vim? a friend of mine uses emacs and has a flymake plugin which parses compile errors from the code and highlights erroneous lines
21:57  fow: NemesisD, :make works well enough for me
21:57  creidiki: i use lusty myself, as it does both general filesystem navigator and finder, but command-t is better as a pure "find file with name in subdird"
22:01  ChrisBuchholz: Hey again guys. I'm still not getting the right colorscheme in vim in screen. I have been asking for help at #screen, but a working solution has yet to be found. I have installed the ncurses package and set 'term screen' in my .screenrc. $TERM out of screen returns xterm, while in screen returns screen. This is the difference i'm experiencing, where to uppermost is in screen and the bottommost is just in gnome-terminal: http://dl.dropb
22:01  FernandoBasso: NemesisD: Have you tried :make ? Give it a try and check :help :make.
22:05  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: try 'term screen-256color' in your .screenrc if you have a 256 terminal
22:06  NemesisD: FernandoBasso: i was more looking for syntax highlighting on save for languages like ruby, erlang, etc
22:06  NemesisD: it turns out theres a flymake port for vim but it seems abandoned and is kinda buggy
22:07  fow: "on save"?
22:07  NemesisD: when a file is saved, for example
22:08  fow: you want syntax highlighting saved in the file?
22:08  fow: you should just need :syntax on and possibly :filetype plugin on
22:08  NemesisD: executed when saved
22:09  NemesisD: i may have found something though, syntastic
22:10  fow: I am really confused. execute syntax highlighting when a file is saved? I don't know what that means.
22:11  NemesisD: when a file is saved, syntax mistakes and warnings should be highlighted within the file
22:12  fow: oh, I see what you mean. you want any errors from the compiler or whatever to be highlighted
22:13  NemesisD: yeah, and i think syntastic can be finagled to do that :)
22:16  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: i tried first, but it doesnt work
22:19  consumerism: how can i make persistent bookmarks in netrw? when i bookmark a page, it's gone after i exit and reopen vim
22:19  consumerism: bookmark a file/dir*
22:19  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: works here, without problems
22:21  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: its the exact same result if it says screen or screen-256color
22:21  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: does it work with another terminal like xterm?
22:23  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: i'm afraid not. It seems its some configuration problem. Not a terminal problem
22:24  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: maybe you have to get your $TERM right, mine says xterm-256color
22:24  kongo: but I am no expert on gnome terminal
22:24  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: in which?
22:25  ChrisBuchholz: oh sorry
22:25  ChrisBuchholz: it says xterm-256color? Also in screen (if you use screen)?
22:26  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: no, outside of screen
22:26  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: I don't know if that matters
22:27  ChrisBuchholz: well, the guys at #screen sounded like it did
22:27  ChrisBuchholz: mine, when not in screen, says xterm - not xterm-256color
22:27  kongo: then I would try to change that as well
22:28  ChrisBuchholz: if i knew how :P
22:29  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: would you mind telling me how?
22:29  kongo: I have got xterm*termName: xterm-256color in my .Xdefaults
22:30  kongo: I don't know whether that's the best way of doing it, but it works
22:31  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: should that file already exist, or?
22:32  kongo: in doubt, create it :) maybe you have .Xresources or some other
22:33  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: i have .Xsession
22:34  ChrisBuchholz: .Xsession-error*
22:34  ChrisBuchholz: but that is it :P
22:35  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: that doesnt do anything either
22:38  kongo: ChrisBuchholz: then I really got no idea anymore where the problem is
22:40  ManDay: I don't even manage to do the first, I thought wrapmargin would do but it does nothing for me
22:40  ChrisBuchholz: kongo: yeah, i get that from lots of people :D
22:40  ManDay: domidimi: by soft wrap i mean not materialize the wraps as linebreaks in the buffer
22:42  rson: ChrisBuchholz: outside of screen, run TERM=xterm-256color vim
22:42  picasso: good day #vim
22:42  rson: ChrisBuchholz: then in screen run TERM=screen-256color-bce vim
22:42  picasso: i'm curious about some strange behavior using MiniBufExpl alongside NERDTree
22:42  rson: ChrisBuchholz: do you get the same result with those two?
22:43  picasso: say i have NERDTree open in its default position (left vertical window) and several buffers open, so MiniBufExpl has a small horizontal pane at the top of the right vertical pane
22:44  picasso: if i want to close the active buffer, i do :bd
22:44  picasso: but then that window goes away, leaving NERDTree to take up the whole screen
22:44  picasso: then when i use NERDTree to open a new file, the window it creates is only one column wide and needs to be resized
22:44  picasso: is there a command i can use to close the active buffer without closing a window?
22:45  ChrisBuchholz: rson: nope - colorscheme difference as always
22:46  rson: ChrisBuchholz: the correct colors are showing up outside of screen, correct?
22:46  ChrisBuchholz: rson: yes
22:46  ChrisBuchholz: rson: they always do
22:47  picasso: i win with google http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Deleting_a_buffer_without_closing_the_window
22:47  ChrisBuchholz: rson: also when i ran that command you gave
22:47  rson: ChrisBuchholz: can you post your screenrc?
22:47  rson: sorry if i missed it somewhere
22:47  ChrisBuchholz: rson: sure!
22:48  rson: ChrisBuchholz: also be sure a proper screen termcap is installed. (on my system it's in /usr/share/terminfo/s/screen*
22:49  ChrisBuchholz: rson: except for the last line, it is as it came bundled http://gist.github.com/633029
22:50  ChrisBuchholz: rson: i dunno what that is. Will look into it :P
22:50  rson: ChrisBuchholz: it should come with screen, it defines the capabilities of screen as a terminal
22:51  rson: ChrisBuchholz: can you try something really quick for me? add two lines to the bottom of your screenrc
22:51  ChrisBuchholz: rson: yeah, sure :P
22:51  ChrisBuchholz: rson: everything that might put a light on the problem
22:52  rson: ChrisBuchholz: defbce on and "term screen-256color-bce"
22:52  rson: "defbce on" *
22:54  ChrisBuchholz: rson: didnt help, i'm afraid :/
22:55  ChrisBuchholz: rson: $TERM is now screen-256color-bce, btw
22:55  rson: ChrisBuchholz: unfortunately I'm on windows right now so I can't screw around with it much, but I'd look into the termcaps thing.  For reference, my screenrc is here and it works great for me (you'll want to remove the backtick commands): http://github.com/rson/dotfiles/blob/master/screenrc
22:55  rson: ChrisBuchholz: yeah, that's what the second line does
22:56  ChrisBuchholz: rson: yeah, just so you knew it 'was on' ;(
22:56  ChrisBuchholz: ;) *
22:56  rson: what distro btw?
22:57  ChrisBuchholz: ubuntu 10.10
22:58  rson: interesting.  i just installed a ubuntu box yesterday.  let me go fire it up and see if it Just Works.
22:58  ChrisBuchholz: rson: holy smolly - your website reminds me of ... well, mine :D
22:58  rson: ?
22:58  jajmon: hello good sirs!
22:58 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
22:58  ChrisBuchholz: http://chrisbuchholz.name :P
22:59  ChrisBuchholz: rson: cool. I rather hope it doesnt, because then it means my box is broken :P
22:59  jajmon: ive just installed NERD Commenter and im trying to map its toggle comment thingie on ",cc", and it kind of works.. but after the current line have been toggled it enters insert mode..
22:59  rson: ChrisBuchholz: well considering you "design interfaces" i'm glad mine reminds you of yours :)
22:59  jajmon: i have map ,cc <plug>NERDCommenterToggleComment
23:00  jajmon: and let mapleader = ","
23:00  jajmon: i got it working on my work computer earlier today.. but now i cant figure out why it doesnt work at home
23:02  ChrisBuchholz: rson: yeah.. Maybe i should write some more articles instead of design interfaces. That might do some for my geekfacter 0_?
23:02  rson: ChrisBuchholz: :)
23:04  rson: ChrisBuchholz: i just did some tests on a brand new u10.10 install.  by default gnome-terminal uses TERM=xterm and my colors don't work.  using TERM=xterm256-color, they work.  In screen the default TERM=screen, colors don't work.  TERM=screen-256color-bce colors work.  Check my vimrc for how I set my colorscheme, you might be able to tweak that to get what you want.  Not sure why it's not working for you.  (btw that's without a .screenrc, us
23:05  rson: jajmon: if your mapleader=',' then you should map <Leader>cc to the nerdtree toggle
23:06  rson: nerdcomment*
23:07  rson: jajmon: map <Leader>c <plug>NERDCommenterToggle <- is what i have in my vimrc
23:07 --- pattern_ is now known as pattern
23:07  fow: The git version of NERD commenter uses leader by default, for what it's worth
23:09  ChrisBuchholz: rson: did it Just Work, the ubuntu box?
23:10  rson: no, i had to manually set TERM, but that could be done with one screen config change.  so in essence, it worked, but not instantly.  i got further than you did.
23:11  ChrisBuchholz: rson: hell...
23:11  rson: ChrisBuchholz: and i literally installed that sunday morning
23:12  ChrisBuchholz: rson: yeah, i know - it sucks
23:12  ChrisBuchholz: ... for me, that is :D
23:16 --- jajmon_ is now known as jajmon
23:22  Jon--: How do you use hlsearch to search for the next occurrence of the string (when it is currently highlighted on another) ?
23:23  chrisbuchholz: rson: i have 'set t_Co=256' in my .vimrc - if i remove it, the colorscheme is not right either out of screen. Its not the same as in screen, but it is no right. But even though i remove the  line from my .vimrc, it stays the same in screen. Maybe that will tell you something?
23:24  rson: chrisbuchholz: unfortunately it doesn't.  You shouldn't have to set t_Co manually, the terminal should do that for you (via terminfo)
23:24  rson: i'm wondering if something is wrong with your terminfo stuff
23:27  chrisbuchholz: rson: it might be
23:27  KeeperOfTheSoul: is there a plugin or something to highlight conflict markers and jump between them?
23:28  KeeperOfTheSoul: possibly even to show the 3 sections in different windows?
23:29  jajmon: rson, yes of course. thank you. still vim enters insert mode after i type in ",cc" though.. :-/
23:30  jajmon: nvm
23:30  rson: jajmon: fix it?
23:30  jajmon: forgot to source _vimrc
23:31  jajmon: yes
23:31  jajmon: now it works :-)
23:31  jajmon: thanks to your great help
23:31  rson: heh, glad it works.
23:31  jajmon: :)
23:31  jajmon: weee, nerd commenter rulez
23:32  jajmon: now i can comment stuff really fast :D
23:32  jajmon: and spend more time programming >:D
23:32  chrisbuchholz: rson: do you know how i can find out about if its my terminfo that bugs?
23:33  rson: chrisbuchholz: I honestly don't know.  my best guess would be to reinstall gnome-terminal and see if it fixes it.  unfortunately I highly doubt it will.
23:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: bah, apparently dit doesn't like nested <> inside a html tag
23:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: anyway to fix that?
23:33  KeeperOfTheSoul: 7.3 btw
23:34  chrisbuchholz: rson: damn ...
23:36  KeeperOfTheSoul: also, anyway to have delete also use the numbered registers? or anyway to delete a motion followed by a paste without altering " ?
23:42  chrisbuchholz: rson: i dont even have an idea of where to go look for other solutions or people with them
23:44  rson: chrisbuchholz: i'd say shoot a message out to the vim_use list and see if someone has a solution.  I'd include all the information you can including distro, terminal, TERM both in screen and out of screen and explain that the colors don't work as expected in either unless you set t_Co manually.  It may be something simple, but i've never run into it.
23:45  rson: chrisbuchholz: maybe someone in #ubuntu may know, i dunno how technical that channel is nowadays though
23:45  chrisbuchholz: hmm, yeah, okay, thank you rson ;)
23:46  rson: np, hopefully you get it figured out
