20:24  emes: I'm on a system with vim 6.4 installed, copied over my .vimrc and .vim that I normally use, but it doesn't seem to do much. I'm not a vim guru. I get behavior like backspace not working, no color. how much doesn't vim 6.4 support?
20:25  spiiph: It should support the 'backspace' option, and syntax highlighting.

21:34  ezzieyguywuf: cam vim perform math, i.e. multiply every number selected in visual mode by -1?
21:47  xtagon: I don't know if vim can do the math itself, but you could write a script to do it and use   :help :!
21:48  DHulme: or if you just want to insert - in front of every number you can do that easily with :s
21:49  peth: ezzieyguywuf: '<,'>s/\d\+/\=submatch(0)*-1/g
21:50  ezzieyguywuf: peth: woah, I'll have to try that
21:50  ezzieyguywuf: what I'm doing now is trying to change all - to #, then all space to -, then all # to space
21:51  ezzieyguywuf: but when I visually select a colomn and a a search-replace, it applies to the whole line, not just tho column.
21:51  DHulme: that's a good way of doing it
21:51  jamessan: ezzieyguywuf: :help /\%V
21:51  DHulme: peth's solution won't work for negative numbers anyway
21:52  ezzieyguywuf: jamessan: word I'll try that
21:53  Quibus: Hi all
21:53  peth: DHulme: ok, add -* then
21:53  Quibus: I wondered what spelling dictionaries are used in VIM, so I know which package to install to get support for Dutch
21:54  peth: anyway, i'm not saying that's the best solution
21:56  jamessan: Quibus: Vim will fetch the proper dictionaries for you.  ":set spell spelllang=..."
21:58  Quibus: jamessan: great, that works perfectly, indeed! :) I was totally unaware of this option. THANKS!
22:01  Quibus: see you later

23:16  agenteo: hi, can I check the vim version from a script? I used if version >= 730 set relative number endif but it seems like it never gets used
23:16  rson: v:version
23:17  rson: and it's 703
23:18  agenteo: thanks rson
23:20  DHulme: and don't use the version for that, use has()
23:22  agenteo: ... never heard of that. How would you code the if statement using that? if has('relativenumber')?
23:23  DHulme: see :help has()
23:30  agenteo: no luck finding relative number in the featurelist
