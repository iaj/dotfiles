00:15  oxman: what does mean `leader`ig ?
00:15  mgedmin: traditionally it's spelled <leader>something
00:15  mgedmin: and it means a mapping that begins with a customizable "leader" sequence
00:15  oxman: how can i use it ?
00:15  mgedmin: which is \ by default
00:16  oxman: ok thanks
00:16  mgedmin: but you can change it to something else if you prefer something else
00:16  mgedmin: :h leader has more info
00:19  oxman: thanks :)
00:19  oxman: how can I auto call a function at vim start ?
00:19  spiiph: :h VimENter
00:19  spiiph: bah
00:19  spiiph: :h VimEnter
00:19  oxman: call IndentGuidesToggle() don't work
00:19  oxman: I don't think i need to handle the event
00:20  oxman: I only need to put the correct syntax to call a function in my vimrc
00:21  spiiph: That is the correct syntax.
00:21  spiiph: But your function isn't loaded yet.
00:22  oxman: indeed sorry
00:22  oxman: thanks
00:31  apocalyptiq: hi! i've just ran vimtutor, i'm trying to learn using it, i want to use it to programming in rails
00:31  apocalyptiq: but there is one thing that is missing in vim - a files tree, is there any such as plugin?
00:34  lamdk`: NERDTree!
00:34  solars: heh
00:35  solars: apocalyptiq, with rails.vim you rarely need a files list
00:35  apocalyptiq: but rails.vim seem doesn't work for me
00:35  apocalyptiq: i've copied it to .vim/plugins, but for example :Rails smth doesn't works
00:37  malesca: apocalyptiq: Did you restart vim after installing the plugin?
00:37  apocalyptiq: yes
00:41  jeffszusz: if anyone wants to earn some rep on StackOverflow and help someone out, there's a question you might be able to answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4764741/how-to-align-text it's way over my head :(
00:43  spiiph: Tabular.vim can probably handle it.
00:44  spiiph: I'm sure Align can too
00:45  apocalyptiq: oh, rails.vim works now
