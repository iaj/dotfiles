13:38  mklappstuhl: how can i surround a line with a character
13:38  mklappstuhl: so that the line starts and ends with that character
13:40  the_isz: mklappstuhl: :s/.*/,\&,/
13:40  the_isz: mklappstuhl: replace , with what character you want
13:43  mklappstuhl: thank you
13:45  mklappstuhl: the that replaces the content of the line with & – whats the textobject for a line
13:45  FernandoBasso: What about :%s/$\|^/some_char/g ?
13:46  strull: what about I"<esc>A<C-A> ?
13:47  mklappstuhl: FernandoBasso: thought about it but that would also remove the linebreaks i think
13:48  mklappstuhl: FernandoBasso: no it works..
13:50  FernandoBasso: What about qz I some_char <Esc> A some_char <Esc> j q [count]@z ?
13:50  FernandoBasso: Oh...
13:54  mklappstuhl: that would work too of course...
13:56  mklappstuhl: another question: gedit has an option to display tabs(arrow) and spaces(·) as characters, is that possible in vim? i only found solutions that show line endings etc
13:56  mklappstuhl: (it's useful when you edit markdown)
13:56  mklappstuhl: especially the spaces part
13:57  mgedmin: for tabs, you can :set list listchars=>-
13:57  mgedmin: possibly with nicer unicode characters in place of > and -
13:57  mgedmin: for spaces, maybe vim 7's new conceal feature could help
13:58  mgedmin: actually, the only place where I want to see spaces is trailing spaces
13:58  mgedmin: and for that, :set listchars=tab:>-,trail:.
13:58  mgedmin: (incidentally, my first suggestion was in error: I'd omitted the tab: in front of >- in set listchars)
13:58  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: does this show all spaces at the end of a line?
13:58  mgedmin: yes
14:00  mklappstuhl: that looks pretty solid
14:00  mgedmin: hack with conceal: syn match Space " " conceal cchar=·
14:01  mgedmin: and :set conceallevel=1 concealcursor=nvic
14:02  mgedmin: I wouldn't use it, myself
14:11  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: it's also okay for me to only see all trailing spaces...
14:12  mklappstuhl: have you any special chars in mind for tab? i tried some but they didnt work apparently
14:13  FernandoBasso: I'll dedicate sometime to figure out a way to use the conceal feature to completely hide comments.
14:13  mklappstuhl: (not displayed or - after 2 tabs)
14:13  mgedmin: I'm happy with >- myself
14:16  mgedmin: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_unwanted_spaces#Using_the_list_and_listchars_options has some examples
14:17  jink: I use →_ and ·
14:18 --- silex is now known as Silex
14:18  mklappstuhl: ⇢  and a space would be nice
14:19  mgedmin: just remember to escape the space with a \
14:19  mklappstuhl: oh :P
14:19  mgedmin: i.e. set lcs=tab:⇢\
14:19  mgedmin: looks like a smiley ;)
14:20  jink: mklappstuhl: It would be, but my PuTTY doesn't render that (becomes a square).
14:20  mklappstuhl: the arrow is only shown when i press tab twice.. is that the intended behaviour?
14:21  jink: Well, PuTTY renders it, but the font doesn't support it. :)
14:21  mklappstuhl: putty sounds like windows - sorry :P
14:21  jink: :>
14:21  jink: I PuTTY to Ubuntu.
14:22  mklappstuhl: then at least a half is okay :P
14:23  mklappstuhl: i want that character shown for every tab... not only for every second ... is that possible?
14:23  mgedmin: mklappstuhl, it is shown for every tab character in the file
14:23  mgedmin: there's an option, softtabstop, which makes <tab> insert spaces/tabs as appropriate
14:23  mgedmin: to emulate 4-space-wide tabs
14:24  mklappstuhl: when i press tab and then type something nothing is shown
14:24  mgedmin: because God Almighty decreed that ASCII TAB is 8-characters wide period
14:24  KeeperOfTheSoul: can I select a match?
14:24  mgedmin: so it sounds as if you've got tabstop=8 and softtabstop=4 and noexpandtab
14:24  KeeperOfTheSoul: eg, if I've just done /something can I then tell it to select the current match?
14:25  mgedmin: to get what you want you'd need to set tabstop=4, and my fingers bleed just by mentioning that heresy
14:25  mklappstuhl: i have noexpandtab and smarttab
14:25  mgedmin: hm, I don't remember what smarttab does
14:25  mgedmin: probably uses 'shiftwidth' spaces at the beginning of the line, converting to hard tabs as appropriate
14:26  mgedmin: personally, I'd recommend :set expandtab and avoiding ASCII TAB characters in your files
14:26  mgedmin: unless you're editing Makefiles
14:26  mgedmin: hard tabs just cause problems
14:26  KeeperOfTheSoul: ah, never mind, //e right?
14:27  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: tabs vs spaces? :D i never got why i should use spaces instead of tabs
14:28  linduxed: was there a key for repeating the latest macro?
14:28  mklappstuhl: .
14:28  FernandoBasso: @@
14:28  darkredandyellow: guys, I can't get nerdcommenter to work: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218
14:28  mklappstuhl: ah . is repeat command and @@ is the :macro?
14:29  linduxed: thx
14:29  mklappstuhl: darkredandyellow: whats the problem
14:29  darkredandyellow: NERD_commenter.vim is in my plugin dir, but when I hit ",cc" in a, say, ruby the line just gets deleted
14:29  mgedmin: basically, tabs vs spaces boil down to: "are they 4- or 8- chars wide?  does everyone on your team agree?  are they all very careful not to mix spaces and tabs? do lines fit in under 80-columns even when you switch from ts=4 to ts=8?"
14:29  darkredandyellow: mklappstuhl, see my addendum
14:31  mklappstuhl: darkredandyellow: works for me... maybe you have something in your vimrc that causes this
14:32  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: but from what i see day to day most people use tabs ?!
14:32  mgedmin: from what *I* see most people use spaces
14:32 * mgedmin shrugs
14:33  FernandoBasso: I use spaces.
14:33  darkredandyellow: mklappstuhl, I'm not sure where I possibly could have borked that: http://github.com/dark-red-and-yellow/dot/blob/master/.vimrc
14:33  darkredandyellow: looks ok to me
14:34  mklappstuhl: darkredandyellow: to me too
14:34  Atlantic777: Hi! How can I sort splitted windows? Move a viewport to the left or so.
14:35  darkredandyellow: mklappstuhl, I mean the docs say: ,cc |NERDComComment| Comments out the current line or text selected in visual mode.
14:35  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: its annoying that we actually have to care about shit like this :D
14:35  mgedmin: yeah
14:35  darkredandyellow: but when i hit "," followed by a "c" followed by a "c" the line gets deleted
14:35  mklappstuhl: darkredandyellow: i know, tried it myself a minute ago
14:36  darkredandyellow: even when I remove the vimrc
14:36  darkredandyellow: hmm
14:36  mklappstuhl: oh
14:36  darkredandyellow: strange
14:36  mklappstuhl: i kow
14:36  mklappstuhl: you have to map your leader to ,
14:36  mgedmin: or use \c
14:36  darkredandyellow: mklappstuhl, sorry but I not sure what you mean by "your leader"?
14:36  mgedmin: since \ is the default <Leader>
14:36  mklappstuhl: let mapleader = ","
14:37  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: or that way right
14:37  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: but , feels better :P
14:37  darkredandyellow: ahhhhhh
14:37  darkredandyellow: thanks, that's working!
14:37  mgedmin: actually, I prefer , too, but I hate random plugins just mapping random <Leader> combinations that stomp all over my bindings
14:37  NCS_One: Atlantic777: try :h window-moving
14:38  mgedmin: so I keep <Leader> as the default \ and reserve , for my own custom mappings
14:38  darkredandyellow: alright, mklappstuhl thanks for the assist
14:38  estragib: so what do you , remappers use for repeat last tTfF?
14:38  mklappstuhl: mgedmin: i dont use much own mappings by now so that'd be overhead
14:38  mklappstuhl: darkredandyellow: you're welcome
14:38  mgedmin: estragib, , followed by a 0.5 second pause
14:39  mgedmin: or we repeat the same tTfF
14:39  Atlantic777: Thanks NCS_One, it's CTRL + x :)
14:39  estragib: makes sense :)
14:39  Atlantic777: ctrl + w x
14:40  NCS_One: Atlantic777: yes
14:46  mklappstuhl: does any one else know how i could display a listchar for *every* tab?
14:48  Hates_: spaces FTW
14:48  mklappstuhl: :D
14:48  mklappstuhl: i don't see the reason but i'm tolerant so *SHUT UP* :D
14:48  the_isz: mklappstuhl: well, with my default settings i just do  :set list  and am shown a  ^I  for each tab...
14:49  Hates_: I have this in my .vimrc https://gist.github.com/640f27606c34d50867e3
14:50  mklappstuhl: Hates_: but the triangle will only be displayed if you hit tab twice, or not?
14:51  Atlantic777: What would be good pop3/imap mail checker for vim? I'm going to use it with gmail.
14:51  the_isz: mklappstuhl: see  :help lcs
14:51  rson: mklappstuhl: the list character for tab is shown once for each literal tab.
14:51  Hates_: mklappstuhl: no idea. I'd tell you but I have tab bound to autocomplete
14:54  Silex: does any of you uses vim as an irc client?
14:56  the_isz: Atlantic777: if you're looking for an email client _inside_ vim, check out emacs, i hear it's quite the operating system. maybe you can even start vim from it ;) otherwise, i really like mutt, which you can configure to use vim as a text editor
14:57  mklappstuhl: the_isz: good answer :D
14:57  the_isz: mklappstuhl: thanks^^
14:57  Atlantic777: the_isz, umm I don't like emacs because of editing shortcuts, but running vim inside it would be really nice! :D I just need some notification when a get new mail on pop3 or imap. :D
14:58  Atlantic777: when I get*
14:58  lucasoman: i like VimOS
14:58  lucasoman: it's very configurable
14:59  lucasoman: and unlike EmacsOS, my hands don't have to be little gymnasts
14:59  the_isz: Atlantic777: personally, i show my unread mails inside my window manager, but there surely are many ways to make you aware of incoming email other than misusing your editor for that. i may be wrong, though!
14:59  rson: i use screen
14:59  rson: i suppose i should qualify that.. i use screen to tell me when i have new email
15:00 * bnovc uses a mail client
15:00  mklappstuhl: the_isz: there are strangely to help entries for lcs but i knew what you were talking of...
15:01  mklappstuhl: rson: what do you mean with 'literal tab'
15:01  mklappstuhl: rson: you should check out tmux if you aren't already aware of it
15:01  lucasoman: rson: how?

15:02  Nahra: what's wrong when getting "_arguments:448: _vim_files: function definition file not found" ?
15:02  the_isz: mklappstuhl: i didn't understand the last sentence you said to me. maybe say it in german?
15:02  the_isz: mklappstuhl: or reformulate?
15:03  rson: mklappstuhl: i don't like it for many reasons.
15:03  rson: mklappstuhl: a tab character.
15:03  rson: lucasoman: a script that runs and outputs a count in my hardstatus line
15:04  lucasoman: rson: ah ok, that makes sense
15:04  rson: the_isz: i think he means :help lcs vs :help 'lcs'
15:04  mklappstuhl: rson: but when i hit tab – isnt that a tab character?
15:05  rson: mklappstuhl: that depends on your settings of expandtab and softtabstop
15:05  mklappstuhl: rson: the_isz exactly
15:07  rson: mklappstuhl: for instance, :set list noet ts=8 sts=4
15:07  rson: mklappstuhl: then hit tab once, you get 4 spaces, hit tab twice you get a tab character, hit tab three times you get a tab and 4 spaces, hit tab 4 times you get two tab characters
15:11  mklappstuhl: rson: that helped me to unterstand thanks
15:11  mklappstuhl: i now set ts to 4
15:12  carlesso: Hi all! I'm not able to install NERD_commenter
15:13  mklappstuhl: carlesso: install or use?

15:15  carlesso: and also I've my bundle directory with pathogen, and downloaded the git in ~/.vim/bundle
15:15  carlesso: even putting NERD_commander.vim in ~/.vim/autoload dows not work
15:15  mklappstuhl: do you have something like 'set noloadplugins' in your vimrc?
15:15  carlesso: not at all
15:16  rson: carlesso: when you say it's not loaded, what do you mean? it's not in :scriptnames or it just isn't working?
15:16  carlesso: hum, it's present in :scriptnames
15:16  carlesso: but it's not working
15:16  rson: carlesso: how are you determining it's not working? the keybinds?
15:16  carlesso: yes
15:17  mklappstuhl: ^^
15:17  rson: what keybind are you trying?
15:17  carlesso: ,cc does not work
15:17  mklappstuhl: try \cc
15:17  rson: try \cc
15:17  carlesso: oh god
15:17  carlesso: why?
15:17  rson: they are mapped to <leader>
15:17  lucasoman: lol
15:17  rson: default leader is \
15:17 * mklappstuhl is faster
15:17  carlesso: thanks a lotd
15:17  rson: mklappstuhl: i knew the problem from the start ;)
15:17  carlesso: I was going mad
15:17  carlesso: :D
15:18  mklappstuhl: same here :D but when he said it's not loaded I tried to believe in the first moment :D
15:18  carlesso: really thanks guys
15:18  rson: carlesso: np
15:18  rson: mklappstuhl: :)
15:18  mklappstuhl: there was somebody with exactly the same problem 20minutes ago or so :D
15:25  bosie: i just started with vim, so forgive me if this seems dumb but isn't vim in normal mode kind of inconsistent? JK are supposed to move up/down one line and gm puts you in the middle of a line. exept it doesn't. if you have a wrapped line jk behaves as it should be, gm puts you in the middle of ... nothing
15:27  strull: bosie: :he gm tells another story
15:27  bosie: strull: i take it back than
15:28  bosie: guess the tutorial/cheat sheet meant line literal then
15:28  carlesso: How can I go back to nerd_tree tree from editing window?
15:28  bosie: carlesso: you could toggle it
15:29  mklappstuhl: carlesso: <C-w> w?
15:29  bosie: carlesso: :NERDTreeToggle
15:29  mklappstuhl: or toggle right
15:29 * mgedmin curses :diffoff again
15:30  carlesso: thaks, unable to find because :tabnext not working
15:35  bosie: how does one actually search in a directory for a pattern and not just in a single file?
15:35  lucasoman: you can use vimgrep
15:36  Dynetrekk: bosie: ...or just grep? :)
15:36  lucasoman: but the qf list is so nifty!
15:37  bosie: i tried grep but it doesn't really provide an interactive list, does it?
15:37  mgedmin: while :grep does
15:37  bosie: it just shows the occurences but i can't really seslect them
15:38  bosie: hm
15:38  mgedmin: :cw
15:38  mgedmin: move up/down, press <enter>
15:38  mgedmin: or use :cn
15:39  bosie: that is with ok
15:39  bosie: ok
15:49  Rockj: Q:   I have a file with some stupid encoding which I want to do some search and replace in vim with.    Ã<86> being Æ and Ã<98> being Ø etc. Problem is that it seems the <86> is some kind of control code? so I dont know how to make it match in :%s/Ã<86>/Æ/g . Anyone could assist me and teach me ? :-)
15:50  strull: Rockj: /\%x86
15:52  Rockj: does %x represents some kind of control code I guess? gotto google that when Im home today. Thanks strull.

16:32  withanx: anyone know of a plugin to get textmate style word completion in-document?  If you start typing foob- then press escape in textmate, it will search the document for words that start with foob and autocomplete, pressing escape again cycles through the possibilities
16:33  rson: withanx: ctrl-p
16:33  Raimondi: <C-X><C-P>

16:51  Scala: My listchars: set listchars=tab:»\ ,trail:·
16:51  Scala: I have expandtab turned on when I'm editing python, can I have it show a >> for 4 spaces at the beginning of a line?
16:54  graywh: nope
17:01  Scala: graywh: bummer :(
17:03  graywh: you could edit your python files with tabs and save them with spaces
17:05  mgedmin: actually, I think you may be able to craft something up using vim's new conceal feature
17:06  mgedmin: have you seen http://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python ?
17:08  mgedmin: so, a syntax rule that matches a single space at the beginning of a line, provided that it is followed by three more spaces, and is concealed behind a » character ...
17:10  FernandoBasso: Do you guys think it is a good idea/practice to set autochdir?
17:10  graywh: but you need it to "eat" the remaining spaces for when you indent 2 or more levels
17:12  mgedmin: FernandoBasso, I recall trying it and deciding it was a Bad Idea, but I don't remember why
17:14  FernandoBasso: mgedmin: Sometimes it helps me, sometimes it does exactly the oposit of (which I don't know how to say, hehe).
17:15  mgedmin: "that"
17:15  FernandoBasso: Like, 'it gets on my way'.
17:16  mgedmin: this mapping: map             ,E              :e <C-R>=substitute(expand("%:h"), '.\zs$', '/', '')<CR>
17:16  mgedmin: removed most of my need for 'autochdir'
17:16  FernandoBasso: I assume , is your leader.
17:17  mgedmin: actually, no
17:17  mgedmin: I want to have a separate namespace, so to speak, for my own mappings
17:17  mgedmin: one that doesn't conflict with random new plugins I decide to try out
17:25  iaj: mgedmin: I just tried that mapping.. can I somehow remove the needed, >tab< to make it expand?
17:25  mgedmin: expand?
17:25  Silex: what does that mapping do?
17:26  mgedmin: lets you open other files in the same directory easily
17:26  cYmen: Is it somehow possible to replace a selected area with one character which is in a reg? So C-r "insert"?
17:26  Silex: okay... so if I already use FuzzyFinder I guess it's not really for me
17:26  iaj: mgedmin: well I see the whole substitute thing at the commandline at first
17:26  mgedmin: iaj, weird!
17:27  iaj: mgedmin: so you see the path directly?
17:28  mgedmin: yes
17:29  Raimondi: Try with:   noremap <expr>,E ":e ".substitute(expand("%:h"), '.\zs$', '/', '')
17:29  mgedmin: neat idea
17:30  mgedmin: I think you need a space after <expr>, no?
17:30  iaj: wise choice, thanks Raimondi that worked out
17:30  mgedmin: apparently not
17:30  Raimondi: No need, but it looks better :)
17:30  Raimondi: I usually separate <expr> and <buffer> from the rest.
17:32  mgedmin: and the substitute() appears to be unnecessary
17:32  mgedmin: map <expr> ,E ":e ".expand("%:h")."/"
17:32  mgedmin: works for me
17:33  mgedmin: I remember starting with just expand("%:h")."/" and it not working for me in some circumstances ...
17:33  mgedmin: ah, if you start 'vim' with no filename
17:33  mgedmin: then ,E ends up as :e /, which is not what I would expect
17:35  Raimondi: mgedmin: YOu can use expand('%:h') == '' ? getcwd().'/' : expand('%:h').'/'
17:35  Raimondi: Or something that works for your case.
17:36  NevroPus: Hi. How can I set cpp syntax highlighting for files with the ending .tmpl?

17:37  FernandoBasso: That mapping is really useful.

17:58  fismoll8: hello everyone. I am trying to run a command from a shell within vim, but am getting the error: /bin/bash: pdflatex not found. This is odd, as I can run the command fine from terminal (i.e. I have the correct path set up in my bashrc). What is going on?
17:59  graywh: bashrc is no the right place to set $PATH
17:59  graywh: *not
17:59  LeoNerd: Do you really mean "from a shell within vim"...?
18:01  fismoll8: LeoNerd:  I mean, using the !which pdflatex command gives me a blank line in return from vim
18:02  fismoll8: graywh:  I also have a .profile that sources bashrc
18:02  graywh: that's really wrong
18:02  fismoll8: graywh:  howso? I found this info online...could very well be wrong
18:03  fismoll8: graywh:  what do you suggest...I thought .profile was for login-shells, and bashrc was for non-login shells
18:03  graywh: but something other than bash might load .profile
18:04  fismoll8: graywh:  I moved .profile to .bash_profile; no luck
18:04  fismoll8: graywh:  but I see what you're saying; you are right
18:05  mgedmin: e.g. on ubuntu /etc/gdm/Xsession sources ~/.profile
18:05  mgedmin: and it uses /bin/sh, which is dash
18:05  fismoll8: well, even with .bashrc and .bash_profile now, vim has an empty PATH variable
18:06  fismoll8: I can only run default system commands using !, like !ls, for example
18:07  fismoll8: :!echo $PATH  gives /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin
18:07  mgedmin: ~/.profile is the right place to modify your PATH
18:08  mgedmin: how are you starting your vim, and which desktop environment do you use?
18:08  fismoll8: in short, it is missing a swath of locations that I have added in my bashrc
18:08  fismoll8: mgedmin:  I use macosx, so aqua
18:08  mgedmin: oooh, mac os
18:08 * mgedmin has no clue
18:08  graywh: yeah, os x doesn't do things like a normal *nix
18:08  fismoll8: yup, never had this problem in freebsd or debian
18:10  graywh: you can edit the system-wide path by adding items to /etc/paths or /etc/paths.d/anything
18:11  graywh: and changes to .profile won't normally take effect until log out and back in
18:13  fismoll8: thanks for the help everyone
18:16  iratik: How can I select a column of text visually then send it to a new buffer?
18:16  FernandoBasso: iratik: Copy it and paste in the other buffer.
18:17  iratik: Visual block mode seems to be stuck on selecting lines
18:17  FernandoBasso: iratik: Ctrl-v for a block-wise selection.
18:17  FernandoBasso: v is character-wise, V is line-wise and Ctrl-v is block-wise.
18:17  iratik: There it is... I should be able to figure out the rest from here
18:18  iratik: Thanks :D
18:18  FernandoBasso: :)
18:21  Altreus: How can I get two buffers to scroll together after I've used :diffthis on them
18:21  Altreus: ?
18:22  Altreus: oh!
18:22  mgedmin: set scrollbind in both of them
18:22  Altreus: I just found it :)
18:23  Altreus: hm the docs say :diffthis sets the options like for 'vimdiff', but I was pretty sure that was one of them

18:48 * FernandoBasso scratches his head.
18:48  graywh: entered with Q
18:48  dauerbaustelle: yes it is!
18:49  dauerbaustelle: "enter visual to go to normal mode" *facepalm*
18:49  rson: ...
18:49  rson: :)
18:49  graywh: and fyi normal mode == command mode
18:49  graywh: Ex mode is like continuous command-line mode
18:49  rson: that's what he said originally
18:50  graywh: he said command, not command-line
18:51  rson: misread what you said, i've always called command-line mode command mode as well.  good to know i'm wrong.
18:51  graywh: it's an easy mistake
18:51  graywh: and usually it's not hard to decipher what others mean
18:52  dauerbaustelle: so why are there two expressions for 'normal mode'? :)
18:54  dauerbaustelle: wait, does that mean 'normal mode' and 'command mode' may be used synonymously in the vim docs?
18:57  graywh: i see 12 instances of "normal mode" and 8 of "command mode"
18:58  dauerbaustelle: so the answer is 'yes'.
18:58  dauerbaustelle: good to know :)

19:07  jtaby: sjl: Yeah, I have <leader>a mapped to this
19:07  jtaby: and <leader>p mapped to peepopen
19:08  jtaby: you can put full-on perl regex's in there
19:08  sjl: jtaby: Cool, any way I could get you to send it to me?  I bought PeepOpen, don't worry :)
19:08  jtaby: umm sure
19:08  jtaby: can I PM?
19:08  sjl: yep
19:10  lucasoman: sjl, when you say you're a bassist, is that a contrabass? or a bass guitar?
19:12  sjl: lucasoman: bass guitar mainly, but I've start learning upright as well
19:12  lucasoman: nice!
19:12 * lucasoman is a violinist

19:20  sjl: halogenandtoast: :help `]
19:21  halogenandtoast: ah yeah that would work for yanked text, I'm actually pasting from the system, so I want it to go backwards to the first character of the last insert.
19:21  withanx: I like the autocomplete, but I prefer to cycle through them without the distracting pink dropdown box
19:21  halogenandtoast: so the opposite
19:21  halogenandtoast: `[
19:21  halogenandtoast: might work
19:21  sjl: Ah, yeah,
19:21  halogenandtoast: yup
19:21  halogenandtoast: sweet thanks

19:35  mgedmin: I found that in snipmate's help, IIRC
19:36  FernandoBasso: mgedmin: Thanks. I really overlooked it. Thanks. I'm going to read it again.
19:36  FernandoBasso: By the way, that worked as you said.
19:37  FernandoBasso: By the way (again), I am going crazy reading documentation everywhere for everything. I think I'm trying to learn to much in a small amount of time.
19:39  sjl: FernandoBasso: yeah, the trick is to just learn the basics, then start working. When you find yourself doing something over and over, figure out how to automate that one thing.
19:42  FernandoBasso: sjl: But, for instance, I want to really master Vim. Sometimes I think that if one just read Vim's help when needed, one will never learn things that one would never dream about.
19:42  FernandoBasso: But perhaps I'm approaching this subject of learning vim in a wrong way.
19:42  sjl: FernandoBasso: Yeah, it's just easy to get overwhelmed.  Read a bit, do some other work and use what you read.  That's the way you'll retain it.
19:43  FernandoBasso: Sure. Just read and don't use won't be of any help. You are right.
19:43  rson: hey sjl, i have an open pull request on github for gundo, i'd like to try something (whether you accept it or not) with git history and see if it screws up the pull request.  is that ok with you?
19:43  lucasoman: FernandoBasso: it's important to get the basics down first; after a while, your workflow in vim will become apparent. Then, as you read more docs, you'll notice things that can improve your established pattern.
19:43  sjl: rson: Sure
19:44  FernandoBasso: I like to summarize things I learn, and then check them after one or two days.
19:44  rson: sjl: i want to take all commits since i opened the pull request and rewrite the history so it's one single commit, see if github figures out what i did or if the pull request breaks
19:44  sjl: rson: k
19:44  rson: i won't be able to do it until tonight though, busy day at work.
19:45  sjl: K, I won't touch the request until you let me know it's good again

20:06  davidfetter: hello
20:07  davidfetter: i have a wacky problem. when i use fink's vim from terminal.app on a sftp;// file, it sets cursorline when i :w
20:07  davidfetter: any idea what might be causing this?
20:08  davidfetter: : not ; :P
20:09  davidfetter: it doesn't really mess up my life, but it's pretty puzzling. i haven't reproduced this on X or MacVim, or...
20:10  graywh: why are you even using the fink vim?
20:28  sir_lewk: I just did ':nmap * *N' so my cursor stays on the same word when I use * (I mainly use it for highlighting, then manually jump with n), is there a better way to do it that doesn't occasionally scroll up/down on me?
20:29  graywh: i doubt it
20:30  graywh: you might could have * update the / register instead
20:30  PelleTut: How can I yank from the cursor till a sign, for instance '='?
20:31  sir_lewk: graywh: ok, I'll look into that
20:31  graywh: PelleTut, include the = or not?  on the same line?
20:31  rson: sir_lewk: you could stomp on a couple of marks and do something like :nmap * mzHmx`z*N`xzt`z (untested)
20:32  PelleTut: on the same line, without =
20:32  sir_lewk: PelleTut: does yf= do what you want?
20:32  graywh: yt=
20:32  sir_lewk: rson: thanks, I'll look at that too
20:33  rson: sir_lewk: actually that can probably be shortened, but i don't have time to play with it right now, plus i don't even know that it works :P
20:33  PelleTut: yt= works perfectly, thanks

21:00  zidoh: hi, i want to "hard resize" lines to a certain length, that is, i don't want it to be based on whitespace, so it cuts on a certain length no matter if it's in the middle of a word or not
21:00  zidoh: anybody know how to do this?
21:01  estragib: zidoh: :h 'lbr
21:02  zidoh: estragib: thanks :)
21:03  estragib: welcome :)
21:07  zidoh: estragib: hmm, how would i use that to actually insert newlines at some length of the line tho? I don't just mean the visual wrapping
21:08  estragib: oh, misunderstood that. sorry.
21:10  bosie: is there something like VisualMark that is working fine/more modern like visual mark?
21:10  estragib: zidoh: you'll have to use the right combination of 'formatoptions' and 'textwidth' then
21:11  estragib: no idea if that hard-wraps at 'tw though
21:11  zidoh: hmm
21:11  zidoh: maybe i should just write a small script to do it for me.. it's just a certain amount of text i need to "resize" :P
21:12  estragib: i'd try to do that with sed, as most everything else. :)
21:14  zidoh: i should learn sed :P
21:15  DHulme: nah, don't bother
21:15  zidoh: but i think i'll manage this with python :P
21:15  DHulme: Perl obsoleted it years ago
21:15  zidoh: Perl? :/
21:15  zidoh: not gonna have that discussion, especially here, but.. yeah :P
21:15  DHulme: one of Perl's original design goals was to be a sed replacement
21:15  DHulme: a faster, easier-to-use sed replacement
21:16  zidoh: well, the oneliners are decent enough, but i've only used it for regex substitutions etc

21:21  cubuanic: could you explain why?
21:21  graywh: vimgor, doesn't work
21:21  vimgor: What happened? Did it fall asleep on your couch? Eat your homework? Destroy your hard drive? Be specific.
21:22  graywh: i think you want :imap
21:22  cubuanic: btw, same abbreviation works fine if i enter "so,e text !D " (with space at the ned) or "sometext !D" + ESC
21:22  cubuanic: vim version is 7.2
21:23  cubuanic: any thoughts?
21:24  graywh: oh, that's matter of how abbrevs are triggered
21:26  graywh: it triggers after <CR> for me in 7.3
21:26  strull: cubuanic: what gives :imap <cr> ?
21:26  graywh: and 7.2.330
21:27  cubuanic: strull: i  <CR>        * <C-R>=<SNR>17_SelectCompletion()<CR>
21:27  strull: that may be the culprit then
21:27  cubuanic: could you explain, please
21:27  cubuanic: i'm not so familiar with this
21:28  strull: this mapping may disturb the iab triggering.
21:28  strull: why do you have it?
21:28  graywh: it does
21:28  strull: check with :verbose imap <cr> where it is defined
21:28  cubuanic: not sure. anyway, it's here not because of me
21:29  cubuanic: i'm using standart vim from debian lenny
21:29  nvictor: ok

21:29  strull: with some plugins, i guess
21:29  cubuanic: may be, it was defined somewhere in system files
21:29  graywh: it's a plugin, #17 on your brochure, i mean :scriptnames

21:49  Raimondi: It's automatically set to that value by $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/gitcommit.vim
21:49  Raimondi: dasil003: ^
21:49  graywh: dasil003, so turn on filetype plugins
21:49  dasil003: but in my .vimrc I'm overriding it
21:49  dasil003: at least I assume that's what's happening
21:49  Raimondi: :Verbose set tw?
21:50  Raimondi: all small caps
21:50  graywh: just setting 'tw' in vimrc can't override an ftplugin
21:51  dasil003: :set tw? gives me 120...
21:51  dasil003: oh is the ftplugin not a builtin?
21:51  Raimondi: dasil003:  type  :verbose set tw?
21:52  dasil003: ah I didn't get you the first time becasuse :Verbose isn't a command :)

22:12  akosch: domidimi: good point, i was hesitating because i have everything already configured in evolution
22:12  davidfetter: ...or is there some way to use MacVim inside a terminal window?
22:13  graywh: davidfetter, the mvim script that comes with macvim when you download it
22:13  davidfetter: oh
22:13  graywh: not sure how that works with the macports build
22:13  akosch: domidimi: originally i had to use evolution because of the exchange support
22:13  domidimi: akosch: davmail

I added a :unmap <c-n><c-n> to the plugin and no the line-numbers is not shown however vim still waits so it's very slow. How can I stop it from doing that?
22:44  sheepy: I'm using NERDTree, and as I prefer tabs to splits, I have figured out how to get NERDTreeMirror to run each time I open a new tab.

23:05  fow: samuelololol, you probably want an autocommand or a ftplugin if you're doing it for all C++ source files or all bash files. But for single files, maybe an autocommand or a modeline. :h autocommand :h ftplugin :h modeline
23:05  spiiph: fow, or just simply 'set foldmethod=syntax' in your .vimrc
23:05  samuelololol: fow: ty, but i just want to fold some source code, not all cpp files
23:09  withanx: doesn't seem to be working: au BufNewFile,BufRead *.dbl set filetype=dibol
23:10  spiiph: withanx, what does :filetype say?
23:11  withanx: filetype detection: on, plugin: on  indent: on
23:12  spiiph: And :set filetype? after you've loaded a .dbl file?
23:13  withanx: oh, it says dibol, just not syntax highlighting like I thought it would.
23:13  graywh: did you download or make a dibol syntax file?
23:13  graywh: b/c vim doesn't come with one
23:16  withanx: oh
23:19  foocraft: hey all
23:19  foocraft: is there a way to view a margin line at some column?
23:19  strull: foocraft: vim7.3 can do this
23:33  mcantor: I have a file with a list of names, "Lastname Firstname Middlename".  How can I add padding X to every line *AFTER* the lastname, where X is the amount of padding it takes to make every Firstname start in the same column?
23:33  mcantor: In other words, I want to prettify a bunch of columns in a text file, but the first column has an arbitrary width in each line.
23:34  graywh: mcantor, godlygeek's tabular
23:34  graywh: vimgor, tabular
23:34  vimgor: Tabular is godlygeek's plugin to align text in vim, http://github.com/godlygeek/tabular
23:34  mcantor: Thanks!
23:39  Thell: Just wanted to stop and and say thanks to all who have contributed to the vim wiki and in here, everytime I need to do something odd I find the answer.  It's great. :)
23:39 * Thell gives applause to all.
23:39 * Thell goes back to the void and to the work at hand.
23:41  spiiph: :)
23:41  spiiph: I liked that guy.
23:43  mcantor: Me too!
23:43  mcantor: The vim wiki confuses the crap out of me, though.
23:49  mcantor: I think it's the ads.
