12:30  stev3n: Raimondi: all tricks in this part of help not suitable for me
12:30  stev3n: i wan't use symbol like a Â·
12:30  stev3n: )
12:30  stev3n: but it don't work
12:31  Raimondi: scp1: Haven't tested it:  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=441
12:33  scp1: All this is great but not really what I'm after. I was figuring that vim should be able to know that, hey, tabs are used for indention here, better set aside expandtab... etc.
12:38  rudi_s: scp1: You could try that with a plugin. Vim can't do that by default, because you requirements may be different. Is one tab in the source file enough, mabye only after 10 percent are tabs, etc.
12:42  scp1: Yeah, right. Thank you.
12:45  rudi_s: np
13:07  frogonwheels: scp1: there is an indenet-guessing script out there..
14:20  spectie: hey all
14:20  spectie: does anyone use vim with gnome-terminal and write arabic letters ?
14:21  spectie: my problem is that when i try and copy/paste in the terminal, it selects the unicode characters for the forms, not the underlying letters
14:39  rdpate: what do you mean by "the unicode characters, not the underlying letters"? (I'm not familiar with arabic)
14:50  creidiki: sounds like when he pastes it, he gets the unicode charcode instead of the letter
14:50  creidiki: UxXXXX?
14:51  creidiki: oh, he's gone. ah well :D
15:28  vishesh: I have a file with ^M characters in line endings. How do I do remove them using Vim. I tried substitute but but how to print ^M? I tried to do it by pressing <CTRL>+M but it didnt work.
15:30  DHulme: see http://vim.wikia.com/File_format
15:32  OliverUv_: vishesh: you can do <ctrl>+v <ctrl>+m
15:33  OliverUv_: you can also yank the ^M, then paste it into command mode eg :%s/<ctrl-r>"//g
