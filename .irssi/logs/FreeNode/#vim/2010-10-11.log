09:22  jeffszusz: surround is interesting
09:22 --- Channel #vim was synced in 52 seconds
09:29  nkvorn: if i paste lines from the terminal, vim ads extra identation. how can i avoid that without disabling autoident?
09:30  Raimondi: nkvorn: :h 'paste'
09:31  nkvorn: Raimondi: thnx
09:31  Raimondi: np
09:32  jeffszusz: :h 'paste' ?
09:32  jeffszusz: hmmm
09:39  marlun: In macvim on at least a swedish keyboard ~ is very annoying to use to toggle case. When you hit it it waits for you to hit another key to create things like ñ and when I use it in macvim it first toggles the case of the char I'm over and then if I hit ESC or move left or do something it also toggles the case on the next char.
09:40  Raimondi: I know, I do ~h
09:41 --- PCMX is now known as dborba
09:41  marlun: Raimondi: still toggles the next char for me.
09:41  marlun: Because after toggleing the first char it moves to the next one and when I hit h it toggles the next one and then move left :)
09:43  aep: can't you choose a nodeadkey variant for your keyboard settings?
09:43  marlun: aep: Was that to me? If so I don't understand :)
09:44  aep: yes
09:44  Raimondi: I have a spanish layout, but I don't see why it should behave differently...
09:44  aep: well, you can change your keyboard layout. I'm unsure how it works on mac, but maybe there is a variant of your layout that has no deadkeys (ie the delayed thingy you experience)
09:45  Raimondi: marlun: Are you using the last snapshot? I think a bug was introduced in one of the latest snapshots.
09:45  jeffszusz: what exactly is "blockwise" visual? i know what linewise is...
09:46  iaj: jeffszusz: CTRL_V mode
09:46 * jeffszusz is already in a vim help window
09:46  Raimondi: jeffszusz: YOu can select rectangular areas
09:46  jeffszusz: oh?
09:47  RfADdlS: hi! How many recorded macros in vim can be done?
09:47  jeffszusz: RfADdlS: 26
09:48  jeffszusz: one for each letter
09:48  Raimondi: a to z
09:49  RfADdlS: jeffszusz: no. 100 @w example or 100000 @w
09:53  jeffszusz: ?
09:53  jeffszusz: OH
09:53  jeffszusz: i'm sure there's no limit
09:53  Raimondi: Maybe the sky? :)
09:54  jeffszusz: lol
09:54  jeffszusz: i'm trying and loving the surround plugin: i've figured out how to manipulate the tags around a word, a line, etc.
09:54  Raimondi: It's quite nice.
09:54  jeffszusz: but with a block i've only found out how to ADD surroundings to each line
09:54  jeffszusz: i can't figure out how to change
09:54  jeffszusz: because once in visual mode you can't do cs or ds
09:54  RfADdlS: jeffszusz: Sorry for my English. I record a macro. How many times it can reproduce. For example 100 @w or  100000 @w
09:55  jeffszusz: RfADdlS: I am pretty sure you can have it loop as many times as you'd like, but I don't know.
09:56  jeffszusz: I mean if you put three million it will probably hang...but who knows
09:57  RfADdlS: jeffszusz: At 1000 @ w works, but you need 362880 @ w - hangs.
09:58  RfADdlS: *I need
09:58  jeffszusz: i haven't any clue
10:11  jeffszusz: omg
10:11  RfADdlS: vim Killed if rum 100000 @w
10:11  jeffszusz: snipMate is FANTASTIC
10:11  systemfault: yep
10:13  systemfault: snipmate/surround/fuzzyfinder/nerdcommenter ftw.
10:13  Raimondi: RfADdlS: What are you trying to do?
10:14  RfADdlS: Raimondi: reproduce many times the recorded macro
10:14  Raimondi: What does your macro do? RfADdlS
10:14  jeffszusz: wow
10:15  jeffszusz: .<tab> = self.
10:15  jeffszusz: I think I would like to buy whoever made that a beer.
10:19  RfADdlS: Raimondi: finds the next character, deletes two and carries the following text but a new line. qw - n - 2x - i - enter - esc - q  play: 100000 @w
10:23  iaj: jeffszusz: what you mean with .<tab>?
10:23  jeffszusz: if in a .py file for python
10:23  jeffszusz: if you type .<tab> in insert mode
10:23  jeffszusz: it automatically puts self.  for you
10:24  jeffszusz: since you have to type self.methodname all the time
10:24  jeffszusz: so .<tab>methodname instead.
10:24  Raimondi: RfADdlS: YOu could try with this  :while getline('.') != getline('$') | exec "normal! n2xi\<CR>"|endwhile
10:27  Raimondi: YOu might be left with some pending work in the last line, but maybe it'll work.
10:29 * jeffszusz decides to not bother with textmate anymore
10:30  Raimondi: TextMate was a nice project, too bad it stopped evolving...
10:30  jeffszusz: textmate sometimes pisses me off
10:30  jeffszusz: i mean
10:30  jeffszusz: if i type
10:31  jeffszusz: well, anything that has a closing pair
10:31  jeffszusz: i have to move over (and i have to use the arrow keys) to the end of the line anyway to hit enter
10:31  jeffszusz: so having the closing tag after my cursor just gets in the way
10:31  jeffszusz: it's smart enough to know that if you type the closing tag, it should remove the one it put automatically, but still. defeats the purpose :P
10:32  RfADdlS: Raimondi: it works, but how to execute 362,880 times :)
10:33  RfADdlS: Raimondi: last action :)
10:33  Raimondi: RfADdlS: It will work from the current line until the end, you don't need to specify a number of times to be executed.
10:35  iaj: jeffszusz: you need a plugin for .<tab> to work don't you?
10:35  jeffszusz: laj, yes, snipMate
10:36  Raimondi: jeffszusz: Change your font, the nick is iaj with "i" as in irc :)
10:36  jeffszusz: if i open someone else's HTML file and it's formatted with horrifying whitespace, is there a way to neaten up the tabs etc?
10:36  RfADdlS: Raimondi: many thanks :)
10:36  jeffszusz: haha
10:36  jeffszusz: sorry iaj
10:36  iaj: hahah... I will forgive you - this time
10:36  iaj: thanks... oh well I'm using XPT instead of snip
10:36  Raimondi: RfADdlS: No problem :)
10:37  jeffszusz: XPT?
10:37  Raimondi: iaj: So you got XPT working, good :)
10:38  jeffszusz: for school we get html files that are formatted badly
10:38  jeffszusz: like
10:38  jeffszusz: mixed tabs and spaces
10:38  jeffszusz: is there a way to make vim straighten it all out for me?
10:38  jeffszusz: with 4-space tabs and such?
10:39  ElDios: jeffszusz do you want only tabs or only spaces?
10:39  jeffszusz: everytime there's a newline and a bunch of whitespace, i just want to make sure it's made of spaces in multiples of 4
10:39  jeffszusz: only spaces
10:40  jeffszusz: but not six or five or three; this teacher seems to like mixing it up.
10:40  jeffszusz: and i'm anal so i sit there counting spaces and making it all uniform
10:41  iaj: Raimondi: Yeah, Oh... you still remember that one? Nice!! Supertab was a problem... the combination Supertab,delimitMate,XPT 
10:41  iaj: brought some problems with it
10:41  gMinuses: how do i enable ascii art for vim?
10:41  Raimondi: Yeah, too many conflicting mappings...
10:42  iaj: Raimondi: yup!
10:42  iaj: Raimondi: one question, since I guess you are using delimitmate a lot yourself ;-) How do you jump over the closing brackets? ) } ] ?
10:43  Raimondi: <S-Tab>
10:43  iaj: Does that always work? Wherether I am in the block?
10:43  iaj: Nah only at the end I guess :)
10:44  Raimondi: Yeah, but that seems like a nice idea...
10:44  iaj: ofc, its mine.
10:44  iaj: ツ
10:44  Raimondi: Very please :)
10:46  gMinuses: doesn <S-Tab> mean shift+tab?
10:46  gMinuses: doesn't seem to work.
10:46  Raimondi: gMinuses:  :verbose imap <buffer> <S-Tab>
10:47  psycho23: I want the view of a file that I'm editing to be below the cursor.
10:48  jeffszusz: ElDios: is my spaces thing something i'll have to write myself?
10:48  ElDios: jeffszusz you could definitely use the :s command
10:48  ElDios: and do something like
10:49  ElDios: :%s:^s{1-3}\(.*\)$:    \1:
10:49  gMinuses: Raimondi: it says no mapping found
10:49  jeffszusz: holy crap
10:49  jeffszusz: that is one scary looking...regex?
10:50  ElDios: something like that =)
10:50  ElDios: anyway it's kinda simple
10:50  jeffszusz: what does it do
10:50  ElDios: % on every line - s substitute
10:51  ElDios: ^ (at the beginning of the line) \s (whitespace) {1-3} (SHOULD be from one to three times.. verify this) \(.*\)$ (and put everything else till the $ [end of the line] in arg \1)
10:51  Raimondi: gMinuses: Here's the same, I'll check what's wrong later.
10:51  ElDios: then put 4 spaces "    " and write what you put in the \1
10:51  gMinuses: ok
10:52  ElDios: hope I was clear enough
10:52  ElDios: I'll try that.. gimme a second
10:52  Raimondi: gMinuses: Meanwhile you can use this in your vimrc:  imap <S-Tab> <Plug>delimitMateS-Tab
10:53  iaj: ElDios: you missed the \s part here.
10:53  ElDios: lol.. you were right
10:53  gMinuses: but it only jumps over one level, which can be achieved by just type it.
10:53  ElDios: you're*
10:53  ElDios: jeffszusz something is wrong anyway
10:54  gMinuses: i was looking for a method to just over to the out most level
10:54  jeffszusz: hm
10:54  ElDios: I'm working on it =)
10:54  jeffszusz: thanks ElDios :)
10:54  Raimondi: :%s/^\s{4}*\(\s*\)$/\1/
10:55  jeffszusz: what search term do i use to find :help (block collapsing)
10:55  jeffszusz: ?
10:55  iaj: Block collapsing? is that folding?
10:55  jeffszusz: folding! ok thanks
10:55  Raimondi: That should trim all spaces in groups of 4, is that what you wanted? jeffszusz
10:55  iaj: seems alike ;)
10:55  jeffszusz: yes
10:55  jeffszusz: will it support 4, 8, 12, etc?
10:56  Raimondi: :%s/^\s\{4}*\(\s*\)$/\1/
10:56  Raimondi: jeffszusz: It should :)
10:57  jeffszusz: so if i want to make that into a command i can type, i would do something like
10:58  jeffszusz: command: cleanwhitespace :%s/^\s\{4}*\(\s*\)$/\1/<CR>
10:58  Raimondi: jeffszusz: This is tested:  :%s/^\(\s\{4}\)*\(\s*\)$/\2/
10:58  Raimondi: Yep, just delete the <CR>
10:58  jeffszusz: oh, no enter after the command?
10:59  Raimondi: Actually   command cleanwhitespace %s/^\(\s\{4}\)*\(\s*\)$/\2/
10:59  Raimondi: No, that's only for mappings
11:00  ElDios: Raimondi what jeffszusz wants is: if \s {1-4} then put 4 spaces, if 4-8 then 8, if 9-12 then 12.. am I right jeffszusz ?
11:00  ElDios: 1-4 5-8 9-12 13-16 and so on
11:01  jeffszusz: mostly yes
11:01  jeffszusz: let's see if this works anyway
11:01  ElDios: yep
11:02  jeffszusz: hm
11:02  jeffszusz: not an editor command
11:04  spiiph: What's wrong with :retab and gg=G?
11:04  jeffszusz: erf
11:12  jeffszusz: command cleantabs %s/^\s\{4}*\(\s*\)$/\1/
11:12  jeffszusz: that does not work
11:12  jeffszusz: it says not editor command
11:15  spiiph: You need to start commands with a capital letter
11:16  jeffszusz: oh thankya
11:17  jeffszusz: damn
11:19  jeffszusz: ohwell time for bed.
11:19  jeffszusz: goodnight folks, thanks for all the help :)

11:20 --- silex is now known as Silex
11:52  iaj: Someone here occasionnally using nercommenter AND LustyBufExplorer?
11:59 --- sjl_ is now known as sjl
12:16  spiiph: vimgor, anyone
12:16  vimgor: Please do not ask if anyone uses, knows, is good with, can help you with or is a guru/expert of <some program>. Instead, ask your real question. You'll probably get help faster that way.
12:16  iaj: i used someone ;)
12:17  iaj: But my problem is that when using lustybuf, and trying to switch to some csv files for example... I try to type in 'csv' but since cs is also a mapping from Nerdcommenter I get stuck :\
12:20  spiiph: NERDcommenter doesn't use cs-anything as far as I can recall. Are you sure you're not talking about surround.vim?
12:21  iaj: spiiph: argh, my bad
12:21  iaj: yeah its surround.vim :\
12:21  iaj: I'd need to deactivate that in the LustyBufferExplorer Window I think but I don't know how to do so.
12:39  derdon: hello
12:40  derdon: I'm sitting here in front of a mac and have already vim installed. how do I enable the perl-interface for vim?
12:40  silasdavis: what key can I use to scan to the next incident of a character across multiple lines
12:41  silasdavis: e.g. on the same line I would do df} to delete up to next '}'
12:42  spiiph: d/}
12:44  silasdavis: spiiph: doesn't work for me
12:44  silasdavis: takes me to next }, but doesn't delete
12:44  spiiph: Did you hit d before you performed the search?
12:49  silasdavis: spiiph: yes
12:49  silasdavis: although I am using ViEmu in visual studio, let me try in vim
12:50  spiiph: Note that you need to hit <CR> after having performed the search, in case you have incsearch turned on
12:52  silasdavis: yeah..
12:52  silasdavis: that was it, thanks
12:56  derdon: and now you geeks tell me how to enable perl support *after* having vim installed =)
12:56 --- sjl_ is now known as sjl
12:57  spiiph: derdon, what does :echo has("perl") say?
12:57  derdon: spiiph: 0
12:58  spiiph: Then you need to get another vim package, or recompile. Provided that it's the perl interface you're after.
12:59  derdon: yes, I was already apprehensive of it
12:59  toe: is it possible to open additional files while keeping the currently edited file/s open? :edit filename accepts only one filename and closes the currently opened file/s
12:59  derdon: I will download the sources then
12:59  spiiph: toe, :h 'hidden
12:59  derdon: toe: hsplit and vsplit, tabnew
13:01  derdon: does anyone use VimIRC here btw?
13:01  spiiph: No.
13:03  toe: derdon: tabnew is seems nice. thanks
13:03  derdon: toe: I couldn't live without it :D
13:04  derdon: toe: I also use vsplit very often
13:04  spiiph: Tabs are not what they seem.
13:04  spiiph: vimgor, tabs
13:04  vimgor: Tab pages are not buffers, don't try to force them to act like buffers. Consider tab pages like viewports, layouts, or workspaces. Trying to setup 1 tab page == 1 buffer is an exercise in futility. Do ':set hidden' and get started. Get FuzzyFinder, LustyExplorer or BufExplorer to make getting around your buffers easier. See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Tabs for more info.
13:05  spiiph: Also, you don't need tabs or additional windows to have several files open.
13:06  derdon: spiiph: but in my opinion, tabs are quite handy
13:07  spiiph: They are handy as viewports, not as keeping track of buffers.
13:07  sqz: I use tabs just like tabs in visual C, or devcpp
13:07  spiiph: sqz, except that you can't really do that in Vim.
13:08  sqz: spiiph: why not? I'm doing it every day?
13:08  derdon: spiiph: and tabs are saved within a vim session which is kinda cool
13:08  spiiph: sqz, because Vim doesn't have a way to tie a tab to a buffer.
13:08  sqz: when I press 'CTRL-T' a new tab appears, and together with NERDCommenter its similar like any IDE
13:09  dindinx: sqz: until you :make
13:09  spiiph: Until you start using quickfix, or jumplists
13:09  spiiph: Or tags
13:09  spiiph: Whithout the use of which you are seriously crippled in your development environment.
13:09  sqz: dindinx: make works perfectly, but I have my own custom shortcuts (F1/F2) listed on the bottom on my screen
13:10  sqz: aah I get it guys..you don't WANT it to work :)
13:10  sqz: :P
13:10  spiiph: sqz, no. It _DOESN'T_ work.
13:10  sqz: well it depends what you define by working, for me it's working everyday for years
13:10  derdon: sqz: do you know NERD tree? it's very useful when working in a project with multiple files
13:11  sqz: derdon: yes I use it everyday, its great!
13:11  dindinx: sqz: no, we want to warn people there is _no_ one-to-one buffer/tab mapping in vim. And relying on one is very wrong.
13:11  venky10: NERDTree doesn't work in vim 6?
13:11  derdon: sqz: but this only what the matrix wants you to think! in fact, you're not even using vim. vim does not exist. it's only in your imagination
13:12  sqz: dindinx: yes, but maybe try to things not only from a technical esthetic viewpoint
13:12  derdon: dindinx: well, I know it but nervertheless I use vim's tab features
13:12  sqz: dindinx: you almost sound like these people who say 'never run that program as root'
13:12  venky10: Then again, I don't want to get used to a lot of customization I can't do without. Because, then its hard to work on someone else's computer
13:13 --- Nyoxi_ is now known as Nyoxi
13:13  dindinx: then you'll be bitten by this sooner or later, but please, please do NOT encourage people to use tabs badly.
13:14  derdon: dindinx: ok
13:14  sqz: dindinx: ok if you want..
13:15  dindinx: sqz: how should I say that? You use of tabs is very broken, it can only work it you use no more than 1% of vim features. Telling people to do the same is just silly, they'll be very disappointed when they'll discover that they've been lied to when trying to use advanced stuff.
13:15  spiiph: sqz, in that case, I guess you're using useopen, usetab and newtab as settings to 'switchbuf', which breaks location lists. And you can't really use jumplists, since that would take you to another buffer and likely break the 1 buffer to 1 tab correspondence?
13:16  derdon: dindinx: I really have the feeling that I use only 0.001% of vim's features
13:18  sqz: maybe so, I don't use 'jumplists', I only use F5/F6 (next/prev tab), F8 (next splitwindow), and CTRL-^ for switching between last/newest file within window
13:18  spiiph: So what do you do if you have 50+ files open?
13:19  sqz: spiiph: I never have 50+ files open, I only have the files open which I need to be working in (+/- 10)
13:19  dindinx: or if you want to open the file whose name is under the cursor with gf ?
13:19  sqz: well I use NERDcommenter for that actually
13:20  derdon: yeah, I also have around 10 files open
13:20  sqz: the 'gf' also is not for me, I do PHP programming and I have automapping features for including files (I don't use include functions like in PHP4)
13:21  dindinx: sqz: see how you don't use vim's features?
13:21  sqz: therefore, NERDcommenter is great, but I can imagine 'gf' would be great for coding C, and ctags etc
13:21  spiiph: ctags is great for php as well
13:22  sqz: spiiph: yes indeed, I use it daily
13:22  sqz: dindinx: what you say makes no sense
13:22  sqz: dindinx: I use vim features which were carefully researched by myself, they exactly fit my need
13:23  sqz: dindinx: so no, ofcoarse I will not use all of them
13:23  sqz: dindinx: and to be honest, it doesnt matter to me if you use arrow keys or 'hjkl', you should use whatever works for you
13:23  derdon: sqz: correct. using only 1% of vim's features or less doesn't make you a bad person!
13:23 --- EselTheo_ is now known as EselTheo
13:24  sqz: yes! people who use 1% of vim's features are also human beings! :P
13:25  sqz: but I think dindinx has great vim skills, and has worked with it for lots of years
13:25  sqz: I have never met somebody who edits 50+ files :)
13:26  spiiph: I regularly edit 10-20, and regularly read another 30-50
13:27  sqz: spiiph: don't you find yourself scrolling like crazy, trying to find that file you want to edit?
13:27  sqz: spiiph: that was my experience when I started working with hidden buffers etc..big epilepsia!
13:27  spiiph: Scrolling?
13:27  DestinyAwaits: spiiph : Hello, Sir :-)
13:27  spiiph: Why would I have to scroll anything?
13:27  spiiph: DestinyAwaits, hi
13:27  sqz: well rotating buffers...or whatever you call it..I don't use it
13:28  paissad: hi all,i would like to compile a mxml file when i hit <C-B> ... here is what i did:
13:28  paissad: autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.mxml set filetype=mxml :nmap <C-B> :!mxmlc %:p
13:28  paissad: but this does not work yet, how should i proceed ?
13:28  spiiph: sqz, why would I rotate buffers?
13:28  smorg: What's wrong with tabs? I don't use them that often... generally if i'm working on two very different tasks I separate them with tabs
13:28  spiiph: smorg, that's what tabs are designed for.
13:28  paissad: thanks in advance for helping  (i want to compile the file being edited of course)
13:28  spiiph: paissad, make two :autocmds, and use :nmap <buffer> too
13:29  sqz: spiiph: well if you have 50+ files open...I assume one of them is visible on your screen right?
13:29  spiiph: Well, regularly 3-6, but no more than that.
13:30  smorg: I'm actually currently looking for a replacement for minibufexplorer... it seems to break a lot of colorschemes.
13:30  sqz: spiiph: suppose that is file #1, then you want to go to file #12
13:30  spiiph: sqz, buffer completion is by far the quickest way to navigate between files. Some people use FuzzyFinder to that effect as well.

13:30  spiiph: Again, why would you rotate buffers? That's just silly.
13:31  sqz: forget about rotating buffers, I mentioned the name 'rotating' only to describe what you used :)
13:31  spiiph: But it doesn't describe what I use.

13:34  spiiph: I have none.
13:35  derdon: and...?
13:35  spiiph: That's kinda it. I have never tried, thus I have no opinion about it.
13:36  smorg: I read about it briefly. Sounds like an interesting replacement for gvim
13:36  smorg: cept I never use gvim

14:31  paradigm: oh right
14:31  paradigm: yeah

14:34  paradigm: iuno
14:35  Zathrus: cap_sensitive: it shouldn't be an issue. :map does not affect insert mode.
14:37  cap_sensitive: Zathrus: yes, It's not a issue. But What I want is map `'" to `''" except when I type something like ``I'm a ... ". thanks
14:37  Zathrus: ...
14:38  Zathrus: please stop trying to do "smart quotes" in a text medium. They look awful.
14:38  fow: Zathrus, imaps definitely affect insert mode
14:38  Zathrus: fow: I know they do.
14:38  Zathrus: fow: but I didn't say :imap -- I said :map
14:38  fow: I'm very certain cap_sensitive meant to say imap despite saying map
14:40  g0bl1n: hi, I want to substitute array[:field_1].method array[:field_2].method array[:field_n].method strings by 0.method. What it the best s///g condition ?
14:40  Zathrus: in which case it's STILL not an issue unless you take a second to type ' and then m

14:41  Zathrus: g0bl1n: always 0?
14:41  g0bl1n: Zathrus, yes
14:42  fow: cap_sensitive, Zathrus meant using the smart quotes on IRC is confusing, which I agree with
14:42  cap_sensitive: fow: Got it. I'm sorry about that.
14:42  Zathrus: g0bl1n: :%s/\[:field_\d\+\]/0/g    -- presuming you really meant _n is always a digit.
14:43  fow: cap_sensitive, consider taking a look at some of the tex vimscripts that magically handle quotes

15:13  ggergely: is such functionality availble in vimŰ?
15:13  spiiph: Vim only displays text.
15:14  Silex: I kinda doubt emacs displays pictures
15:14  estragib: oh, it does
15:14  Silex: over ssh? :)
15:15  estragib: uhm. :p
15:15  Silex: no well, maybe the gui wrapper adds fancy picture handling
15:15  ggergely: http://www.gohome.org/wl/wl-e21.png
15:15  Silex: cool
15:16  spiiph: Looks horrible. :)
15:16  Axius: Does vim have a calc?
15:16  spiiph: Depends on what you mean
15:17  estragib: spiiph: this one is kind of nice: http://julien.danjou.info/images/gnus-gravatar.png
15:17  spiiph: Vim evaluates expressions
15:17  spiiph: estragib, still looks horrible imo
15:17  estragib: not for me either :)
15:18  Silex: so this is the gui wrapper of emacs doing some tricks right?
15:18  ggergely: yeah.
15:18  ggergely: this yould be nice in vim also, imo.
15:18  spiiph: Why?
15:19  Axius: How can I activate the lua interface in vim?
15:19  spiiph: Vim is a text editor, not an image viewer.
15:19  ggergely: to display email?
15:19 * spiiph prefers a web browser for that.
15:19  ggergely: actually the terminals should support drawing
15:19  Silex: using vim to read emails sounds just wrong
15:19  ggergely: like on plan9

15:59  spiiph: You can create a script to do it, if you plan on doing it often
16:01  marlun: Don't think I'll use it that much, just want it in my script now :)
16:02  smorg: marlun: python -c 'import string; print(list(string.ascii_lowercase));'

16:02  nemo: huh
16:02  nemo: you know
16:03  nemo: you'd think you could do that w/ a numeric loop more easily

16:05  nemo: smorg: heh. I meant in vim script :-p
16:05  nemo: or does vim use python now?
16:06  smorg: idk. I think it does actually. Or just copypasta the python output
16:06  fow: Vim can use Python, Perl, Ruby, and as of 7.3 I think Lua, if such interfaces are enabled
16:08 --- sjl_ is now known as sjl
16:10  marlun: Best way I found in vim script is: let lowercase = split('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', '\zs')

16:11  marlun: :)
16:11  smorg: vim script is near the bottom of my very long list of languages to learn.
16:12  marlun: Well I need it to work when vim is not compiled with python support.
16:12  smorg: I'd think the lua support would be pretty lightweight
16:12  smorg: Apparently it's super easy to integrate into some existing codebase like vim
16:13  nemo: marlun: huh. vim seems to have countless ways to convert hex, dec, oct into ascii/unicode
16:13  nemo: marlun: surely you could do iterating over 1-26 + offset and pushing into a list in vim script
16:13  nemo: I guess defining all the chars is less work
16:13  nemo: marlun: is vim typically built w/ perl support?
16:15  marlun: I've got no idea, sorry :)
16:15  nemo: oh well
16:15  nemo: my question was answered
16:16  nemo: thanks and seeya
16:16  smorg: I suppose back in the day when lisp was the python emacs made lots of sense
16:20  smorg: wish they stuck the uppsercase, lowercase, and digits adjacent in the ascii so you only had to remember one number instead of 3

16:42  marlun: hmmm, that wasn't very good.
16:43  marlun: Figured out I had to use execute since I needed to use an expression to get the value of char into the mapping.
16:43  marlun: However since  mapped all my keys I couldn't get out of the buffer in a normal way. Had to do ctrl-w

16:57  smorg: Actually Haskell probably has the simplest possible way.
16:57  smorg: ghc -e "['a'..'z']"
16:58  smorg: But since strings ARE lists you won't get the right representation of the output.

17:19  jeffszusz: not sure how to specify lines Karella but if you do
17:19  jeffszusz: :vsplit
17:19  Karella: yes, but vsplit does not allow to scroll
17:20  jeffszusz: you would have to scroll them independantly
17:20  Karella: yes.
17:20  jeffszusz: i don't know how to do the rest of what you ask
17:20  Karella: I'm looking for a plugin to scroll both of part dependantly

17:21  mhoy06: there are a ton of other things I want to add but need to know what direction to search for adding functionality
17:22  jeffszusz: mhoy06: check out the "snipMate" plugin
17:22  jeffszusz: you would do
17:22  jeffszusz: script<tab> in insert mode and it'd set it up for you
17:23  jeffszusz: it also does all the major tags including doctype
17:23  Karella: jeffszusz, it seems possible to do what I want with scrollbind
17:23  mhoy06: jeffszusz: thx
17:24  julesa: Any philosophical thoughts on why to maintain a .gvimrc over an single .vimrc ?
17:24  jeffszusz: mhoy06: you might want to go into the html.snippets file and add something to the <div> snippet. it automatically adds an id tag for you, but I modified it so it would let me choose id or class
17:28  fow: julesa, there are enough GUI specific commands that one might find it cleaner/easier to navigate/whatever to put them in a separate file rather than in an if has('gui_running') block
17:29  julesa: fow: Pretty much what I was thinking.
17:29  julesa: fow: Thanks for that thought. Sometimes it's good to know that you might not actually screw with your .vimrc for a whole week.
17:29  fow: Personally, since I spend very, very little time in gvim, I want my vimrc to be as GUI-agnostic as possible
17:29  fow: hehe
17:30  Oleg_: How do I name a file inside vim?
17:31  fow: Oleg_, I think you want one of :w, :saveas, or :e

17:34  jeffszusz: awesome
17:34  jeffszusz: ahahaha
17:35 * julesa tried flipping vim over on its side and the text didn't flow into two columns. This is a great fix.
17:35  Karella: I've never see an iPad :-/
17:35  julesa: Karella: If ever there was a device that wasn't vim friendly this would be it.
17:35  jeffszusz: haha
17:36  julesa: Karella: Although it does have the option for a Bluetooth keyboard. So theoretically it might be useful.

17:38  smorg: seems there's quite a few variants (and mine breaks a lot of the colorschemes and looks rather unmaintained)
17:43  bharris: so to continue my breakat jazz. I have it set so that the only breakat character is the \ but when formatting the text, it still breaks it at + and , Is there another setting I'm missing
17:49  jeffszusz: i have :inoremap ` ~
17:49  jeffszusz: but
17:49  jeffszusz: I actually want it to sub ` for ~ in 'command' mode.
17:50  jeffszusz: instead of inoremap is there a particular thing i should be using?
17:50  graywh: the i means insert mode
17:50  jeffszusz: yes
17:50  jeffszusz: can i simply replace it with 'c ?
17:51  graywh: that's for cmdline mode
17:51  jeffszusz: so
17:51  graywh: you want n
17:51  jeffszusz: cnoremap works?
17:52  jeffszusz: i want command, not normal
17:52  jeffszusz: when i'm typing
17:52  jeffszusz: :e ~/ all the time
17:52  graywh: normal == command
17:52  jeffszusz: then command line is what i want
17:53  jeffszusz: not normal mode
17:53  jeffszusz: after typing : and going down to the cmdline
17:53  jeffszusz: okay cool cnoremap works
17:53  jeffszusz: :D
17:53  jeffszusz: i thought i was just making silly assumptions that c would work.
