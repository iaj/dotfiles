00:59  berserkerxiii: how do you mass replace with a prompt in vim?
01:01  spiiph: :h :s
01:02  tlp: :%s/pattern/replacement/cg
01:02  tlp: c for confirm
01:03  tlp: and what spiiph said, since :help is the most important thing you can learn about vim :p
01:04  berserkerxiii: whats the g?
01:04  tlp: :h :s
01:04  tlp: it'll tell you in there
01:04  berserkerxiii: ok
01:05  berserkerxiii: oh
01:05  berserkerxiii: global
01:06  tlp: I thought it meant global, but :help is contradicting my memory
01:06  tlp: unless the wording is poor
01:07  spiiph: It means global
01:08  Raimondi: global in the line?
01:08  Raimondi: Doesn't sound right...
01:08  strull: yes, global. Thought the term is no longer used in the help
01:08  tlp: "[g]     Replace all occurrences in the line."
01:08  berserkerxiii: no, im wrong
01:08  tlp: I think it's just clunky wording
01:08  spiiph: Actually, Vim doesn't call it global. You're right.
01:09  berserkerxiii: its not global, i skimmed. im actually reading now.
01:09  spiiph: But it used to mean global
01:09  tlp: I think without it it scans each line and replaces only the first occurrence, whereas with it, it'll replace all occurrences on each line
01:09  tlp: it definitely applies to the whole document, not just the current line
01:10  strull: tlp: wrong
01:10  strull: the % makes it apply to the whole doc
01:10  tlp: what's your interpretation, then?
01:10  berserkerxiii: i figured out how to make vim do what i wanted in case you guys care.
01:10  berserkerxiii: i needed the command :%s/'/"/cg
01:11  tlp: if you do :%s/blah/blah/ without g, you won't necessarily get all instances
01:11  strull: yes
01:11  berserkerxiii: without g you get the first instance in each line
01:11  strull: but without the % you won't either
01:11  berserkerxiii: youll get every instance in the line youre on
01:11  strull: yes
01:11  tlp: yep
01:12  tlp: strull: um? Isn't that what I just said?
01:12  strull: maybe I just misunderstood you
01:12  strull: g alone does not apply to the whole doc. That was my objection
01:12  tlp: ok
01:14  berserkerxiii: are we all happy now?
01:14  tlp: I think so :p
01:14  strull: I sure am
01:14  tlp: Lack of understanding sucks, especially when it comes to something as complicated as vim.
01:29  Flecha: hi! I am editing a script to grep my code and show the errors, but when I grep the code, VIM flashes to show the terminal. Is there a way to avoid it?
01:29  strull: I suppose you are on windows?
01:30  Flecha: no
01:30  Flecha: Linux
01:30  Flecha: gnome-terminal
01:31  strull: then track down what command exactly causes the flashing. "a script" is not very precise
01:31  Flecha: "silent! grep! %" causes the flash
01:32  Flecha: it runs pylint in my code
01:32  Flecha: and parse the errors
01:34  Flecha: to show in quickfix window
01:35  Flecha: I tried calling the function with: map <F7> :call Pylint()<CR>     and with:    au User <buffer> call Pylint()   , but both do that
03:04  drbean: The requirement that functions have parentheses for the arguments when both called and defined even when there are no arguements was a tripup.
03:12  strull: whatever a "tripup" might be
03:15  pattern: i think he means it was something that he didn't expect and that caused him some grief
03:16  pattern: if you're walking along a road and you trip over something, you could say that thing "tripped you up" or was "a tripup"
03:16  pattern: (just a wild guess.. maybe he meant something else)
03:22  tappi: drbean that's pretty normal if you've ever programmed in any language
03:22  tappi: the existence of parentheses usually is one of the defining properties of functions
03:50 --- walt is now known as narwhal
03:50  heoa: When you create new args list with ":n args", how can you switch btw lists?,
03:51 --- narwhal is now known as narwhalt
04:47  zulax: how do i switch between my vertical tabs in gvim
04:48  tappi: what's a vertical tab?
04:48  zulax: vsplit
04:49  tappi: oh those
04:49  tappi: ctrl-w w doesn't work?
04:49  zulax: it does, thaks tappi
04:49  tappi: right :P
04:49  zulax: i did some google search but couldnt find it exactly
04:49  zulax: actually, i dont think i knew what to search for
04:50  tappi: :help :vs?
04:50  tappi: or help :split
04:50  zulax: yup, :)
04:50  tappi: but yeah i know the feeling
04:51  tappi: most of the stuff is easy to find when you're used to the system, but if you're not it can feel like you have no idea what to search for
04:51  zulax: yup,
04:52  zulax: well, i have been now using vim for a while and i am catching it
04:52  tappi: kewl :P
04:52  zulax: but I problem i am learning all the things at once (like databases, scripting langs, prog langs....) so becoming expert at something particular will still take time
04:53  tappi: :P
04:59 --- tcunha_ is now known as tcunha
05:00  eft: I'm buying a new keyboard and would like to get one that works well with vim.  Any suggestions?  (My current one has the ESC key way too far from other keys.)
05:01  tappi: http://idg.bg/test/pcw/2008/9/8/7231-Logitech_Ultra_Flat.jpg
05:01  tappi: you should get that one in any case, i use ctrl-c instead of esc though
05:02  tappi: esc is too far no matter what keyboard you're using
05:03  eft: tappi: so why is that one better than others for vim or any other reason?
05:04  tappi: because there's no silly space between the esc and f1-12 keys
05:04  tappi: the esc one shouldn't help you with vim, but it will help you with a ton of other applications and games
05:04  tmr: I would say that any keyboard that is comfortable to write is fine with vim.
05:07  eft: fair enough - tx for the advice
05:07  tappi: it's also very cheap
05:08  tappi: supporters of keyboards that have mechanical switches say that the bad thing about non-mechanical keyboards is that they lose their touch because the switches wear in a few years
05:09  eft: well I currently have a MS Natural Keyboard that was given to me as a gift about 10 years ago !
05:09  tappi: but :P
05:09  tappi: because they're so expensive it's just cheaper to buy a new normal keyboard when the old one is not up to par anymore
05:10  tappi: plus the switch is not the only part in a keyboard that wears, and there's nothing in mechanical keyboards that makes them impervious to harm
05:10  tappi: which is the reason that's exactly the keyboard i use
05:11  tappi: it's compact, the keys are close to each other, it is not any worse than any other normal keyboard to write with, and it is very cheap
05:11  tappi: like 19e
05:11  tappi: also it has every key a full keyboard has, ie. no double size delete keys instead of an insert, all of them are there
05:12  tappi: also one more thing, the application key is on the left side of the keyboard which i find very useful as a avid voice software user
05:12  tappi: it's hard to find a key that's not in use in applications that make use of many keys, but no application uses the application key, and it's easy to use it with your left hand while you're using your mouse
05:13  tappi: also it's easier to use it period if you use it at all :P
05:14  eft: you should blog about it :)
05:15  tappi: i like to rant in irc more
05:18  eft: tappi: does this look like the one you have? http://www.logitech.com/en-ca/keyboards/keyboard/devices/6007
05:31 --- GinoMan is now known as GinoSleeps
05:32  thepro4ever: i want to take my current line and append it to the end of my previous line
05:32  thepro4ever: how do i do this thing
05:32  thepro4ever: in window editors all i have to do is go to the start of the current line and hit backspace
05:34  thepro4ever: in windows i mean
05:34  homekevin: thepro4ever: J
05:34  Raimondi: thepro4ever: :h J  and :h gJ
05:35  homekevin: thepro4ever: Also, :h 'backspace'
05:46  pattern: thepro4ever: if you want no intervening space between your current and previous lines, you could try this:
05:46  pattern: kJx
05:47  pattern: that sequence of keys could also be bound (or "mapped", in vi terminology) to a single key, if you like
05:48  pattern: here's an example:
05:48  pattern: :nnoremap <F1> kJx
05:51  pattern: after you've done that, hitting the F1 key will join the current line to the previous line, without an intervening space
05:52  Chapoolin: <F1> is canonical "help" key
05:53  pattern: i just used F1 as an example
05:53  pattern: you can bind it to any key
05:55  danielsh: :j!
05:55  danielsh: joins without adding space
05:56  danielsh: more specifically   :-j!
05:57  danielsh: :hel cmdline-range
06:06  exherboer: Shouldn't "set noesckeys" get rid of the delay when exiting insert mode with ^[ ?
06:07  exherboer: I also tried "set ttimeoutlen=1", but I still get a full second delay.
06:08  scp1: exherboer:: i love you
06:08  exherboer: scp1: why's that?
06:08  scp1: set noesckeys solved an issue I've had for 3 years
06:08  exherboer: :)
06:08  exherboer: what issue was that?
06:08  scp1: I write stuff like \$ a lot... \ <LONG DELAY> $
06:09  Random832: also in normal mode gJ joins without a space
06:09  scp1: oh crap it didnt work for perl files
06:09  Random832: oh, wait that was already mentioned
06:11  tappi: eft no
06:12  tappi: oh yeah, if i recall correctly that ultra flat keyboard isn't sold in the us
06:15  Dijit: ssh dijit@10.0.1.8 export DISPLAY=:0; mplayer ~/Videos/somefile.avi -fs
06:15  Dijit: full of win
06:16  exherboer: ah it seems I only get the delay when I run vim in tmux
06:17  exherboer: or screen
06:27  eft: tappi: no worries - I can look for similar model.  thanks again for your insights.
06:37  weisen: question about building ctags database on osx for the autocppcompletion plugin
06:37  weisen: running 'ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q --language-force=C++ -f cpp /usr/include/c++' i get 'ctags: illegal option --R'
06:48  bairui: weisen: apparently osx ships with a non-standard ctags.
06:49  deryni: non-standard or just non-exuberant?
06:49  bairui: isn't exuberent *the* standard?! ;)
06:49  bairui: ant even
06:51  bairui: so, yeah, deryni says it better: get yourself an exuberant ctags, weisen. I'm not an osxer, but a dim memory suggests there's a homebrew or espresso or something like that available...
06:53  weisen: im onto that will report
06:55  abhijeet: anyone maintaining the site vi-improved.org.. It's look like destred.
06:55  abhijeet: deserted
06:57  Axioplase_: abhijeet: that should be MetaCosm, iirc
06:57  abhijeet: Axioplase_: what does it mean by metaCosm IRC
07:07  Axioplase_: abhijeet: that should be user "MetaCosm (= MetaCosm)", "if I remember correctly (= iirc)"
07:09  abhijeet: Axioplase_: OK
07:09  scp1: So I just bought the oreilly vim book. Are there more goodness that might be recommended?

09:00  Maahes: cs 2
09:01  Maahes: okay, its the files, I used saner settings and they still turn to drek
09:02  Maahes: they're still readable though
09:02  Maahes: all the data's still there.
09:06  TzilTzal: any help on the netbean protocol?
09:06  JZA: hi how can I reduce the default identation of code
09:08  JZA: ie. I want to reduce the identation of html
09:08  JZA: y see /usr/share/vim/indent/html.vim
09:08  JZA: but I wonder if there is an easier way to change all indentation
09:14  Maahes: okay, I set it to 774 and the files didn't go nuts, but it also didn't fix vim. I had got vim to show syntax highlighting a little earlier with 645 even though it subsequently broke. =\
09:16  Maahes: 774 should be sane value right? (I used an octal calculator)
09:17  Maahes: oh hey! plugins work, now it's just the theme that doesn't
09:20  et: Maahes: chmod -R with a fixed number is almost never sane
09:33  TzilTzal: I'm not getting the events mentioned in the netbean interface... :(
09:33  TzilTzal: any ideas why?
09:33  Raimondi: TzilTzal: How are they related to Vim? I have no idea...
09:34  TzilTzal: what do you mean how?
09:34  TzilTzal: :he netbeans
09:34  Raimondi: looking the help...
09:34  TzilTzal: vim is supposed to send these events over the socket
09:36  Raimondi: TzilTzal: Sorry, my Vim-fu is not up to the challenge.
09:36  TzilTzal: huh?
09:36  Raimondi: TzilTzal: I can't be of any help.
09:36  TzilTzal: ok
09:40  elik: TzilTzal: :version is probably a good place to start looking
09:40  TzilTzal: ?
09:40  elik: TzilTzal: but I'm afraid I won't be able to help much more
09:40  TzilTzal: I can communicate with the server...
09:40  TzilTzal: I'm just not getting these events
09:40  elik: TzilTzal: yes, and do you know what :version is?
09:41  TzilTzal: yes
09:41  elik: TzilTzal: have you looked in :version to make sure netbean support was enabled?
09:41  TzilTzal: if netbeans wasn't compiled in, I wouldn't be communicating with the server :)
09:41  TzilTzal: of course.
09:41  TzilTzal: as I said: Vim communicates with the server.
09:42  elik: oh, sorry, you can, thought you said you couldn't
09:42  TzilTzal: I can.. but I'm not getting the events that are listed in the docs
09:51  Raimondi: TzilTzal: Consider asking in the vim_use mailing list, you'll reach more people that way...
09:51  TzilTzal: thx

10:54  b14ck: Question:
10:55  b14ck: I'm trying to learn vim better, and I'd like to start building my vimrc from scratch so I understand all the options I have, and can play around with stuff.
10:55  b14ck: Is a good way to see all of the options via `:set all`?
10:55  b14ck: It shows a bunch of stuff.
10:55  b14ck: Is that all of it though?
10:56  notbobby: Just start with `:help`, you'll find everything there.
10:58  et: is there a way to share registers between macvim windows other than using :clipboard=unnamed?
11:00  Raimondi: et: MacVim allows you to copy, cut and paste using the clipboard with Command-C, Command-X and Command-V
11:00  Raimondi: et: From the GUI
11:03  et: Raimondi: yes, but that's "unnatural" for my reflexes
11:03  et: Raimondi: also, i'd like to share all registers
11:05  Raimondi: et: Oh! I don't think you can share registers between different Vim instances. The option clipboard makes Vim use the system clipboard, so it's not really sharing one of its registers with the other instances.
11:41  cizra: Hi. I'm trying to open a text file of unknown quality in GVim, on Windwoes. When I do :e ++enc=ucs2-le, it says [NOT converted], but (for example) Notepad opens it just fine. What might be the cause? Illegal characters in the text file? Bad Vim configuration?
12:03  Kunda: how do i change shell behavior to emulate vim ?
12:06  FernandoBasso: set -o vi
13:16  jsquared: I see that ^W moves me to the next window in a tab. How do I move to the previous window in a tab?
13:17  jsquared: Or, rather, is there a Ctrl-* shortcut that will let me move to the previous window.
13:18  FernandoBasso: jsquared: :nnoremap <C-P> :tabprevious<Return>
13:19  jsquared: FernandoBasso: I'm concerned about doing that since I've never found a good way in Vim to determine if I'm duplicating keyboard shortcuts.
13:20  FernandoBasso: jsquared: :verbose :nnoremap <C-P>
13:20  FernandoBasso: Will tell you.
13:21  jsquared: FernandoBasso: Hmm, that's not quite what I meant. I'm not worried about clobbering an existing shortcut for Ctrl-P, but rather about having *two or more* macros that do the same thing.
13:21  FernandoBasso: jsquared: You mean, if there already is a default mapping to go to the previous tab?
13:21  jsquared: (Also, I don't want the previous tab, but rather the previous window.)
13:22  sitaktif_: gT
13:22  FernandoBasso: jsquared: ^6
13:22  jsquared: FernandoBasso: Right.
13:22  FernandoBasso: :b#
13:22  sitaktif_: FernandoBasso: no, this is previous buffer
13:22 --- raorn_ is now known as raorn
13:24  FernandoBasso: I'm confused! 'Previous window in a tab".
13:26  sitaktif_: this means, when there are splits, go to previous split...
13:27  peth: ^W^W does that, doesn't it
13:27  sitaktif_: <c-w>p
13:27  jsquared: ^W^W advances two windows
13:27  sitaktif_: :help CTRL-W  (and go down a bit)
13:27  sitaktif_: jsquared: no
13:27  FernandoBasso: sitaktif_: So, gT is for tabs, not windows in a tab.
13:27  sitaktif_: default setting is described below
13:28  sitaktif_: FernandoBasso: yes
13:28  FernandoBasso: ^w^w is way easier for me.
13:28  sitaktif_: I answered to the question but he wrote "(Also, I don't want the previous tab, but rather the previous window.)" just before I pressed enter
13:28  sitaktif_: (actually I just did not read, because 5 seconds is not "just before" ^_^ )
13:29  FernandoBasso: sitaktif_: :)
13:29  jsquared: sitaktif_: ha, no worries
13:29  sitaktif_: but jsquared just read   :h CTRL-W
13:29  FernandoBasso: I learned something. Thanks.
13:30  sitaktif_: <c-w> has no effect by itself, by default. It waits for another stroke
13:30  sitaktif_: FernandoBasso: :)
13:30  FernandoBasso: It enters in 'window mode', correct?
13:30  sitaktif_: it's not  mode
13:30  FernandoBasso: haha
13:31  sitaktif_: it's just that these are multiple stroke mappings
13:31  FernandoBasso: I just implemented one more mode in vim.
13:31  jsquared: sitaktif_: Yes, I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. But doesn't ^W^W simply advance to the next window?
13:31  jsquared: At least that is the behavior I experience.
13:31  sitaktif_: CTRL-W_W|CTRL-W wooden    go to N previous window (wrap around)
13:31  sitaktif_: read help !!
13:31  peth: yes, it isn't the "previous" window in the sense of last accessed
13:31  sitaktif_: yes it does
13:31  sitaktif_: :)
13:32  sitaktif_: peth: I was not talking to you (just avoiding confusion)
13:32  sitaktif_: :)
13:32  peth: no one ever talks to me :'(
13:33  sitaktif_: ohhhh
13:33  FernandoBasso: Let's make a pause of 1 minute untill each one of us talk!
13:33  sitaktif_: I just did !
13:33  peth: oh right
13:33  peth: :/
13:33  Kunda: how do you 'redo' after you 'undo' ?
13:33  peth: :)

13:35  bracki: What's your favourite remap for CTRL-w w?
13:36  spiiph: Why would one remap that?
13:36  sitaktif_: -
13:36  bracki: Because I use it every five minutes...
13:36  sitaktif_: (yeah I know it's bad, but I answered the question :) )
13:36  bracki: spiiph: How do you switch between windows?
13:37  spiiph: <C-w>w, but I don't remap it
13:38  sitaktif_: bracki: you can use ' for example  (I always use ` for jump)
13:38  sitaktif_: bracki: spiiph is very consercative :)
13:38  sitaktif_: v*
13:38  peth: i use <C-Space> or <C-@>
13:38  spiiph: bracki, you can just double hit <C-w><C-w>
13:39  bracki: Yeah but I prefer not to hit ctrl at all
13:39  FernandoBasso: How could I make vim open a help file in a script line?
13:39  bracki: What about PgUp/PgDOwn?
13:40  Kunda: What do folks map their Caps Lock to ?
13:40  bracki: Esc
13:41  peth: same
13:41  FernandoBasso: Simpler than I thought: tab help pattern.txt
13:41  Kunda: interesting idea
13:41  peth: some people like ctrl there, but i find i don't really need three of those
13:41  Kunda: how is it working on other machines after becoming habituated to that ?
13:42  peth: i map that everywhere i can
13:42  peth: but it isn't too bad if not
13:42  bracki: Kunda: awful
13:42  peth: much worse is my ctrl/alt swapping
13:43  Kunda: mapping it to Esc seems more ergonomical...you know ?
13:44  peth: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_Terminal_ADM3A.svg
13:45  peth: that's the layout bill joy did vi on
13:45  Kunda: woah, reality shift
13:46  Kunda: interesting..anyone here use this mapping ?
13:46  peth: no way
13:46  Kunda: hehe

14:46  blaa: how can I add a tab in multiple lines?
14:46  blaa: I'm trying to select a text block in visual mode
14:47  blaa: but is not working
14:47  daniel: blaa: ^VjjjI<Tab><Esc><wait two seconds>
14:47  daniel: ah, no waiting needed for I
14:47  iaj: ok so now what's wrong about that... i want to get everything from the third ; onwards....
14:48  iaj: /\([^;]*;\)\{3}.*$/
14:48  blaa: daniel let me try
14:48  daniel: iaj: Maybe put an ^ at the front
14:49  iaj: daniel: its still highlighting everything. :(
14:49  blaa: daniel doesn't work
14:49  blaa: hum
14:49  daniel: blaa: it does work
14:50  blaa: when i type I
14:50  blaa: the visual selection is gone
14:50  daniel: blaa: of course
14:51  daniel: iaj: that's because the first part still belongs to the matching
14:51  daniel: *match
14:51  iaj: ohh.. how can I simply match the part AFTER the 3;s?
14:51  daniel: iaj: if it's possible at all, you have to reverse your term and start searching backwards
14:52  daniel: iaj: do you really want a search, or do you want a substitute?
14:52  iaj: daniel: or put a \zs at the end no?
14:52  blaa: I don't know what am I doing wrong
14:52  blaa: but is not working
14:52  blaa: =/
14:52  iaj: daniel: well Im going to reduce all lines to only that thing there
14:52  daniel: iaj: put the .* part in \(\) then and substitute with \2
14:53  iaj: daniel: yeah worked :)
14:53  iaj: thanks
14:53  daniel: :%s/\([^;]*;\)\{3}\(.*\)$/\2/
14:53  daniel: i guess that's pong in pearl
14:53  daniel: blaa: Just type in exactly what i said
14:57  blaa: daniel yes, when I type "I", the selection is gone and the <tab> just affects one single line
14:57  daniel: blaa: Until  you press <Escape>, then the tab is inserted into every line
15:00  Kunda: just discovered vimperator
15:01  blaa: daniel worked with visual block, ctrl+v
15:01  blaa: I don't know why doesn't worked with ^V
15:02  daniel: ^V _is_ ctrl+v
15:02  blaa: ^V = VISUAL LINE ctrl+V = VISUAL BLOCK, is it equivalent?
15:02  daniel: ^ means control
15:02  blaa: oh
15:03  daniel: and I does not work in visual mode, since it would be useless
15:03  blaa: crap, thank you daniel
15:03  daniel: you're welcome
15:23  abhijeet: how to trun off the mouse when tying inside vim
15:23  FernandoBasso: abhijeet: :set mouse-=a
15:24  FernandoBasso: Or perhaps, make a function that detects modes, and turn mouse off when in insert mode.
15:25  FernandoBasso: In my opinion, it's best not to use the mouse at all.
15:25  abhijeet: I d't want to completely turn off it just turn off during the typing..
15:25  abhijeet: bcuz it got clicked on tracking pad and
15:26  abhijeet: my typing is started at the clicked line
15:26  FernandoBasso: That happens to me as well, in other programs.
15:26  FernandoBasso: There must be a tip on this subject.
15:26  abhijeet: do u have any idea??
15:26  peter_w: it's not vim specific
15:27  abhijeet: it is getting very difficult to type on laptops.
15:27  abhijeet: i did not found such issues on windows
15:28  abhijeet: is it a linux tracking pad issue
15:28  peter_w: the synaptics driver can do it
15:28  abhijeet: earier i used synaptic but now it is not required so i have not install it
15:31  mail: why would a leader mapping persist even after removing it from _vimrc
15:31  mail: and sourcing
15:32  peter_w: why would it not
15:33  FernandoBasso: mail: I've heard that :source $MYVIMRC is not always enough.
15:33  FernandoBasso: I don't remember who have told me that, though.
15:33  rson: just because you source your vimrc doesn't mean it removes things that were previously defined.  you must unmap it.
15:33  FernandoBasso: rson: You are right.
15:34  mail: can i see all mappings somehow?
15:34  rson: :map
15:35  FernandoBasso: I am configuring Project. CD=. is the path of My_Project=~/Projects/secrectProject/ ?
15:38 * penguin42 is playing with autocmds and vim scripts for the first time and am a little confused;   in the following shouldn't afile expand to the file - I suspect the issue is when the expansion is done autocmd BufNewFile *:[0-9][0-9]* echo "<afile>"     that's actually giving me the string <afile>, without the "'s it's giving me invalid expression
15:40  strull: penguin42: you want echo expand("<afile>")
15:41  penguin42: strull: Thanks - that's worked nicely!  Can you explain why? Is that performing the expansion at the time of execution of the command rather than definition?
15:41  strull: sure, at execution time. Else it wouldn't make much sense
15:42  penguin42: Great, thanks
15:42  strull: np, have fun!
15:49  sie: How do I do inverted search?
15:49  FernandoBasso: N
15:49  FernandoBasso: Upper case. Or ?pattern
15:50  sie: No, that is last occorurence, backwards, no?
15:50  sie: occourence*
15:50  FernandoBasso: ?pattern searches pattern backwards.
15:50  FernandoBasso: Perhaps you just want n and N
15:50  sie: INVERTED, nto backwards.
15:51  phw: Is there a way to auto-linebreak files (latex) so that here is really a newline? (what :set wrap does but not only visual)
15:51  sie: FernandoBasso, I want to find a line that doesn't match }$
15:52  spiiph: phw, :h 'tw
15:52  peter_w: sie: so create a pattern that doesn't match lines with }$
15:52  sie: Oh, right. I'm dumb. ;-D Still something that'd do that automatically would be lovely.
15:53  sie: Cause the anti-pattern is twice as large.
15:54  rson: sie: i'd suggest using :v/pattern/
15:54  rson: it's different than a search, but more useful
15:54  peter_w: rson: that won't "find a line"
15:55  phw: spiiph: thank you very much, it works perfect now!
15:55  rson: right, it would find all lines
15:57  cizra: Hi. I'm trying to open a text file of unknown quality in GVim, on Windwoes. When I do :e ++enc=ucs2-le, it says [NOT converted], but (for example) Notepad opens it just fine. What might be the cause? Illegal characters in the text file? Bad Vim configuration?
15:59  sie: Just use notepad. It's the bong.
16:03  berserkerxiii: last night, i dreamt of colons
16:04  penguin42: did you :w before you woke up?
16:05  berserkerxiii: seeing as i dont remember much, probably no.
16:05  cizra: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Gray1223.png -- colon
16:05  sie: 1003.53 berserkerxiii ‖ last night, i dreamt of colons
16:05  sie: 1004.14     penguin42 ‖ did you :w before you woke up?
16:05  sie: derp, wrong channel
16:05  cizra: "Orifice of vermiform process", hmmmm
16:05  berserkerxiii: cizra: hehe not that colon
16:06  yano: :
16:18  aero_: hey guys, i'm trying to do a regex replace in vim but it keeps telling me that the pattern was not found (e486). here's the regex: /[0-9]{3}/
16:19  FernandoBasso: aero_: \{3}
16:19  aero_: FernandoBasso: ahh, thanks. didn't know i needed to escape that. thanks
16:19  tangledhelix: FernandoBasso: you only have to quote the opening brace?
16:19  FernandoBasso: Yes.
16:20  tangledhelix: is that true generally, e.g. with ( ) and such?
16:20  FernandoBasso: It is not like groups \(I_am_a_group\) Where you scape ( and ) \(...\)
16:20  tangledhelix: ah ok, that's what threw me. thanks
16:20  FernandoBasso: Or delimiting the start or end of words \< and \>
16:37  mail: anyone know good place for premade snippets for snipmate?
16:47  mail: TIL i learned about r in VIM
16:47  mail: awesome
16:51  FernandoBasso: mail: Still, snippets are very useful.
16:51  mail: yes they are
16:51  FernandoBasso: mail: What do you code?
16:51  mail: just can't be bothered making my own occam snippets :P
16:52  FernandoBasso: snipMate makes creating snippets extremely easy.
16:53  etcetera: is there a way to make vim "autocompletion" more like visual studio's "intellisense"
16:53  mail: autocomplop
16:53  mail: i think is good
16:59  mail: etcetera
16:59  mail: http://blogs.gnome.org/lharris/2008/07/20/code-completion-with-vim-7/
16:59  mail: look at that
