00:57  homekevin: frogonwheels: I'm sort-of sure I've seen that happen in other channels.
00:57  frogonwheels: homekevin: sure - it depends on the bot.
00:57  Luiji99: I have /* vim: set sts=2 sw=2 et: */, but it still inserts normal tabs.
00:57  frogonwheels: Luiji99:   :set sts? sw? et?
00:58  homekevin: Luiji99: modelines might not be enabled.
00:58  Luiji99: How do I enable modelines?
00:58  frogonwheels: Luiji99: :help 'modelines
00:58 --- Channel #vim was synced in 90 seconds
00:58  homekevin: also :h 'modeline'
00:58  frogonwheels: Luiji99:   and look above it at 'modeline
00:58  frogonwheels: :)
00:59  homekevin: nomodeline is set on Debian and derivatives.
00:59  Somelauw: I tried using vim on windoze.
00:59  frogonwheels: and some distros set modeline=0   just to be b*
01:00  Somelauw: My keyboard is set to US-international
01:00  Somelauw: But accents don't work.
01:00  frogonwheels: Somelauw: you need to set encoding to utf-8
01:00 --- TheBrayn_ is now known as TheBrayn
01:00  Somelauw: For example when I press ' followed by e, it should print Ã©.
01:00  frogonwheels: Somelauw:   :set encoding?  fencs?
01:00  Somelauw: :set encoding=utf-8
01:01  homekevin: vimgor: modeline is <reply> See :h 'modeline'. On Debian and some of its derivatives, modeline is turned off in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim for security reasons.
01:01  vimgor: Got it, homekevin.
01:01  Luiji99: So I should use /* vim: set sts=2 sw=2: */ instead of /* vim: set sts=2 sw=2 et: */ to get eight spaces converted to a tab?
01:02  frogonwheels: vimgor: no modeline is <reply>  See :h 'modeline'. On Debian and some of its derivatives, modeline is turned off in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim for security reasons. Some distros also set modelines=0 just to be painful!
01:02  vimgor: I hear ya.
01:02  homekevin: Luiji99: You still need ts=8 and noet, I think.
01:02  Luiji99: I'll do some playing around.
01:03  Luiji99: I don't think ts=8 would be *required*, but would make everything look right on all VIMs.
01:03  homekevin: Luiji99: Well, Vim needs to know that you want 8-column tabs.
01:03  Luiji99: ok
01:03  homekevin: If you want tabs to be used for the level 4 indent.
01:04  Luiji99: I'm going to go for /* vim: set ts=8 sts=2 sw=2 noet: */.
01:04  Luiji99: Modelines=heaven.
01:04  frogonwheels: Luiji99: bleah..  but your choice :)
01:04  homekevin: Luiji99: To get exactly what you want, this is what my indent plugin does: setl ts=8 sw=2 sts=2 noet
01:05  homekevin: Looks like the same as what you've got.
01:05  frogonwheels: Luiji99: I find noet indenting stypes  where  ts<>sw  awful
01:05  azi`: is there any way I could add the line number (starting from 1) directly into the text file? i was thinking about something in the lines of %s/^/LINENUMBER+1 but don't know if regex is capable of that
01:05  Luiji99: homekevin: Is that actually supposed to be setl or set?
01:05  frogonwheels: Luiji99: .. and that includes vim source (ts=8 sw=4)
01:06  homekevin: Luiji99: One more thing, check out :h 'ts'. It has useful info. It really is supposed to be setl[ocal]
01:06  Luiji99: frogonwheels: What exactly don't you like? The replacing 8 spaces with tabs or..?
01:06  homekevin: I hate mixing tabs and spaces.
01:06  Somelauw: :set et
01:06  homekevin: Oh, I do. ;{
01:06  homekevin: ;)
01:06  Luiji99: I do to, but the GNU Indent likes that way of doing things.
01:07  Luiji99: And I follow standards like my life depends on it.
01:07  Luiji99: I'm a bit OCD.
01:07  homekevin: GNU has some crazy-ass style guidelines.
01:07  Luiji99: I like some of them.
01:07  Luiji99: *some*
01:08 * Luiji99 wants to emphasize *not all*
01:08  homekevin: But hey, indenting before *and* after a { is so awesome!
01:08  Luiji99: Very true.
01:08  homekevin: Why have one indent when you can have 2?
01:09  homekevin: I like to just indent each new line.
01:11  homekevin: Here's a question, though. In modelines, does 'set' still change the global value? Or are modeline sets implicitly setlocals?
01:11  Luiji99: I added "modeline on" to ~/.vimrc, and now it says "You are stupid for doing that." whenever I open a new Vim instance.
01:11  homekevin: Wow.
01:11  homekevin: What OS, Luiji99?
01:11  Luiji99: openSUSE Linux
01:11  Luiji99: I think I need to write "set modeline on".
01:12  homekevin: Maybe they also added an option to shut it up?
01:12  homekevin: Luiji99: I don't think that's right.
01:12  homekevin: It should be :set modeline
01:12  homekevin: (Of course you don't need the : in .vimrc, I say it that way to be clear that it's a : command)
01:12  Luiji99: Ah...there we go.
01:13  Luiji99: $ echo 'set modeline' > .vimrc
01:13  Luiji99: Thanks for the help!
01:13  homekevin: echo blah > .vimrc only if you really don't care about your .vimrc.
01:15  homekevin: I wonder what was actually happening when Luiji99 had "modeline on"? That should just be a "Not an editor command" error.
01:16  homekevin: I guess Luiji99 was probably embellishing.
01:16  homekevin: I thought Vim had actually been patched to call the user stupid if they turned on modeline.
01:16  homekevin: I can be very literal.

02:37  jerojasro: I'm using pathogen. When opening a tex file, I see that the tex ftplugin files are being sourced before the plugin files. any hints on why this might be happening?
02:41  jerojasro: actually, this happens not only with tex files, but with any kind of file; the ftplugin vim files are being loaded before the plugin files
02:43  rson: jerojasro: :help after
02:55  jerojasro: rson: the order of the list of places that vim checks for runtime files shown in that help page is the one vim really uses?

03:05  jamessan: jerojasro: plugin/ files are loaded when Vim first starts. ftplugin/ files are loaded when Vim loads a buffer and detects its filetype.  I'm not sure I can see a situation where ftplugin/ would be loaded before plugin/
03:06  jerojasro: jamessan: yeah. I've just checked and in, say, the root account here, the plugin files are loaded before the ftplugin files
03:07  jerojasro: but that's not what is happening in my user account
03:07 * jerojasro goes back to stare at :scriptnames ...
03:12  jerojasro: jamessan: just found the culprit. The checkattach.vim plugin
03:17  jerojasro: yep, it is a plugin, and calls 'filetype detect' when sourced
03:28  jamessan: jerojasro: that sounds like a bug
03:31  jerojasro: I think the same.https://github.com/chrisbra/CheckAttach/issues/issue/1
03:31  jerojasro: just reported
03:35  SpookyET: Hi. I would to write all files to disk when vim loses focus except read only and no name buffers.
03:36  robgleeson: does anyone know of a vim plugin to align the colon in CSS?
03:38  rbarraud: strull_: tried *lots* of escapes already :-/ - no help
03:40  Sonja: vim is neat.
03:40  jamessan: SpookyET: au FocusLost * bufdo if !empty(bufname('%')) && !&ro | update | endif
03:40  Sonja: i'm going to stick to arrow keys instead of vi-movement
03:40  jamessan: SpookyET: you may also want 'autowrite'
03:41  new_one: is it possible to switch j and k in navigation? I find j more intuitive in moving up and k down
03:41  strull_: rbarraud: what exactly is your problem?
03:42  SpookyET: jamessan autowrite?
03:43  jamessan: SpookyET: :help 'autowrite   just figured if you want files written out when Vim loses focus, you may also be interested in the scenarios the 'autowrite' option covers
03:44  tos9: How would one move lockstep down two windows at once? (i.e. not in vimdiff)?
03:45  jamessan: tos9: :help 'scrollbind   if you're using 7.3, :help 'cursorbind  too
03:47  SpookyET: jamessan: Thank you.
03:47  tos9: jamessan, awesome. thank you kindly!
03:49  jamessan: jerojasro: checkattach specifically supports being used with more than just the mail filetype.  that's why it's not just installed as an ftplugin
03:51  jerojasro: vimgor: align
03:51  vimgor: There are some plugins used to align text in a buffer. Align.vim is the most popular, but I've heard around that godlygeek's Tabular is a much better alternative, ask me about 'Tabular' for more info.
03:51  new_one: never mind my question, I'll just learn j and k :)
03:51  SpookyET: jamessan: Wondering why it outputs "[No Name]" [+] 1 line --100%-- when I switch away from vim.
03:51  jerojasro: vimgor: Tabular
03:51  vimgor: Tabular is godlygeek's plugin to align text in vim, http://github.com/godlygeek/tabular
03:52  peth: excellent choice, new_one
03:53  jamessan: SpookyET: because of the bufdo.  you probably want to use :silent
03:53  jamessan: SpookyET: au FocusLost * silent bufdo if !empty(bufname('%')) && !&ro | update | endif
03:53  strull_: new_one: good idea
03:54  rbarraud: strull_: I am in an xterm session with vim running ; i accidentally hit ^X-^S to save (i.e. the Emacs save command :-/ )
03:54  strull_: rbarraud: press contrl-q
03:54  rbarraud: now the bottom status bar shows ^X-mode and it is unreqponsive
03:55  rbarraud: thanks i will try that
03:55  strull_: ^s will pause your terminal
03:55  SpookyET: jamessan: sweet. thank you
03:56  rbarraud: that worked - thanks -- and of course ^S does --- shoulda spotted that one myself :) Thanks!!
03:56  strull_: np, have fun!
03:59  jerojasro: jamessan: you're right; but it is trashing the sourcing-order nonetheless

16:12  Fernandos: ah.. gdb.. someone in c laughed about the fact that I don't know howto debug c.. and mentioned gdb but I didn't know howto use it

16:50  ezuk: Hi everyone!
16:51  ezuk: I'm having some problems using FTP with gvim under Win7 x64.
16:51  ezuk: Was wondering if anyone might be able to help.
16:54  Fernandos: do you use ftp within vim ?
16:54  ezuk: That's what I'm trying to do, yes
16:54  Fernandos: I'd recomment winscp for that..
16:54  Fernandos: simpler and it works
16:55  ezuk: Really? FTP is known to be problematic in vim?
16:55  ezuk: I mean, vim for windows
16:55  Fernandos: just open a file in winscp with gvim for windows and start editing.. it shuold autoupload upon save
16:55  ezuk: That's what most guys do?
16:55  Fernandos: nah
16:55  ezuk: (I just don't like using extra apps if I can do it within vim)
16:55  ezuk: What's the "normal" solution for Windows?
16:56  Fernandos: I think most guys have a git repo they work in and commit inside/outside git.. you can have an ftp hook in git if you want
16:57  ezuk: Ah, I see... I'm just trying to update some html on a static web server.
16:57  Fernandos: well why don't you map a network drive to v:/
16:58  ezuk: I don't want all apps to be able to access this FTP directory.
16:58  ezuk: It's actually kind of working now in vim. I don't know, it's pretty random...
16:59  Fernandos: ezuk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/614088/effective-use-of-gvim-over-a-network
16:59  ezuk: Funny, I've read this thread earlier today
16:59  Fernandos: haha
16:59  ezuk: my admin won't let me ssh into the server...
17:00  ezuk: I have just ftp access.
17:01  Fernandos: :e ftp://[user]@[hostname]/file
17:01  ezuk: Yup
17:01  ezuk: That's what I did, and it does work atm. But sometimes it doesn't. Sorry, I know that sounds lame... I will come in again with an error message next time it breaks.
17:01  ezuk: I do appreciate your help Fernandos.
17:02  Fernandos: ezuk: if you work in subdirs you probably need to use a double slash to edit a file.
17:02  Fernandos: like :e ftp://[user]@[hostname]//subdir//file
17:03  Fernandos: n/p dude :)
17:03  ezuk: Really? why the escaping?
17:03  Fernandos: idk, it's weird.. I think vim thinks / is part of the filename
17:04  ezuk: You also use gvim on windows?

17:25  bosie: jamessan: haven't used tabs yet. but :tab h just removed all my windows in the current tab and opened a window with help
17:25  bosie: guess i should always read the help section of a command before executing it ;)
17:25  strull_: you can also :he , then :sp and navigate in the two windows
17:25  jamessan: bosie: :tab h should have openend a new tab with one window showing the help topic you specified

17:26  siddhion: im trying to figure out VIMs FTP plugin. In one article it says to use 'vim ftp://username@yourdomain.com//the/path/to/yourfile.php'. What does 'use' mean? Put in the .vimrc ? or....
17:26  bosie: strull_: you mean :sp and then :he no?
17:27  strull_: no
17:27  jamessan: siddhion: it means use that command to start vim
17:27  jamessan: siddhion: alternatively, you can start Vim and then do ":e ftp://...."
17:27  bosie: strull_: anyways, thanks for the suggestion
17:28  strull_: np, have fun!
17:28  siddhion: jamessan, i see but then what about the password to log into the server?
17:28  bosie: strull_: vim ain't fun, its hard work ;)
17:28  jamessan: bosie: if you :help, Vim opens a help window.  if you then :sp that help window, then issuing :help commands when one of those windows is focused will change the help topic in that window
17:29  jamessan: siddhion: you'll get prompted to enter it.  Vim also understands .netrc files.  :help netrw-netrc
17:29  bosie: jamessan: well yes, i just thought that splitting first would make more sense but ok. outcome is the same
17:29  strull_: bosie: not at all
17:29  siddhion: jamessan, ok i will try these methods. thanks
17:30  bosie: strull_: hard work you mean?
17:30  strull_: same outcome I mean
17:30  jamessan: bosie: splitting first doesn't work because a :help command will only create a new window if there isn't an existing help window, so you'd still end up with only one help window
17:30  bosie: oh yes, you are right
17:30  bosie: i had a help window open
17:39  siddhion: jamessan, i am reading up on .netrc but I can not locate it in my home directory when I do 'ls -a'
17:40  siddhion: jamessan, can it be some where else or perhaps should I create a new file named .netrc?

18:13  Somelauw: But I still don't know how to remove spaces.
18:13  Somelauw: Or how to deal with them.
18:26  homekevin: Somelauw: fnameescape?
18:28  homekevin: I guess it might depend on what you are trying to do. "a problem with spaces" isn't very specifi.
18:28  homekevin: *specific.
18:28  timemachine3030: Is there a way to make an empty Locations window close when using :lw ... that same way as the Quixfix window does when using :cw ?
18:29  Somelauw: Okay the problem was that if I do :!file with space
18:29  Somelauw: file is called with "with space" as arguments.
18:29  homekevin: timemachine3030: :lclose?
18:29  Somelauw: When I did :!%:p
18:29  Somelauw: I solved it by doing :!"%:p"

18:31  timemachine3030: all good.
18:32  homekevin: Huh, the docs seem to indicate that :lw works the same as :cw
18:33  timemachine3030: homekevin, yes. but that is not the case.
18:35  Somelauw: Okay, that works as well. I wonder if both codes are exactly equivalent.

19:32  jamessan: if you're able to generate tags for your project, I'd imagine there's a script out there that will setup syntax highlighting based on the tags

19:40  DHulme: what language are you talking about?
19:40  bassliner: actually i edit a tcl script.
19:41  DHulme: and what do tcl comments look like?
19:42  Raging_Hog: egn: perhaps make an :autocommand that adds the function name to highlighted ones? You'd of course have to run it during startup, too
19:43  Raimondi_: bassliner: >> indents a comment here.
19:43 --- Raimondi_ is now known as Raimondi
19:44  DHulme: Raimondi: actually, it does here too, even with ft=tcl
19:45  DHulme: must be some user setting or plugin
19:45  Raimondi: DHulme: Yeah, that's the usual suspect :)
19:45  jamessan: bassliner: you have either 'smartindent' on or 'cindent' on and # in 'cinkeys'
19:46  DHulme: aha
19:46  jamessan: bassliner: ":verbose set smartindent? cindent? cinkeys?"
19:46  DHulme: that's the other usual suspect
19:47  Luiji99: Is there a way to disable automatic indentation?
19:48  bassliner: jamessan: unfortunately that had no effect. :-/
19:48  DHulme: bassliner: you were supposed to tell us the output
19:48  DHulme: sorry if that wasn't clear
19:48  jamessan: bassliner: it wasn't supposed to. if you typed it like I said, it should have just shown the current values for those options
19:50  bassliner: jamessan: i tried it like ":set cindent"
19:51  mhi^: bassliner: write everything he wrote between the double quotes (yes, including the '?')
19:51  mhi^: but, close and restart vim before, since you altered the settings by now
19:52  bassliner: mhi^: well i just tried it in command mode with all those 3 single settings.
19:52  jamessan: bassliner: there was a reason I quoted the entire string and not just parts of it ;)
19:52  jamessan: bassliner: you're supposed to type exactly what I typed
19:53  bassliner: jamessan: that gives me this here: http://fpaste.org/w86Q/
19:53  jamessan: bassliner: right, don't set smartindent
19:54  mhi^: common mistake among beginner, on the other side, it provides it pretty quick way to query current option values :)
19:54  jamessan: vimgor: smartindent
19:54  vimgor: Don't you mean stupidindent? In all seriousness, 'smartindent' is an obsolete option for C-like syntax. It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype indent on' and be happy.
19:57  mhi^: jamessan: will we ever see your current vimrc? :)
19:57 * mhi^ tries not to get on his nerves ;<
19:58  bassliner: jamessan, mhi, DHulme, vimgor: thanks a lot.
19:58  jamessan: *shrug* I don't really find it useful to look at other people's vimrc files so I don't have a lot of motivation for publishing mine (aside from actually having my configs under version control)
20:00  mhi^: If you ever change your mind, you could provide it as 'expert vimrc example' with the Vim package ;)
20:01  jamessan: there's an old version up on my gitweb instance, but I've been "working" on getting all of my config files under version control and as such haven't updated that repo
20:01  bosie: jamessan: i would like a peek at our vimrc though ;)
20:01  jamessan: mhi^: well, you could look at the vimrc files of some of the other regulars here for that
20:02  mhi^: Did that already, apart from 2 or 3 people. Well, the ones I could find on github :)
20:02  bosie: mhi^: whom you found?
20:03  mhi^: jamessan: But you're right, configs are somewhat personal, I agree with this. "Vim workflows" are much more interesting to me nowadays, since a lot of people seem to use a lot of different approaches. (Depending of their kind of work, of course.)
20:05  bosie: mhi^: found interesting blog posts/book sections/... about vim workflows?
20:07  mhi^: not yet, really.. just started caring about it 2 days ago when talking to MetaCosm_ ;)
20:07  bosie: yea MetaCosm_ left an impression ;)
20:09 * mhi^ likes his new scratchpad toggle function ;p
20:11  bosie: scratchpad?
20:11  Somelauw: Is there a way to scroll through large amounts of vim output?
20:13  mhi^: bosie: http://codepad.org/V7CZu2KN
20:20  bosie: thanks
20:29  iElectric: still no idea how to make %m in errorformat span through multilines
20:35  jerojasro: Somelauw: >messages
20:35  jerojasro: err
20:35  jerojasro: :messages
20:36  Raimondi: iElectric: Have you seens  :h errorformat-multi-line  ?
20:38  iElectric: Raimondi: yeah, I can't decypher it
20:39  iElectric: Raimondi: I need to say message might be in the same line or three lines long
20:47  Somelauw: jerojasro, no, I don't want messages. I want to see the output when I use the commandline from within vim.
20:47  Somelauw: :! comman_with_long_output
20:49  peth: Somelauw: you can read that output into a buffer with :r !cmd
21:14  Somelauw: Wouldn't that write the output of the command on top of my precious source code.
21:14  Somelauw: ?
21:19 --- paradig is now known as paradigm
21:22  RusAlex: how to close (delete from editing buffers) buffer if it's in splitted window, but not close a window ? if i have 2 splitted windows, and if i press :bd<CR> , this window also became closed, i want only close delete buffer from this window, but not close window
21:23 --- sid3k` is now known as sid3k
21:24  RusAlex: guys, anyone can help me ?
21:25  peth: Somelauw: it would a- or prepend the output to the current buffer, yes. this seems to be a solution: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Display_output_of_shell_commands_in_new_window
21:36  peth: RusAlex: there is no such thing as an empty window in vim. if you want to keep the split, just change to the buffer you want to edit.
21:37  peth: if you really, really want the previous buffer gone after that, use :bd#
21:37  RusAlex: peth: will try now !
21:37  RusAlex: so that's not good bd#
21:38  RusAlex: i need new map key. map <f1> :bn<cr>:bd <previous buffer number><cr> can you help ?
21:40  peth: RusAlex: nmap <F1> :bn<bar>bd#<CR> should do it
21:42  RusAlex: is bar is space ?
21:42  RusAlex: if space i have error Traling characters
21:42  peth: you enter that just like it is there, type each < and >
21:43  peth: <Bar> will be replaced with | for the mapping, which strings commands together
21:43  RusAlex: Ð½ÑÑ
21:43  RusAlex: yes
21:43  RusAlex: peth: XOXOXO =)
21:44  peth: :)
21:44  Ratty_: Hi, is there a work around for the 223 column limit for xterm mouse support?
21:44  Ratty_: Is the protocol going to be updated?
21:47  iElectric: so when override (!) is given, no variable is set that one would check?
22:04  singlecore: hi all
22:05  singlecore: any1 know how to change the color of that default pinky completion box ?
22:10  sh1mmer: trying to understand a vim concept
22:10  sh1mmer: does map let me define new "atoms"
22:10  sh1mmer: like w is word
22:10  sh1mmer: I can use map to define new things to use with movement commands, etc?
22:11  Raimondi: singlecore: :h highlight-groups
22:11  peth: singlecore: :h highlight-groups, see Pmenu et al
22:11  peth: hrm
22:12  Raimondi: sh1mmer: I think you're looking for this:  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Creating_new_text_objects
22:12  sh1mmer: Raimondi: as always, you are awesome
22:13  sh1mmer: Raimondi: if you have an amazon wishlist or a favourite charity let me know :)
22:13  singlecore: Raimondi, peth thx
22:14  Raimondi: sh1mmer: Seems like I was right this time :)
22:32  __ls: what's the easiest way to align (already typed) code at the equal (=) sign?
22:33  LeoNerd: Use one of the 10,000 align plugins
22:33  Raimondi: vimgor: align
22:33  vimgor: There are some plugins used to align text in a buffer. Align.vim is the most popular, but I've heard around that godlygeek's Tabular is a much better alternative, ask me about 'Tabular' for more info.
22:33  Raimondi: __ls: ^
22:34  __ls: so no straightforward way without using one of the plugins
22:34  __ls: thanks everyone
22:43  frogonwheels: __ls: use the program
22:43  frogonwheels: __ls: sorry .. um  what language?
22:44  frogonwheels: __ls: = will apply whatever indenting rules vim has been set up with.
22:44  Noble: How can I make "r!calc 2+2" input in to the same line, and not the one below?
22:47  peth: Noble: do you want to replace the line?
22:47  __ls: frogonwheels: it's c. you mean typing ":="? that didn't do the trick, but then again, i dunno what indention rules are set right now.
22:50  __ls: arg! different issue: how the heck can i avoid that when i paste sth into vim with middle mouse click that the pasted code is messed up? i.e. each line is further indented than the one before. i did :set noautoindent and :set nosmartindent
22:50  homekevin: frogonwheels, __ls, I think you had a little communication mix-up there. __ls is talking about = in the code and frogonwheels is talking about Vim's = command.
22:51  __ls: homekevin: frogonwheels, corrct, i meant aligning at the character = in the code
22:52  frogonwheels: __ls: plugin.
22:52  __ls: frogonwheels: but then again, i did it by hand now, because i don't want to bother with plugins
23:04  Noble: peth: No, just input.
23:04  peth: Noble: try ":.-1r !cmd" then
23:05  Noble: peth: ty
23:06  peth: oh, :-1r works, too
23:09  homekevin: I kind of wish there was a way to incremental-search, then stop when I find what I was looking for without replacing my current search term.
23:10  homekevin: I guess maybe what I really need is several active searches. That might be nice.
23:11  homekevin: Or a more convenient way to activate the previous 1 or 2 searches.
23:11  singlecore: did i say that i love this editor today?
23:12  homekevin: singlecore: If you don't sometimes hate it I think you are doing it wrong. ;)
23:12  singlecore: ^^
23:12  singlecore: but rite now im lovin it
23:23  walt: homekevin: that, is so true. Vim can be such a bitch sometimes
23:27  frogonwheels: homekevin: well there's script support for getting at your search history :)
23:30  MetaCosm: ... my firefox loading time is starting to feel so crusty
