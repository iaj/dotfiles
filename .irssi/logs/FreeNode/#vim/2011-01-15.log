00:00  chalcedony: heh vimdiff is what i wanted :)
00:01  sente: heh, reasonable :p
00:02  chalcedony: when it shows like this : + +-- 93 lines: 3. 2009-08-19wheelchai   does that mean they are ok or missing or?
00:02  spiiph: folded = equal
00:12  chalcedony: spiiph, thanks :)
00:29  Adman65: what does '<c-_>b' mean in vimese?
00:31  spiiph: That looks odd.
00:31  spiiph: But CTRL+_ and then b
00:31  Adman65: it's from the tcomment plugin
01:05  dans: i'm struggling with pasting into vim
01:05  dans: from things i've copied outside of vim, say on a webpage
01:05  dans: anything special i need to bear in mind?
01:05  dans: i'm pressing p
01:08  rson: dans: you need to paste from the * or + register.  "*p or "+p
01:09  rson: dans: vim's internal copying isn't done using the clipboard or primary selection by default, you must explicitly tell it to use them.
01:09  mahlon: And to avoid wrapping while pasting, :set paste
01:09  rson: dans: see :help quotestar and :help quoteplus
01:13  Random832: i had shift-insert mapped to it forever [taken from the win32 behavior], had to unlearn that [my new 'go-to' clipboard paste key sequence is "+P]
01:14  Random832: you know what would be nice? a 'clipboard server' that vim, screen, and a windows machine could all participate in
01:22  cosmodad: Is it possible to remap ALT- or CMD-combos on the terminal version of vim in Mac OS X? I tried "map <A-Right> :bnext<CR>" but it's not working (neither is <D-Right>)
01:23  dans: rson, great thanks
01:24  dans: once i'm in help, ho do i exit :/
01:24  bairui: :q
01:25  bairui: or :close
01:27  dans: ah yeah, i thought that might close the whole window
01:27  dans: but nope
01:27  bairui: it does
01:31  dans: bairui, but i mean i had help open but my code was visible underneath....i thought it would close my code
01:33  bairui: yeah, i know. :) I was pointing out that the help opens up in its own window. That's why   :quit  and  :close   work. Their behaviour are slightly different when the help window is the last visible window.
01:36  dans: one more thing, i want to configure my indentation etc
01:36  dans: commands like set expandtab
01:36  dans: where do i put them?
01:36  dans: is there a config file, and can i enter it from within vim?
01:36  bairui: in your ~/.vimrc
01:36  bairui: :help vimrc
01:36  dans: i can't see a .vimrc in my home directory, and yes i have unhidden the files
01:37  bairui: that's ok - you need to make it
01:37  dans: i hope i haven't installed it somewhere else
01:37  dans: aah
01:37  dans: ok :)
01:37  bairui: for a starter vimrc, have a look at the one in https://github.com/dahu/LearnVim
01:38  dans: thanks

02:31  djerome: I found the same problem here: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.editors.vim/93730
02:31  djerome: hap!
02:31  djerome: err, help!
02:40  peth: djerome: well, did you install the build dependencies?
02:45  nhak: do i have to enter insert mode to move the cursor ... it is somehow inconvenient to me
02:48  nhak: hey do i have to enter insert mode to move the cursor? ... it is somehow inconvenient to me
02:49  dindinx: nhak: this is quite the opposite
02:49  PhilB: You can only move it (at least, without the arrow keys) in normal mode, not insert mode.
02:50  dindinx: nhak: leaving the insert mode let you moving the cursor in many ways.
02:50  lucs:  
02:51  dindinx: vimgor: motion
02:51  vimgor: Wish I knew, dindinx.
02:52  peth: vimgor: movement
02:52  vimgor: In normal mode, all of these keys can move the cursor: ` # $ % ^ * ( ) 0 _ - + w W e E t T I o O { } [[ [] ][ ]] [m [M ]m ]M [( ]) [{ ]} | A f F ge gE gg G g0 g^ g$ g, g; gj gk gI h H j k l L ; ' z. z<CR> z- zz zt zb b B n N M , / ? <C-b> <C-d> <C-e> <C-f> <C-h> <C-i> <C-o> <C-t> <C-u> <C-y> - learn to use all of them
02:52  djerome: peth: yes, but what the build host has doesn't matter for cross-compiling.
02:53  dindinx: peth: thanks :)
02:53  djerome: peth: well, it matters differently...
02:54  peth: djerome: sorry, missed that. i have no idea what cross-compiling even is.
02:54  peth: just the configure output looked rather straight-forward in saying what it missed
02:56  djerome: yes, because i'm building for powerpc on x86. i don't know how to make it check for the correct ncurses.
02:58  nhak: dindinx: oh yeah, i mean i cannot move the cursor in insert mode ...
03:00  dindinx: nhak: yeah, insert mode is there to ... insert and nothing else. As a convinience, you can still move the cursor with the arrow keys from insert mode, but this isn't a good idea to use it. Leave insert mode as soon as you've finished inserting.
03:01  peth: djerome: it's rather old, but does this help you along? http://www.mail-archive.com/vim_dev@googlegroups.com/msg00887.html
03:02  djerome: peth: i tried that but the patch didn't completely work and i had other configure errors.
03:04  nhak: dindinx: ok, i must adapt to it :)
03:05  nhak: i still find emacs somehow better
03:05  peth: djerome: sorry, i have absolutely zero experience with this. maybe you'll have better luck on here later.

03:27  daniellopezific: when i use > to indent a selection, it unselects my selection, is there anyway to prevent this?
03:27  daniellopezific: i just want to be able to indent twice without re-selecting
03:31  fow: indent once and then use .
03:31  bairui: daniellopezific: also,   gv   reselects the last visual selection
03:32  daniellopezific: bairui, fow, thanks

04:42  rushfan: Does anyone here use foot pedals to activate the Esc and Control keys?
04:44  Chib: lolwat
04:44  spiiph: That sounds slower?
04:44  bairui: hehe... this is a recurring joke request. :)
04:45  rushfan: bairui: No I'm seriosu.
04:45  bairui: so am i
04:45  peth: i heard people do that but can't figure out why and how, considering how often i change my sitting position...
04:45  spiiph: I really think it would be slower.
04:45  spiiph: At least for me, who is completely without coordination between my hands and feet.

04:45  rushfan: eck. Sorry of rhte long link
04:45  rushfan: spiiph: Nah I think it'd save me from moving my hand from home row all th time
04:46  bairui: rushfan: I'm not denying that it can and has happened. I'm saying that it *is* a joke to do that.
04:46  rushfan: bairui: Oh I see. I don't think so :|
04:47  peth: caps-lock => esc and everything is beautiful
04:47  peth: maybe alt <=> ctrl too, so you can thumb ctrl
04:48  rushfan: peth: Well I got the caps-lock -> esc thing but the issue is ctrl
04:48  bairui: well, I am morbidly curious to learn how you go with this. I have always felt that it would be less... effective. Of course, if you're a pianist or pilot, it might actually be more natural for you. My feet are anywhere *but* the floor when I code, so it wouldn't work for me. :p
04:48  rushfan: I want ctrl to be there too
04:48  peth: rushfan: well, i do get that and i had good results with the alt/ctrl swapping
04:49  peth: but i understand you may be looking for something that goes further
04:49  rushfan: bairui: well I usually bounce my feet like bass drum pedals anyhow :|
04:49  rushfan: peth: If nothign else I'll get some funny looks in the research lab :D
04:49  bairui: grooving to the rhythm of vim :)
04:50  peth: heh, like we need yet another thing to make us stick out

04:50  rushfan: They all cry when they ahve to type at my workstation cause it isnt emacs

04:51  peth: success!
04:51  bairui: mine too... but that may have more to do with the coffee stains and pizza crusts. :p

08:21  rindolf: scp1: what's up?
08:21  scp1: rindolf, Applying some patches (yey) I got, you?
08:22  rindolf: scp1: woke up early.
08:22  rindolf: scp1: and got another contract.
08:22  rindolf: scp1: from someone I did some previous work for.
08:22  scp1: awesome! what kind of work?
08:22  rindolf: scp1: programming.
08:23  rindolf: scp1: Perl/Web.
08:23  scp1: rindolf, good for you. Are there lots of companies using Perl in Israel? It's really hard finding _anyone_ that hires Perl hackers here in sweden...
08:23  rindolf: scp1: well, the company is not in Israel.
08:24  scp1: Oh.
08:24  rindolf: scp1: they are an American company.

08:27  Chib: hmm, anyone know if there's a way to get vim to only wrap lines if your cursor is on them?
09:31  frogonwheels: Chib: interesting idea .. but no.
10:23  rindolf: Hi all.
10:42  bairui: Chib: hmm... you'd have to hook CursorMoved and measure line length, wrapping long ones manually with \n and repairing wrapped lines. Interesting idea... I might spend some time tomorrow morning looking into this - it's a great Deliberate Practise exercise. :)

11:02  al79: I am playing with vimscript and i have a very simple function in my .vim file defined like "function !s:Foo()" etc..
11:03  al79: I can source this vimscript just fine
11:03  al79: then i try to call the function using :call Foo()
11:03  al79: it saying unknown function
11:03  al79: any ideas?
11:03  rindolf: al79: does call s:Foo() work?
11:04  al79: rindolf: It says E81: Using <SID> not in a script context
11:04  Chib: computer crashed, did anyone respond to my question? (:
11:06  rindolf: Chib: I didn't see anything.
11:06  frogonwheels: al79: s: is script local.
11:07  frogonwheels: al79: so just lose the s:   and you should be good.
11:07  al79: Frogonwheels:oh great! thanks
12:26  kwijibo: arghh I restored a swap file i shouldn't have restored and lost  the last hour's work :(
12:27  peter_w: I don't see how that would work
12:30  kwijibo: not sure how it happened - I :e {other file} then :bw and then it asked if i wanted to recover a swap file
12:31  kwijibo: and i did, and I'd lost all my changes somehow
13:19  iaj: how can I find out why a !lint command is executed always I do :w on a html file?
13:20  mgedmin: iaj, look for autocommands with :au
13:23  iaj: should be bufwrite?
13:23  mgedmin: or maybe bufwritepost
13:24  mgedmin: if you do :verbose au, you'll see what script or plugin added that autocmd
13:25  babbio: Hi guys…I would like to ask you if there exist some plugin that allow to view the caller of a c function…so suppose I have a function test I would like to view every other functions which call the test function...
13:25  babbio: is this possible?
13:27  mgedmin: try cscope maybe

15:00  _rane: yeah
15:00  _rane: I have that "problem" as well
15:00  felixge_: is there something like ":wa" that will ignore unnamed buffers like this?
15:02  bosie: felixge_: haha
15:03  bosie: felixge_: i was having that problem too when i switched to vim
15:03  bosie: au FocusLost * silent! :wa
15:04  mgedmin: ooh, I'm gonna steal that au for my vimrc
15:04  felixge_: bosie: wow, thank you so much!
15:04  felixge_: bosie: exactly what I've been looking for :)
15:04  bosie: felixge_: yea, some check for names of buffers with custom functions, kinda seems unnecessary tbh
15:05  felixge_: bosie: just to make sure, this will still save all buffers it can? Or will hitting the "error" cause all next buffers to remain unsaved?
15:05  bosie: felixge_: it saves all buffers it can
15:05  felixge_: bosie: sweet
15:06  felixge_: bosie: I will add this here: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Auto_save_files_when_focus_is_lost

15:59  babbio: Guys I'm having problem loading colorscheme….I download molokai colorscheme but it doesn't work….could some body help me?
15:59  mgedmin: vimgor, CSApprox
15:59  vimgor: CSApprox is a plugin written by godlygeek to make GUI-only colorschemes Just Work in 88-/256-color terminals. It can be downloaded at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390
16:00  mgedmin: that's the usual problem and solution
16:00  mgedmin: followed by "help how can I enable 256-color support in gnome-terminal/$other_terminal_of_your_choice"
16:00  mgedmin: I don't know if vimgor has any triggers for that ...
16:02  babbio: I followed a guide to enable 256 colorscheme but after that If I load the color scheme the bash start blinking and never stop
16:02  mgedmin: what terminal do you use?
16:03  babbio: tryed linux bash shell and also mac osx terminal
16:04  mgedmin: bash is not a terminal
16:04  mgedmin: I don't use macos so can't help you with that
16:05  babbio: how can i see what terminal I'm on?
16:05  babbio: I connect remotely to my linux pc through ssh
16:07  mgedmin: the terminal you run ssh is the terminal that matters
16:07  mgedmin: and that would be the same mac os x terminal, wouldn't it?
16:08  mgedmin: there are people here who know a thing or two about macos, maybe wait until one of them wakes up
16:08  mgedmin: or google?
16:08  mgedmin: maybe iTerm supports 256-color modes where the builtin one doesn't?
16:08  mgedmin: I've no clue
16:10  babbio: ok so you are sayng that even if a connecto to a linux machine the color scheme is the colorscheme of iterm…ok I understand it
16:10  babbio: but do you think that with linux I could load molokai only setting color to 256 exporting TERM variable?
16:15  charas: <n00b question> Do I need to create .vimrc file just like I created .vim folder?
16:15  spiiph: charas, it's not created by itself, if that's what you mean. :)

16:16  charas: spiiph: Yeah this is exactly what I wanted to know. Thanks.

23:05  rindolf: rson: I know about snipMate.
