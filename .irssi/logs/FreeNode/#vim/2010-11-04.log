08:22  Axioplase_: qiyong: Install NerdCommenter
08:23 --- Channel #vim was synced in 82 seconds
08:23  Axioplase_: (basically, you'll then select your block visually, and call the comment function. Or do <motioncommand><commentfunction>, such as "gq,c" to comment a paragraph. (I don't remember wether ,c is the original command, or my own mapping though))
08:24  iaj: Axioplase_: its the original command
08:24  iaj: but is there a way to have those commenting actions repeated/
08:24  Axioplase_: You might need repeat.vim (?) by tpope
08:25  Axioplase_: Or use a macro. I think it really depends on the kind of repetition you want to do in each specific case.
08:28  qiyong: homekevin, I#<esc> doesn't work
08:28  qiyong: elik, ^^
08:30  elik: qiyong, hum?
08:32  elik: qiyong, can you be more descriptive? what did you try, how does it not work?
08:32  elik: and if you answer in 2hrs again, I'll be sleeping...
08:38  qiyong: elik, i use v or V to select a block, then I #
08:39  Raimondi: qiyong: Use  Ctrl-v
08:39  elik: qiyong, yeah, visual block is entered with ctrl-v
08:40  qiyong: Raimondi, works now, does the help v_b_I refer to ctrl-v?
08:41  qiyong: ok it's visual block, not visual
08:41  elik: qiyong, exactly
08:41  Raimondi: :)
08:41  dunz0r: How can I make a mapping that inputs some text, lets me input some text, and then when I leave insert mode inserts some more text?
08:42  dunz0r: I looks like this now: map <F5> :r !date<Return><Esc>$<Esc>a **<Esc>i
08:43  dunz0r: But I want it to do j^8i=<Esc> when I'm done inserting text in between the '*'
08:44  dunz0r: How can I best accomplish this?
08:45  DHulme: wouldn't it be easier to insert all the text at once and then just move the cursor to in between the **?
08:45  DHulme: and what are the first two <Esc> for?
08:51  dunz0r: I guess I could remove them really.
08:51  dunz0r: Just wanted to be sure :)
08:52  dunz0r: DHulme: You mean insert the needed text, then move up one line and move to **?
08:56  DHulme: yes
08:57  isaacs: hey, is it possible to map :Q to :q?  i read through :help map and couldn't seem to work out a way to do this
08:57  DHulme: isaacs: you need :command
08:57  isaacs: oic, wow, it actually changes it
08:57  isaacs: i thought i was typing it wrong
08:58  isaacs: nice.  that's probably been my most common typo
09:00  DHulme: an alternative would be to map ; to : and vice-versa
09:06  iaj: isaacs: or just learn how to touch type correctly;-) then left pinky would be used for (shift): and q :D
09:06  isaacs: iaj: i dunno who says that's actually correct.
09:07  isaacs: it's faster to use the right pinky for shift in :q
09:07  isaacs: iaj: it's not like we have to worry about jamming keys any more.
09:08  iaj: well, i was teached to use the other hand for pressing shift - the opposite of which the letter is.
09:08  isaacs: that's a bit saying you have to not split infinitives or that prepositions and conjunctions are things you can't end sentences with.
09:08  iaj: ;-) but yeah you may be right... even though I just tried - i can't : with my right hand only pretty well..
09:08  isaacs: iaj: most of the time, for most hands, that's correct.
09:08  iaj: isaacs: yeh.. :-)
09:09  isaacs: when my right pinky moves to shift, my right ringfinger is right over the ; key.  actually, i pretty much always hit ; with the right ring finger.
09:09  isaacs: 15 years of C-style languages, i'm not gonna retrain my hands where the ; is, ever.
09:12  iaj: isaacs: guess you're right.  however I'm forcing myself to do so - since I just learned on how to really touch type about 2 years ago
09:12  isaacs: wowzers, really?
09:12  isaacs: are you very young, or have you just been living without technology forever?
09:14  iaj: heh... not young.. 27 actually - but I used to be pretty fast on typing with even 5 fingers.. 
09:15  iaj: I just needed to get into real touch typing for vim I guess
09:22  dunz0r: Alot of people have been typing for alot longer than 10 years, and still don't know how to touch type.
09:23  dunz0r: And don't even use the correct finger setting.
09:23  dunz0r: The so called index-finger-dance is quite common.
09:32  the_isz: dunz0r: index-finger-dance sounds cool. i've often heard a german version (translated): eagle-search-system :)
09:34  Dynetrekk: where can I read about moving the cursor to a specific place after searching a word? my google-fu seems unable to supply me with an answer
09:39  iaj: index-finger-dance :))
09:43  Dynetrekk: iaj: funny
09:52  the_isz: Dynetrekk: do you mean relative to the search result?
09:52  Dynetrekk: the_isz: exactly. I know the end of the word: /phrase/e but I would like to learn more
09:52  Dynetrekk: the_isz: I sometimes need to change a lot of occurrences in big latex documents
09:53  the_isz: Dynetrekk: ok, i was just seeing if i got you correctly.
09:53  Dynetrekk: the_isz: sure
09:54  the_isz: Dynetrekk: how about  :he {offset}  ?
09:54  Dynetrekk: the_isz: looks exactly right. thanks a bunch!
09:55  the_isz: Dynetrekk: yay, i was helpful :)
09:55  Dynetrekk: I'd say so
09:55  Dynetrekk: +1 dynetrekk likes this, etc
10:29  heeen: why does vim jump to line 23 instead of 123 if you do 123G
10:29  heeen: *sometimes
10:30  Raimondi: Are you sure that you type the 1 *everytime?
10:30  muffinmad: heeen: press 1 harder :)
10:36  cxreg: are you sure 1 is a number in your locale? :)
10:38  heeen: it happens often enough
10:46  Raimondi: heeen: Next time it happens, see what did you typed with  :echo v:prevcount
10:49  iaj: where is the indenting of a filetype defined?
10:50  Raimondi: indent/(filetype).vim
10:50  Raimondi: Prepend $VIMRUNTIME
10:51  iaj: thanks Raimondi 
10:51  Raimondi: Or somewhere in your &rtp
10:51  Raimondi: np
10:52  iaj: Raimondi: no indent folder here in my .vim - so I guess it's somewhere on my osx harddisc - &rtp as you already mentioned
10:52  Raimondi: Inside MacVim, iirc  /Applications/MacVim/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/etc
10:56  iaj: thanks Raimondi theres no way once I wrote a file, and closed it to use earlier to get it back to a previous state, correct?
10:56  Raimondi: If you have presistent undo enabled, the answer could be yes
10:56  Raimondi: persistent*
10:57  iaj: do you recommen to have that enabled?
10:57  Raimondi: I compiled MacVim myself only for that feature :)
10:58  iaj: oh and btw, how could I delete the current file?
10:58  iaj: heh.. so I guess the answer is yes :D
10:58  Raimondi: :!rm %
10:58  iaj: Raimondi: the setting for that persistent undo - what's it called again?
10:59  Raimondi: :h 'undofile'
11:00  iaj: thanks :) do you have a separate undodir set?
11:00  Raimondi: No
11:01  iaj: so theres a undofile in each directory you'r editing files in?
11:01  Raimondi: Yes
11:01  iaj: mhhhhh okay :-)
11:01  Raimondi: Well, a undofile for each file
11:02  Raimondi: But undodir is for those who doesn't like to have that many files everywhere :)
11:03  iaj: that can be pretty confusing I guess
11:04  Raimondi: Not usually, they are dot files so usually don't interfere and gitignore keeps them away from my repos.
11:05  iaj: well if you got a large .java project with lots of files - it could be confusing i guess.
11:05  iaj: set my undodir to .vim/undo
11:05  henk: hi, i have a file with a layout like "name[[space]]type[[space]]value" (dns zonefile). is there a way to make the type line up cleanly in all lines no matter how long 'name' is?
11:05  Raimondi: I guess.
11:06  Raimondi: vimgor: tabular
11:06  vimgor: Tabular is godlygeek's plugin to align text in vim, http://github.com/godlygeek/tabular
11:06  Raimondi: henk: ^
11:06  henk: Raimondi: thanks, will have a look.
11:07  Raimondi: iaj: Feel free to use undodir, I don't need it, but it's there to be used ;)
11:07  iaj: Raimondi: yeah.. heh :-)
11:07  iaj: the only confusing thing is now when I edit files and want to go back to the state when I first opened the file
11:07  Raimondi: Good night!
11:07  iaj: I can't just hit u several times
11:08  iaj: but use :e :}
11:08  iaj: good night felal
11:08  iaj: fella* even.
11:11  rweng: iaj: :e is to edit a file, isnt it? I want to delete the current buffer/file
11:13  ouah: hi
11:13  ouah: in vertical split, how I can switch in the sense left become right and right become left
11:15  iaj: rweng: :e will reload the file...
11:15  iaj: :bd would remove the buffer from the bufferlist ,  :!rm %  would remove the file
11:15  iaj: ^rweng
11:16  rweng: iaj: ok, but I want to delete it
11:18  iaj: rweng: see my second statement:)
11:21  the_isz: ouah:  :he window-moving
11:22  ouah: the_isz: thanks!
11:23  rweng: iaj: ^rweng?
11:23  the_isz: ouah: you're welcome
11:24  iaj: rweng: did you try :!rm %  ? 
11:29  ouah: &part
11:55  Quintin: hi, I'm really frustrated with vim
11:55  Quintin: can I not have mouse support in vim, AND have X auto copy of what I hilite?  Is this not possible?
11:56  jink: You can shift-drag to get X to copy it.  If you just drag, it'll be a visual block, and you could yank it.
11:57  Quintin: What I need is it to go on X buffer to paste into email
11:57  Quintin: what I am doing is copying my homework answers to email to instructor.  let me try the shift thing..
11:57  jink: So, select it, then "+y it.
11:58  Quintin: +y?
11:58  Quintin: that doesn't let me paste it into web browser
11:58  jink: "+y  yank to + register
11:59  Quintin: don't know what this + register business is all about, but shift clickdrag did it, thnx, don't have to shoot laptop full of holes now
11:59  jink: :)
12:00  jink: :help quoteplus
12:00  Quintin: maybe after my million homeworks are done
12:15 --- daniel_ is now known as daniel
12:20  iaj: if you guys want to copy a whole document to clipboard - do you usually gg"*yG ?
12:20  iaj: or use any binding?
12:21  iaj: i had yad bound to :%y *   but I can't "ayad or somehting - that's what I'm trying to achieve.. heh
12:22  jink: ggVG"+y 's what I use, I guess.
12:25  the_isz: iaj: hmm... can't image when i would want to do that. in what situations do you copy a whole file into the clipboard?
12:28  saimon_: hi..how do I properly escape {{link}} to search/replace in buffer?
12:28  iaj: the_isz: dunno, but I find myself doing it a lot... eg. for appending it to a different file
12:28  saimon_: I've tried \{\{\w+}} but it doesn't work
12:29  the_isz: iaj: i'd do  :w >> other_file  for that
12:30  saimon_: in fact I get =>  \{ follows nothing for that search
12:30  the_isz: saimon_: yeah, you must not escape the { if they're literals
12:30  saimon_: the_isz: ah...duh..thanks
12:30  the_isz: saimon_: np^^
12:30  iaj: the_isz: would I be able to do :w >> <open buffer> ?
12:31  saimon_: the_isz: I type /{{\w+}} => Pattern not found {{\w+}}
12:31  the_isz: iaj: that'd by at least tricky i guess...
12:31  the_isz: saimon_: the + needs to be escaped though ;)
12:31  the_isz: saimon_: see  :he pattern.txt
12:32  saimon_: the_isz: thx I need to read that
12:32  iaj: another question.. when I got a line pointing to a file - is there some way to extract that file and replace the line?
12:33  iaj: eg. get that file to the position where the line was?
12:34  the_isz: iaj: you mean you have a file name in a file and want to replace the name with the contents of that file?
12:34  iaj: the_isz: yeah.
12:36  the_isz: iaj: i'd probably use :r, but there are niftier ways for sure
12:41  the_isz: iaj: found a cooler solution: mark a range of filenames you want replaced by their file's contents and go with:  :!xargs cat
12:42 * the_isz loves shell magic.
12:42  iaj: wow.. thanks
12:42  iaj: never  heard of the xargs command :\
12:43  PelleTut: If I want to add something, for instance % in front of say 20 lines, how would I do that?
12:44  the_isz: PelleTut:  <c-v>20jI%<cr>
12:45  the_isz: PelleTut: or  :,+200i%<cr>
12:45  the_isz: PelleTut:   :,+20normal 0i%<cr>  even
12:45  estragib: the_isz: you mean <esc>?
12:46  the_isz: estragib: no, otherwise i'd written <esc> ;)
12:46  estragib: ok, maybe i misunderstood what PelleTut wants :)
12:47  the_isz: estragib: let's wait for him to answer, maybe you're right and i'm wrong
12:47  iaj: :,20s/^/%/  id use that one. =)  so many possibilites
12:48  the_isz: iaj: yeah, that one's nice, too
12:49  PelleTut: uhmm, what does <cr> mean?
12:49  the_isz: estragib: oh, and you meant with my first suggestion, right? there must be an <esc> at the end, not a <cr>
12:49  estragib: i did :)
12:49  the_isz: PelleTut: carriage return = enter, but i was wrong
12:49  the_isz: PelleTut: must be <esc>, like estragib suggested
12:49  the_isz: PelleTut: for the first option, that is
12:49  the_isz: PelleTut: it should be right in the others
12:53  PelleTut: does <c-v> mean ctrl + v?
12:55  PelleTut: guess so :)
13:01 --- silex is now known as Silex
13:25  dfrank: hello all. I probably found a bug in Windows version of Vim 7.3: "cw" in normal mode works like "ce". At that, "dw" and "vw", and just "w" works properly. Please, check it at your machines.
13:27  spiiph: It's not a bug.
13:27  spiiph: And it has always worked like that.
13:27  dfrank: spiiph: hm. well. what's the point of this behavior?
13:28  dfrank: spiiph: imho this is illogical.
13:28  spiiph: Probably that cw does what you expect, rather than what would be logical considering other commands.
13:28  spiiph: :h cw
13:31  dfrank: spiiph: thanks. i got it, but anyway i don't think this is really good idea)
13:34  spiiph: Why? I often just want to change the word, and not the spacing, when using cw
13:34  spiiph: And I can easily use caw, if I want something else
14:11  tdn: When having multiple files open in Vim windows, how do I make the windows sizes equal?
14:12  spiiph: <C-w>=
14:12  spiiph: And that would be you having multiple windows open, or split windows. You can have multiple files open without having split windows.
14:18  sledges: hello
14:18  sledges: how to find lines with current date?
14:19  spiiph: Depends on your date format
14:20  spiiph: /2010-11-04 ought to do it, if you use a good format.
14:22  sledges: but i do not want to input current date, that's the trick
14:22  spiiph: Ah
14:23  spiiph: /<C-r>=strftime("%Y-%M-%d") perhaps
14:23  spiiph: :h strftime( and :h c_CTRL-R
14:23  sledges: \/\=strftime("%m/%d/%y") just doesn't seem to cut it..
14:23  sledges: s/\\//
14:23  _rane: /\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
14:23  _rane: oh wait
14:23  spiiph: _rane, that won't help.
14:23  _rane: realized...
14:23  sledges: :)
14:24  sledges: right... still no one-keystroke solution, spiiph ..
14:25  spiiph: Just map it
14:25  sledges: ?
14:25  spiiph: :h :map
14:26  sledges: but
14:26  sledges: i will still have to be pressing Ctrl+R (imo Ctrl+R cannot be scripted/simulated)
14:26  spiiph: Sure it can
14:27  sledges: ok
14:29  spiiph: :map <F3> /<C-r>=strftime("%Y-%M-%d")<CR><CR>
14:29  sledges: brilliant
14:30  sledges: i was defiant, because typing /<C-r>=strftime("%Y-%M-%d") would not do the trick ;) (patternt not found  <C-r>=strftime("%Y-%M-%d"))
14:30  sledges: but mapping - does :D
14:30  sledges: thanks heaps spiiph !
14:30  spiiph: np
14:31  sledges: this case was slightly counterintuitive, but at the same time -- logical :D
14:36  Silex: damnit, <C-r> is awesome
14:43  sledges: spiiph: let's go further: :map <F3> %s/<C-r>=strftime("%Y-%M-%d")//<CR><CR> -- trailing character. how could i escape the resulting %s/2010/11/04//g ?
14:44  sqz: Silex: you mean redo?
14:45  spiiph: sledges, :h escape(
14:45  sledges: thanks!
14:45  sledges: (tried strstr and replace :D)
14:45  spiiph: sledges, note also that there are functions to do search and substitution: :h search(, :h substitute(
14:46  spiiph: If you want a more code-like approach
14:46  sledges: ok, will do know
14:46  sledges: i love vim :D
14:48  DestinyAwaits: spiiph : Hello, Sir :-)
14:55  spiiph: hi
14:56 --- scottschulthess_ is now known as scottschulthess
14:56  Silex: sqz: no, when in insert mode or ex mode
14:56  Silex: it can just do about anything
15:00  dfrank: spiiph: Why? Because of if you want to change word, you can use "ce", and all will be ok. Well, on the same logic, "dw" sounds like "delete word", but "dw" deletes word and spacing after it.
15:02  spiiph: Well, they do what you want. If you want to delete a word, you usually want to delete the spacing after it as well.
15:03  dfrank: spiiph: ok, i'm rubber, you're glue. :)
15:03  catsup: they don't do what you want
15:03  catsup: if they did, cw would not delete the space
15:03  Silex: what <C-?> was it to be able to type a normal mode thing when in insert mode?
15:04  catsup: instead of guessing what you want based on the command that follows, you specify whether you want to select the space or not
15:04  Silex: e.g if you want to jump a word while in insert mode
15:04  ponty: hi. what is the best file-browser plugin for vim?
15:04  iaj: Silex: <C-o>
15:04  Silex: iaj: thanks
15:05  dfrank: catsup: cw don't delete the space.
15:05  catsup: what
15:05  catsup: oh shit you're right
15:05  catsup: that's stupid >:|
15:06  catsup: who's responsible for that
15:06  catsup: i want his head
15:06  dfrank: catsup: ok, there IS some logic in this behavior, but anyway i'm sure the editor should do the same for "w", "W", "e", "E", etc, indepentently of action.
15:07  pvullo: Hello. Is there a way to use the ctags with javascripts source file ? I can have the symbol list, but Ctrl + ] doesn't work.      It's because my function are declared like that : function Myclass.myfunction() , and I call them with m.myfunction()   .  What can I do to force ctags to reconize just the myfunction(), not what is before ?
15:07  catsup: dfrank: i agree with you completely that this inconsistency is a misfeature
15:07  pvullo: I use taglist.
15:08  dfrank: catsup: maybe there's way to make some hack remapping for that )
15:08  dfrank: catsup: i will think about it
15:08  catsup: it shouldn't be a hack
15:08  catsup: it should be an option
15:09  catsup: to disable all such 'DWIM' features
15:09  catsup: like, set nodwim
15:09  dfrank: but it is not. then, the only way to do this is hack.
15:09  catsup: you could edit the vim core
15:09  catsup: of course you probably do not want to
15:09  pvullo: Where can i find help with ctags and javascript ?
15:12  mgedmin: pvullo, I think exuberant ctags has a mailing list, I'm not really sure
15:12  mgedmin: I remember several years ago the author asked for help maintaining the various languages
15:12  dfrank: pvullo: ctags --list-kinds  will return you all options for all languages. See what is about javasript. Maybe turning off classes will help, i dunno.
15:13  pvullo: That's interesting, thanks ; I'll have a look.
15:13  dfrank: and pastebin your code.
15:15  heeen: would it be possible to write a syntax plugin that uses an external parser
15:15  dfrank: catsup: huh, see :h cw . There's suggested mapping to avoid this stupid behavior.
15:15 --- vim is now known as Guest55299
15:16  mgedmin: heeen, I don't think so
15:16  heeen: vim wants to update syntax -> invoke external parser emitting source with syntax tags -> color according to tags
15:16  mgedmin: you're talking about vim's syntax plugins, right?
15:16  heeen: so you could use clang as parser
15:16  heeen: like xcode seems to do
15:16  mgedmin: vim matches syntax during drawing; it doesn't store information about position/color, unlike, say, emacs
15:16  catsup: dfrank: oh cool
15:16  catsup: dfrank: but is this the only instance of such stupidity?
15:16  Guest55299: I know its not directly related to vim, but does anyone know why vim doesnt work on a remote solaris server?  When i type vim, it just hangs there doing nothing.  I think its something to do with a display or something...
15:17  heeen: Guest55299: wrong TERM maybe?
15:17  dfrank: catsup: i think yes. From help: "Special case"
15:17  heeen: mgedmin: can you -vv
15:17  Guest55299: heeen: Im no unix expert so I don't know what you mean.  How can i check this?
15:18  catsup: i see, they copied it from the original vi
15:18  heeen: try: TERM=xterm vim
15:18  catsup: so bill joy is to blame
15:18  catsup: but it's so hard to stay mad at bill joy
15:18  catsup: :)
15:18  heeen: mgedmin: maybe you could hack it through ftype stuff
15:18  Guest55299: heeen: tried that, but its not doing anything or returning me to the prompt
15:19  heeen: *shrug*
15:19  mgedmin: Guest55299, then try DISPLAY= vim
15:19  pvullo: dfrank, http://pastebin.com/KijstJVH
15:19  mgedmin: if that helps, then yes, it's something to do with X
15:19  Guest55299: heeen: and I can't ctrl-c out of it,  that is exactly what happens when i try to run vim
15:20  Guest55299: mgedmin: yeah that's worked, it put me straight into vim
15:20  deryni: vim shouldn't hang forever trying to talk to X, it should only be a few seconds, no?
15:20  catsup: hit ctrl-c
15:20  catsup: to stop the hang
15:20  Guest55299: ctrl-c doesnt do anything
15:20  deryni: I mean I guess it could get stuck actually trying to talk to it as opposed to failing to talk to it.
15:20  catsup: really
15:20  catsup: hm
15:21  dfrank: catsup: crap, mapping is bad idea. Because of if i'd like to repeat my last action, then only insert will be repeated, not the "dwi".
15:21  catsup: oh yeah maybe deryni is right
15:21  catsup: dfrank: indeed
15:21  Guest55299: catsup: the only way i can exit is to close the terminal and log back in
15:21  catsup: dfrank: it's a dirty hack
15:21  catsup: Guest55299: or log in twice and kill
15:21  mgedmin: or try ctrl-\ to send SIGQUIT
15:22  Guest55299: mgedmin: ctrl-\ sends me directly into vim, cool..
15:22  mgedmin: wha? I didn't expect that
15:23  Guest55299: mgedmin: ill just do that in future...
15:23  deryni: Can you log in twice and use strace to see where vim is "hanging" when it is stuck?
15:23  deryni: Because now I'm curious.
15:24  Guest55299: deryni: ok, im logged in twice, just want me to type strace?
15:24  mgedmin: how are you connecting to that remote server?  ssh?
15:24  mgedmin: is ssh X forwarding enabled?
15:24  Guest55299: mgedmin: ssh
15:25  Guest55299: i get in with ssh just fine.  I dont know if ssh X forwarding is enabled, im sure it will be the default
15:25  Guest55299: deryni: how do i use strace?
15:26  dfrank: pvullo: i can't detect any wrong behavior. tell me, what should i do to see that Ctrl+] not working?
15:27  deryni: Guest55299: Run vim, when it hangs run ps in the other terminal to get the pid then run strace -p <pid> and pastebin what strace says (it should print a couple of lines and then hang).
15:28  mgedmin: alternatively, strace -o logfile vim
15:28  mgedmin: then in the other terminal tail -f logfile
15:29  Guest55299: deryni: I just get : "ERROR: tracer already exists" when i type "strace  -p 19514"
15:29  mgedmin: wait, this is solaris
15:29  mgedmin: it has something called truss that's the equivalent of strace
15:29  mgedmin: I've no idea how to use it
15:29  mgedmin: Guest55299, echo $DISPLAY
15:29  mgedmin: on the remote server
15:29  Guest55299: mgedmin: rocket:0.0
15:29  mgedmin: if ssh X forwarding is used, it'll be something like localhost:10.0
15:30  mgedmin: so, your .profile or something sets $DISPLAY
15:30  mgedmin: nasty
15:30  deryni: Right, truss.
15:30  mgedmin: is rocket the hostname of the solaris server?
15:30  mgedmin: or is that a third machine?
15:30  Guest55299: mgedmin: hostname of server
15:31  Guest55299: Truss gives me "pollsys(0x080473C0, 1, 0x00000000, 0x00000000) (sleeping...)"
15:31  Guest55299: and thats all
15:31  pvullo: dfrank, arrrr that's working now, I don't know why :(
15:31  Guest55299: truss -p 19514
15:31  mgedmin: I'm guessing that means it's waiting for a socket, and no response is forthcoming
15:31  dfrank: pvullo: haha
15:32  dfrank: pvullo: so, this is ":)", not ":("
15:38  pattern: every time i open a given file, vim puts the cursor on the first line of the file, regardless of where the cursor was when i last closed the file
15:38  deryni: Guest55299: Try the 'truss -o logfile vim' method? It might tell us a bit more about what vim is trying to do when it gets stuck. But yeah, I think finding whatever is setting DISPLAY and fixing it to not do that is likely the right answer
15:38  mgedmin: pattern, there's a nifty autocmd to fix that
15:38  deryni: pattern: :help last-position-jump
15:38  pattern: how can i have vim automatically, when the file is opened, put the cursor back to where it was when the file was last closed?
15:39  mgedmin: deryni found it first
15:41  pattern: thanks, that worked
15:48  iaj: which sw setting do you guys use ? :)
16:03  Silex: anyone uses netrw on windows? the classic example 	let g:netrw_scp_cmd = '"c:\Program Files\PuTTY\pscp.exe" -q -batch'
16:03  Silex:  doens't work
16:03  Silex: basically, it doens't escape the cmd /c call correctly
16:03  Silex: when I do something like :e scp://foo/bar
16:04  Silex: generally speaking, I think how :! stuffs are escaped is somewhat wrong
16:04  spiiph: Try using forward slashes in the path.
16:08  Silex: same
16:09  Silex: ah, apparently there's a fix at http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_PuTTY_pscp_with_Vim
16:09  Silex: which involves editing the netrw plugin
16:13  Silex: yeah, vim has teh quoting wrong by default... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/355988/how-do-i-deal-with-quote-characters-when-using-cmd-exe
16:18  Guest55299: Is there somewhere public i can put my large logfile?
16:18  Silex: ideone.com?
16:18  Silex: codepad.org?
16:23  Guest55299: deryni: here's the truss logfile, i cant see anything obvious, maybe you can? http://codepad.org/0ZXsvMbC
16:25  deryni: Guest55299: What happens if you run something like xlsclients from the ssh session?
16:26  Guest55299: deryni: nothing happens
16:26  darkredandyellow: c&p problem: I select something in visual mode and copy it with 'y'.
16:26  darkredandyellow: Now I want to insert that at the end of some arbitrary line. Unfortunately 'p' inserts _before_ the last char, which leads to doing 'i' -> 'space' -> 'escape' -> 'p'
16:26  darkredandyellow: how can I do this more efficient?
16:27  deryni: Guest55299: No hang? No error? No output?
16:28  Guest55299: deryni: no error, no output, just does nothing, doesnt return to command line, pressing enter just creates new lines, Ctrl-c quits.
16:28  deryni: So it hangs like vim does. Ok.
16:29  Guest55299: deryni: yeah, apart from I can't ctrl-c vim
16:29  r00k: somehow, i'm doing something to my terminal or vim session that makes the <CR>'s in my bound commands not work. they just show up as ^M's. any ideas what could be causing this?
16:29  deryni: ctrl-c with vim hanging does nothing at all?
16:30  Guest55299: deryni: correct
16:30  deryni: r00k: Example?
16:30  Guest55299: deryni: pressing ctrl-\  opens vim
16:31  r00k: deryni: i've got this line in my vimrc: map <Leader>t :!ruby -I"test" -I"spec" %<CR>   sometimes, i'll hit leader t, and i'll see that whole line, with an ^M appended where the <CR> would be; and rather than running the command, it just stays there on vim's command line
16:31  r00k: if i quit vim and come back, the behavior goes away
16:31  r00k: however, if i do a mksession and restore it, the behavior is still there
16:31  r00k: so it seems i'm setting sometihng in vim, somehow, that's causing this
16:32  the_isz: darkredandyellow: i think the 'i' in your example is wrong, but that's not the point i suppose. if you have that situation often you could map  A <esc>p  to a key, but i don't have a better idea :(
16:33  darkredandyellow: the_isz, I see. thanks anyways....
16:33  deryni: r00k: When the mapping is broken what does ':map <Leader>t' say?
16:33  the_isz: darkredandyellow: <Leader>p  would be a logical choice for a mapping, maybe you should give that a whirl.
16:34  r00k: deryni:    ,t            :!ruby -I"test" -I"spec" %<CR>
16:35  cirwin: If I open a new file, and then do r!<command>, the first line is a blank line — can I avoid that?
16:35  darkredandyellow: the_isz, alright, I'll give it a shot, thanks...:-)
16:35  graywh: cirwin, no, you have to delete it yourself
16:35  cirwin: ah well
16:35  deryni: r00k: Is it paste mode maybe?
16:36 * cirwin writes some aliases
16:36  r00k: deryni: i thought the same, but doing ':set nopaste' doesn't fix it
16:38  the_isz: darkredandyellow: you're welcome.
16:43  deryni: r00k: I'm assuming you don't know what action(s) on your part trigger the problem?
16:52  iaj: can I somehow have keyword completion on the commandline (from a word from the buffer)..?
16:58  mgedmin: iaj, if you use the cmdline window, then yes
17:00  mgedmin: hm
17:00 --- altamic_ is now known as altamic
17:00  mgedmin: so, folding
17:01  mgedmin: I like to start editing with all my folds open
17:01  mgedmin: that's why I set foldlevelstart=9999
17:01  the_isz: iaj: you can define a completion for self-defined functions, but i doubt that's what you're looking for
17:01  mgedmin: but then I'd like to close the deepest level of folds
17:01  mgedmin: and there's no way to do that :/
17:01  graywh: mgedmin, annoying, right?
17:01  mgedmin: I have to zM to close all of them, and then zr zr zr a few times
17:02  mgedmin: is there a way to find out the maximum fold level in a file?
17:02  graywh: does zM zR zm work?
17:02  mgedmin: augh, what's the key to resync folds?
17:02  mgedmin: I accidentally edited something
17:03  mgedmin: zx
17:03  mgedmin: graywh, have cookie, zM zR zm does exactly what I want
17:04  graywh: i guess you could :norm zMzR on bufread
17:04  graywh: or something
17:06 * mgedmin will start with :map ,zm zMzRzm
17:06  mgedmin: ,zmzmzm has a certain rhythm to it
17:11  mgedmin: looks like LustyExplorer can't help me find files when I remember just a fragment of the filename but not the subdirectory
17:12  mgedmin: time to try out FuzzyFinder?
17:12  mgedmin: or maybe CommandT?
17:12  iaj: mgedmin:  I'd try CommandT... or when on mac.. peepopen ;)
17:13  mgedmin: ugh, vimballs ...
17:13  iaj: im using commandT for new (not recently opened files) - and fuzzy MRU for last edited files
17:13  Raimondi: What's wrong with vimballs?
17:16  mgedmin: oh, bloody vim-debug maps <Leader>t
17:17  MTecknology: So.. I was curious and tried vim -y ... how the heck do I get out of it?
17:18  MTecknology: I try Esc :q! - but I end up typing that instead
17:18  Raimondi: MTecknology: HAve you tried <C-O>:q!<CR>
17:19  mgedmin: ha ha, "easy"
17:19  mgedmin: so, command-t first impression: awesome, that's exactly what I want
17:19  MTecknology: Raimondi: thanks :)
17:19  Raimondi: np :)
17:19  mgedmin: second impression: what's this about errors after pressing enter, and the non-disappearing GoToFile window?
17:19  mgedmin: "Zero count: silent b 0", whazzatmean?
17:21  Raimondi: I saw a commit to fix that today in github
17:21  r00k: deryni: yeah, no idea. i'm a bit stumped.
17:21  bob_f: Hi. For some reason selecting text in visual mode in vim no longer sets the X selection to the selected text. Does anybody know what I can do to make this work again ? Thanks.
17:22  mgedmin: http://pastie.org/1272522 <- command-t fail
17:22  Raimondi: https://wincent.com/issues/1617
17:22 * mgedmin tries git HEAD
17:23  xybre: Ooo yeah, something been bugging me. Can I make Vim let me do visual select in insert mode using shift+movement keys?
17:23  bob_f: Heh heh heh.
17:24  LeoNerd: Sure.. :imap it
17:28  mgedmin: git head gives me same error, weird
17:28  mgedmin: I even restarted vim
17:29  mgedmin: correction: earlier I used to get two errors -- on :bwipeout and on :b
17:29  mgedmin: now it's just the :b
17:31  xybre: Hmm, it'd have to just be the arrow keys. I know I can select in insert mode using the mouse without a problem.
17:45 * mgedmin finds a workaround, posts it to https://wincent.com/issues/1617 and finds that the author found the place that needs fixing 10 minutes ago
17:45  mgedmin: and my comment is moderated because I cannot verify my email because my mail server does greylisting
17:47  mgedmin: can I tell command-t to ignore certain file suffixes?
17:47  mgedmin: things like .so and .pyc
17:48  mgedmin: 'wildignore', ok
17:49  mgedmin: hey, I have *.pyc in my wildignore
17:49  mgedmin: no, it's set by the python ftplugin
17:50  mgedmin: what's the difference between 'wildignore' and 'suffixes' anyway?
17:51 --- altamic_ is now known as altamic
17:52  mgedmin: command-t is awesome
17:52  lericson: How do I delete three lines in a command? like :d but three lines.
17:52  creidiki: 3dd
17:52  lericson: Oh. :d3
17:53  mgedmin: g:CommandTCursorEndMap and g:CommandTCursorStartMap should map <End> and <Home>, not just <C-e> and <C-a> by default
17:53  mgedmin: oh, that's right, mac users don't have home/end keys on their keyboards
