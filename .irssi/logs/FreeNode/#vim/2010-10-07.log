09:32  Tasser: how to insert a newline to :s?
09:32  Raimondi: Tasser: Match with \n and replace with \r
09:33  Tasser: thanks
09:33  Raimondi: np
09:42  frogonwheels: oh crap - how annoying - If  ii lose my connection I have to leave #vim in order to register and then join again :(
09:43  iaj: Why is it btw - that one has to replace \n with \r ?
09:44  frogonwheels: iaj: you mean why do you match with \n and replace with \r ?
09:45  frogonwheels: hysterical reasons mostly -
09:46  frogonwheels: I think: \r matches a CR ie ctrl-M  .. and \n in a replace, inserts a Nul  - so they're taken.
09:47  iaj: frogonwheels: ohhh that's why.. hmm thanks - I was just wondering
09:58  SpiceMan: is there a :tabwhatever *  that behaves like vim -p *
10:00  Raimondi: SpiceMan: I think  :tab ball  will do that, not sure though.
10:02  SpiceMan: err :tab ball opens a tab for "ball"
10:04  SpiceMan: uhm, it that when :he was open oO
10:04  SpiceMan: *did that
10:23  SpiceMan: evil:   :argd *  :arga *txt  :argdo tabe
10:23  iDesperadO: hello there...I have this config in my .vimrc:
10:23  iDesperadO: python << EOF
10:23  iDesperadO: import os
10:23  iDesperadO: import sys
10:23  iDesperadO: import vim
10:23  iDesperadO: for p in sys.path:
10:23  iDesperadO:      if os.path.isdir(p):
10:23  iDesperadO:           vim.command(r"set path+=.,%s" % (p.replace(" ", r"\ ")))
10:23  iDesperadO: EOF but I can't gf to some imports from my python files...and when I add ".py" to the imports...it can...how's that?? I don't want to add ".py" to gf to it...
10:23  Raimondi: Stop that
10:24  iDesperadO: Raimondi: how could I gf to some source files?
10:24  Raimondi: iDesperadO: Use this:  http://vim.pastey.net
10:24  Raimondi: To paste more than one line of text into the room
10:25  iDesperadO: Raimondi: well..help me first OK?
10:25  Raimondi: Mmm... a bit demanding, I'll take it the good way ;)
10:25 --- silex is now known as Silex
10:25  strull: iDesperadO: noone here gets paid for helping
10:25  Raimondi: I don't work with Python, but you could see into normal gf
10:26  iDesperadO: strull: I know it....so all gets my appreciation...
10:26  iDesperadO: strull: I just want to say that this piece of code isn't that long that needs to be pased in  pastey.net
10:27  Raimondi: iDesperadO: It was.
10:27  iDesperadO: Raimondi: OK..fine...
10:27  Raimondi: iDesperadO: Read  :h :normal  for how to use gf
10:27  iDesperadO: maybe I'm just in a curry
10:27  iDesperadO: hurry
10:27  LanEast: iDesperadO: try :help 'sua' ?
10:28  Raimondi: Don't worry, I've done it myself ;)
10:29  iDesperadO: LanEast:  thank you...
10:29  LanEast: iDesperadO: :)
10:29  iDesperadO: the wierd thing is that...I have the same config in my home...and it works
10:30  iDesperadO: now in the office...it won't
10:30  Raimondi: You can see where the option was changed with  :verbose set option?
10:32  iDesperadO: ?
10:32  iDesperadO: which item you want to see?
10:33  Silex: how do I manipulate the output of a : command? e.g my goal is to do smth like :version | grep foo
10:33  Raimondi: YOu can use that for the option that is differente between home and work.
10:33  Silex: but already copying the output in a yank would be nice
10:33  Raimondi: Silex: :h :redir
10:33  iDesperadO: I didn't change anything...
10:33  Silex: Raimondi: thanks
10:34  Raimondi: iDesperadO: Did 'sua' fix the problem? maybe its value is different between both places.
10:34  iDesperadO: sua fixes
10:35  iDesperadO: I just add au Filetype python set sua=.py
10:35  iDesperadO: and it works
10:35  iDesperadO: but this won't work when the imports like "from * import *,*,*"
10:44  JasonWoof: where's the bugtracker?
10:45  JasonWoof: also, http://vim.org/ doesn't work for me
10:45  JasonWoof: instant: "Error 105 (net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED): The server could not be found."
10:46  Raimondi: YOu can post to the vim_dev list: http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev
10:46  JasonWoof: there's no bug tracker?
10:50  Raimondi: Nope
10:50  trijntje: Hi all, is there a way to automatically unfold if you go to a certain line number with :10, When line 10 is in a closed fold
10:57  JasonWoof: weird!
10:57  JasonWoof: ok, well if anybody's interested, and/or could help get it merged, I made a patch fix php syntax coloring to hilight some rather common escape sequences: http://jasonwoof.com/downloads/hilight-rest-of-escaped-chars.patch
10:58  JasonWoof: these for single quoted strings: \\  \'   and this one for double quoted strings:  \"
10:58  JasonWoof: and I just posted it to vim_dev
10:59  Raimondi: JasonWoof: YOu might want to email that to the maintainer, hi info is at the top of $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/php.vim
11:00  JasonWoof: Raimondi: ahh, thanks. I'll do that
11:00  Raimondi: Just in case he's still working on it.
11:26  dwarder: i'm always forgeting how to open current slice in tab
11:26  dwarder: anyone knows?
11:27  dwarder: this time i'll write it down
11:36  achromic: is there a way to sort a list of indented text objects? basically i want to sort yaml or outlines by the "header" lines and all the indented lines below the header lines would be moved with header lines wherever the sort places them
11:42  mgedmin: hm
11:42  mgedmin: join the lines with some unlikely separator, sort, then split
11:43  achromic: interesting
11:44  achromic: no wait, i want to sort only on the header lines, but if the header line is joined with the rest of it's indented lines they will also influence the sort, making it an "unstable" sort
11:45  Dark_MX: hi all guru
11:46  Dark_MX: I try create tab wrapper. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/272131/ :(
11:47  marlun: Does Command-T and simular plugins use normal buffers to show the list of files?
11:47  Dark_MX: Realy need check zencoding => snipmate => or return <C-p>
11:52  mgedmin: achromic, so put a line number at the end of the header line, to enforce stability
11:53  achromic: mgedmin: thanks. gonna mull this over
11:55  dwarder: how do i open slice in new tab
12:21 --- Axioplase is now known as Axioplase_
12:27  dwarder: how do i open current slice in new tab
12:29  mgedmin: what's a slice?
12:29  daniel: :tabnew %
12:29  daniel: mgedmin: i guess he means a buffer
12:30  spiiph: Slice?!?
12:30  daniel: that's the only solution i can come up with, which is not optimal, since the current buffer might as well not be a file
12:31  mgedmin: hm, :exec "tabnew | buf " . bufnr(".")
12:31  mgedmin: inelegant, but seems to work
12:32  dwarder: sorry i meant split
12:32  dwarder: spiiph: split
12:32  spiiph: <C-w>T
12:32  wrd:  :sp ?
12:32  mgedmin: :tab split
12:32  mgedmin: actually
12:33  mgedmin: spiiph's solution is, unsurprisingly, the best
12:33  dwarder: thank you
12:33  spiiph: Can I have that as topic? :)
12:35  dwarder: i can type it with red letters: spiiph's solution is, unsurprisingly, the best
12:35  dwarder: :)
12:36  wrd: is there a beautiful way to access predefined variables in the lua extension?
12:48  ConsoleFx: vim.pastey.net is cool :) .. I was unaware of it!!!
12:55  iaj: is there actually someone doing java coding in vim?
12:56  wrd: iaj: sometimes, not very often
12:57  iaj: wrd: can u recommen it? most of the ppl advice me to use netbeans or eclipse with vimode instead.
12:57  ConsoleFx: eclipse is good for Java development... I would suggest to use Eclipse if it comes to Java development.. Its my personal opinion though
12:58  meiskam: yo, i just installed vim, and i'm using the numpad .. and it's inserting qrstuvwxy instead of 123456789
12:58  meiskam: how can i fix that?
12:58  spiiph: uh
13:00  wrd: iaj: well I'm used to working without an IDE. I once found eclim which you could look into. Its a matter of personal taste and how and where you develop. But I think give Eclipse a try.
13:00  meiskam: on a shell i'm using, the numpad works fine .. but on the vim i just installed it doesn't
13:00  mgedmin: meiskam, which terminal emulator do you use?
13:01  meiskam: i'm using bash, and term in a screen
13:01  mgedmin: screen as in GNU/screen?
13:01  mgedmin: does it work without?
13:01  meiskam: yeah
13:01  meiskam: uhmm, lemmie check
13:02  meiskam: same thing
13:02  meiskam: the numpad inserts letters, and a carriage return
13:03  meiskam: on the terminal it works fine, it's just inside vim that's the problem
13:03  meiskam: i'm using putty to connect to it .. is that a problem?
13:03  mgedmin: so what terminal emulator do you use (and I don't mean screen -- what are you running screen inside of?)?
13:05  meiskam: i believe putty uses xterm
13:06  mgedmin: ah, putty
13:07  mgedmin: putty tends to have a bunch of options for its term emulation, have you looked if there's something about the numpad?
13:07  meiskam: i use the same putty on 2 different servers, and it acts differently
13:07  meiskam: with the same settings
13:07  mgedmin: what does echo $TERM say? 'xterm' or 'putty'?
13:07  spiiph: What's the value of $TERM inside screen?
13:08  spiiph: (And outside, for that matter.)
13:08 * mgedmin bets it's 'screen' inside screen
13:08  spiiph: Probably
13:08  meiskam: inside the screen, it's screen ... outside it's xterm
13:08  spiiph: Hey, what do you know. I get the same thing
13:08  meiskam: but it acts the same in both
13:08  meiskam: even outside the screen, the numpad is messed up
13:08  spiiph: meiskam, I can reproduce it. I'll see if I can fix it.
13:08 * mgedmin doesn't really have a numpad 
13:10  meiskam: on the physical machine, the term is "linux" .. and the numpad works fine
13:11  meiskam: but normally i use putty to connect through ssh
13:11  mgedmin: yeah, if you had real xterm they might work fine too
13:11  mgedmin: or if you set $TERM=putty and installed the requisite ncurses-extras (or whatever) package that ships putty's terminfo entry
13:12  spiiph: I'm sure it's due to putty, but I'm not sure it's due to the TERM setting. I'll check.
13:12  meiskam: what i said earlier, is i use the same putty, on a different server .. the term is the same .. and the numpad works fine
13:13  mgedmin: I'm confused: vim's help lists t_KC as the option for numpad 0, e.g.
13:13  mgedmin: but :set t_KC? says there's no such option here
13:13  spiiph: Yeah, I can't set that option either.
13:13  mgedmin: and infocmp -C1 |grep KC finds nothing
13:13  spiiph: meiskam, with $TERM=putty-256color, the numpad works fine.
13:14  mgedmin: wait, I do have a numpad
13:14  spiiph: The same should be true for $TERM=putty. You can check if that works for you too.
13:15  meiskam: yep, works
13:15  mgedmin: apparently gnome-terminal sends plain old ascii '0', '1', ... '9' for numpad keys
13:15  spiiph: Well, we've concluded several times that gnome-terminal is shit. :D
13:15  meiskam: spiiph i set term to putty, and it worked ... so why does xterm work on a different server?
13:16  spiiph: meiskam, not sure. What distributions do your servers use?
13:16  meiskam: mine is slackware .. the other one is debian
13:17  meiskam: on the debian, the keypad works on xterm ... and on the slackware it doesn't
13:17  spiiph: The only thing I can think of is that the xterm terminfo entries differ.
13:18  mgedmin: you can compare the output of infocmp -l xterm on both servers
13:18  meiskam: well yeah they are different
13:18  meiskam: but i have no idea what this all means
13:19  meiskam: here i'll pastebin it :P
13:20  meiskam: http://pastebin.com/eFjqQQaq
13:20  meiskam: first one (maple) is slackware, second (beetlejuice) is debian
13:21  mgedmin: which one works?
13:21  meiskam: second (beetlejuice)
13:22  mgedmin: oh, cool: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/PuTTY_numeric_keypad_mappings
13:23  meiskam: aha! that looks perfect
13:23  Silex: anyone knows how to make vim-gccsense also show the command parameters when autocompleting?
13:23  mgedmin: what's the terminfo name of the init sequence?
13:23  mgedmin: I bet one of those includes "switch to application keypad mode", and the other doesn't
13:24  meiskam: i don't know what that all means
13:24  meiskam: but, if you say so
13:26  meiskam: mgedmin, if i could add "switch to application keypad mode" to my terminfo .. that would be perfect
13:27  mgedmin: no, it would not be
13:27  mgedmin: do not mess with your distribution's terminfo database
13:27  mgedmin: turn of application keypad setting in putty, like the wiki suggests
13:27  mgedmin: s/of/off/
13:29  meiskam: grr, ok fine
13:29  meiskam: lol
13:29  mgedmin: taglist('^__init__$') takes 2-3 seconds every time
13:29  mgedmin: I have a lot of tags
13:29  mgedmin: I'd like to cache the resulting list in my plugin
13:29  mgedmin: how can I discover that vim has reloaded the tags file so I can invalidate my cache?

13:35  mgedmin: woot!
13:35  mgedmin: http://pastie.org/1205058
13:35  nkvorn: can i have 3 equal :vs wins at once?
13:35  mgedmin: my show-function-or-constructor-signature-when-I-type-( is now fast!
13:35  mgedmin: nkvorn, press <C-W>=
13:36  mgedmin: to make all windows be the same size
13:36  jamessan: mgedmin: Vim doesn't reload the tags file. it searches it every time
13:37  nkvorn: mgedmin: it works but the prob is i have minibuf explorer that gets resized also...
13:37  nkvorn: any way to resize only verticaly..
13:37  jamessan: s/that gets.*// :p
13:38  mgedmin: nkvorn, set 'winfixwidth'/'winfixheight' on the minibuf explorer window
13:39 * mgedmin rephrases his question as "how can I discover that the tags file has changed so I can invalidate my cache", and notes that his pastebin has a valid solution for that
13:43  nkvorn: mgedmin: i'll try that. thanx
13:45  meiskam: mgedmin, thanks .. i've got putty setup and it works correctly now
13:50  iaj: when I use execute in vim script... which quotes do I need to use and embedd the term following afterwards with?
13:50  mgedmin: either '' or ""
13:50  mgedmin: quoting rules differ for these
13:51  iaj: well... I'm trying to use execute 'match Keyword /^\(.... '
13:51  iaj: would that work?
13:51  mgedmin: I don't see why not
13:51  mgedmin: but the string you're executing is constant, why use execute at all?
13:53  iaj: mgedmin: actually I'm just trying to use a function I found on the web :)
13:53  iaj: it looks lke:
13:53  mgedmin: pastebin!
13:53  iaj: its just a oneliner
13:53  iaj:     execute 'match Keyword /^\([^,]*,\){`,a:x.`}\zs[^,]*/'
13:53  mgedmin: that's not a function, that's a single command
13:53  iaj: but I guess the ` ` needs to be replaced
13:53  iaj: I know.
13:53  iaj: but its inside a function :)
13:54  mgedmin: are you trying to interpolate a:x inside the string?
13:54  mgedmin: use :execute 'match ... ' . a:x . '...'
13:54  iaj: I dunno it ought to highlight a certain column in a csv file
13:54  iaj: at the end... Cheers, thanks - mgedmin 
13:55  aljosa: i'm using gvim 7.2 (ubuntu package 7.2.330-1ubuntu3) and my colors started mixing but can't figure out why. maybe some bug? any ideas?
13:56  iaj: mgedmin: what's that a:x doing btw?
13:56  mgedmin: it's the value of the function argument named 'x'
13:56  iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/272177   .. this is my final result but it doesn't work out - as it should..
13:57  iaj: nevermind.
14:09  sie: Is it possible to make vim have only one instance of itself? i.e. I open second vim, and it just opens new tab in the old one.
14:17  mgedmin: sie, see vim --remote
14:20  sie: mgedmin, I start one with --servername, right?
14:20  mgedmin: no; each vim automatically becomes a server
14:20  sie: Oh.
14:20  mgedmin: servername defaults to VIM (then VIM1, VIM2, ...)
14:21  mgedmin: or GVIM/GVIM1/GVIM2/...
14:21  mgedmin: if you try vim --remote filename, it will tell the already-running vim to open file
14:21  mgedmin: if there's no already-running vim server, that command will start one
14:22  sie: That's so awesome, thanks.
14:26  aep: yand/paste is not part of recording?
14:26  aep: is there something to duplicate a line then, that _is_ recorded?
14:27  spiiph: ?
14:28  aep: well, a yand paste operation seems to be excluded when recording a macro
14:28  aep: *yank
14:28  spiiph: They are not.
14:29  spiiph: You can verify by doing something like qayypq"ap
14:29  aep: ohhm, that works
14:29  aep: mebbe i did something else wrong. thanks
14:39  sie: mgedmin, It opens the new file in the current tab, not makes a new one — any ideas how to fix it?

15:06  sie: How to make 256-* colorthemes work right in gvim?
15:08  spiiph: sie, they should work out of the box, provided they set guifg and guibg colours
15:09  sie: Hmm, when I set oceanblack256, it's all white. ;-D
15:09  spiiph: So open the file and check what it says
15:10  sie: They don't. :< I need some other theme, then.

15:14  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ie, I want to check the range for a :<range>s/
15:15  spiiph: KeeperOfTheSoul_, just select the range and hit :
15:15  spiiph: You'll get the marks
15:16  KeeperOfTheSoul_: spiiph: I mean I was going to do :<range>s/ but was unsure I was using the correct range
15:17  KeeperOfTheSoul_: spiiph: so wanted to do something like :<range>V first to see what the range was
15:17  iaj: :10,20 normal V  ? like that??
15:18 --- sora_h is now known as sorah_off
15:18 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
15:19  KeeperOfTheSoul_: hmm, that isn't selecting the range for me
15:20  KeeperOfTheSoul_: ah, its trying to to V for each line rather than the range, doh
15:21  spiiph: You could do 10GV20G
15:22  KeeperOfTheSoul_: in this case though its things like; 'm,'n or .,$
15:24  iaj: KeeperOfTheSoul_: strange for me its visually selecting all those lines.
15:26  jink: What's that syntax again?  I want to search backward for _2 and then land on the 2.  Find this and then find that.
15:26  iaj: jink: maybe ?_\zs2   ?
15:27  jink: That's not the syntax I meant, but it works, so thanks. :D
15:27  iaj: Sorry.
15:29  KeeperOfTheSoul_: I'm on 7.2 in case that matters, since I see 7.3 has come out
15:31  KeeperOfTheSoul_: jink: perhaps you were thinking of ?_s?e
15:36 --- sora_h is now known as sorah_off

16:24  TAsn-work: which is probably what you want (because you want to save all buffers, I assume, and not just the current.
16:24  deputydink: Silex, i think you want  :w | make
16:25  Silex: TAsn-work, deputydink: thanks
16:25  TAsn-work: np.
16:25  ggergely: hi. vim leaves swapfiles around the fs. how can i check the value of a variable (backup?)
16:30  iaj: can someone help me - I want to have a command that calls a function with an argument - how would I do so? I tried command! TEST(x) :call TESTFun(x)<CR>
16:30  iaj: but this one is obviously wrong ;\
16:30  spiiph: :h :command
16:33  Silex: KeeperOfTheSoul_: I'm might be telling bs, but maybe you can go d/\v(NONCAPTURING,.)
16:33  Silex: except I have no idea how to tell a non-capturing group in vim
16:34  iaj: spiiph: hmm thanks I was looking into there found out about -nargs=1 but how can I pass that to the function?
16:36  Araxia: ggergely: :set backup?
16:37  iaj: spiiph: Ah I think <f-args> does the job.
16:38  spiiph: Yes
16:39  ggergely: Araxia: it does not print anything
16:39  ggergely: how can i qeuery the value of backup?
16:40  Araxia: ggergely: did you type it just like that? ":set backup?"
16:40  ggergely: oh no
16:40  ggergely: not the ?
16:42  ggergely: i have the default nobacup writebackup settings
16:42  ggergely: but still .swp files get left behind often
16:42  ggergely: should it not be deleted when recovering?
16:42  ggergely: i cannot think any other cause..
16:42  Araxia: KeeperOf1heSoul_: "df,x" is pretty straightforward, isn't it?
16:44  Araxia: ggergely: have you looked at :help 'swapfile'
16:44  Araxia: or :help 'directory'
16:46  Araxia: :recover does not delete the swap file automatically.
16:47  ggergely: Araxia: so i should :swf after recovery
16:47  spiiph: ggergely, they get left behind because Vim is not exited in a controlled manner, while you have unsaved files. :h 'swap
16:49  KeeperOfTheSoul_: Silex: ah, didn't know / could be used as a motion like that
16:50  KeeperOfTheSoul_: Silex: so; d/,/e+1 works perfectly
16:51  KeeperOfTheSoul_: shame viemu doesn't seem to support //e
16:54  Benkinooby: if i see a function used, is there a way to jump to the code where that function gets implemented (might be in a different file)?
16:56  frogonwheels: Benkinooby: you can use ctags to do that
16:57  Benkinooby: frogonwheels, thx
16:57  frogonwheels: Benkinooby: (you use it the same as you do to navigate the :help system)
17:00  buddhabrot: hello, I was wondering if anyone knew of something that I could use to easily create class-diagram-like things in Vim
17:00  buddhabrot: not totally accurate UML or anything.. just something to brainstorm ideas with in a hierarchical manner
17:00  mgedmin: drawit.vim, perhaps, for ascii-art
17:00  buddhabrot: like the TODO list but with interrelations
17:01  buddhabrot: drawit is too slow
17:01  Araxia___: buddhabrot: how about a wiki? vimwiki is great for brainstorming.
17:02  buddhabrot: never heard of it
17:02  buddhabrot: can you be sloppy with it?
17:03  Araxia___: buddhabrot: I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that, but I'm guessing the answer is yes.
17:03  buddhabrot: heh
17:04  buddhabrot: I'm checking i tout
17:04  buddhabrot: I just meant I don't want to think about syntax or anything, I just want to write away and hide/show stuff
17:04  buddhabrot: and link ideas together
17:06  Araxia___: yeah. that's exactly it. there is *some* syntax, of course, but it can be very minimal. WikiWords or [[bracketedwords]] is really all you need.
17:11  abstrakt: buddhabrot: vim outliner?
17:13  buddhabrot: thanks I'll try this vimwiki first
