01:06  peth: if there are dmenu users on here could you confirm for me that ctrl+y in dmenu works for other apps but not from vim?
01:07  peth: term vim that is. gvim works too.
01:08  peth: oh, must be in my vimrc. works with -u NONE. o_O
01:09  bairui: peth: you could try   :verbose map <c-y>
01:09  peth: bairui: ah, no. i visually select in vim expecting it to fill my primary x selection, then ctrl+y to paste in dmenu.
01:10  peth: so the <c-y> is not for vim.
01:11  bairui: right, but your <c-y> works when no vimrc or plugins are loaded, so I was thinking there might be a vim map for <c-y> in there somewhere.
01:11  peth: but... vim doesn't have the focus :)
01:11  bairui: yeah - it's probably errant thinking :)
01:12  bairui: why would vim not have the focus if you just created a visual selection...?
01:12  peth: because i then opened dmenu (which grabbed the focus) and i'm trying to paste there
01:12  bairui: meh, i don't know what dmenu is, so I'll just hush up. :)
01:12  bairui: ok
01:12  peth: it's another program to show user menus/execute commands
01:13  bairui: so - dmenu's ctrl-y pastes from.... what? the primary X or the clipboard?
01:13  peth: primary afaik but i tried both anyway
01:13  peth: must be something in my vimrc that changes where my selection goes
01:14  bairui: you might have 'clipboard' set
01:14  bairui: Have a look at section 13 in :options
01:15  bairui: or 'mouse'
01:15  bairui: (section 9)
01:15  peth: i'm on it, thanks. it's weird really, i pretty much know by heart what i have in there and can't think of anything...
01:17  bairui: so, peth, you might know what's in your vimrc, but   -u NONE   also skips plugins.  Try   -u NORC
01:18  peth: ah, didn't know about that one. but no, works too. so it's definitely my fault. :)
01:18  bairui: hehe
01:19  bairui: binary search...? :-/
01:22  peth: how odd. i think i'll have to start commenting out.
01:23  bairui: hence the binary search
01:26  peth: wasn't sure if you meant that, but seems to be the way now. :/

01:47  peth: something is very wrong here. it *is* "set mouse=a"... clipboard is on the default setting ("clipboard=autoselect,exclude:cons\|linux") though.
01:48  peth: weirder still, i *can* select in the same vim and paste to an arbitrary other app. just not dmenu. then selecting the just pasted text, i *can* paste that in dmenu.
01:48  peth: i don't get it.
01:48  bairui: with the mouse option, vim takes over the management of the mouse. :help clipboard and read the last paragraph. Maybe that will help?
01:50  peth: you mean the "Note:" one?

14:14  marinosi: hello all. trying to enable a colorscheme inside a colored terminal (256) fails and I have completely uncolored buffers(the setup works fine with gvim). Any ideas? What I should check first?
14:17  wooden: marinosi: Is it a 256-color colorscheme, or a gvim colorscheme?
14:19  marinosi: wooden: both -- it's popular molokai it has a condition to apply to 256 color terminals too.
14:19  marinosi: it works in linux, but not in my fbsd -- no idea what to check first
14:22  wooden: marinosi: What is $TERM?
14:23  marinosi: wooden: by default it gets rxvt although it should get rxvt-unicode-256color. I;ve manually set the latter and xterm-color. ls coloring works with all except rxvt-unicode-256color(strange eh?)
14:25  wooden: marinosi: What is your $TERM under Linux where this all works?
14:25  marinosi: rxvt-unicode-256color
14:34  wooden: marinosi: Maybe your BSD terminfo doesn't have an rxvt-unicode-256color entry.
14:35  wooden: marinosi: Messing with $TERM is never a good idea, but try setting it to xterm-256color.

15:25  ormaaj: is there a setting to group buffers by tab so that :ls shows the local collection of buffers and :bn/:bp cycle through a per-tab buffer list?
15:40  spiiph: No
15:40  spiiph: Buffers and tabs are completely disconnected
15:40  spiiph: Buffers do not belong totabs.
15:40  strull_: the whole tab-handling is very rudimentary
15:40  ormaaj: heh
15:41  ormaaj: so tabs are essentially useless unless you happen to have lots of window arrangements to keep track of
15:41  spiiph: No
15:41  spiiph: Tabs are excellent when you want two separate views into a project
15:42  ormaaj: views?
15:42  spiiph: Great for diffing as well.
15:43  spiiph: Yes, say you have your source files viewed mainly in one tab, and in another one you use for, say, resource files
15:43  ormaaj: But only one buffer can be bound to a window at a time so unless you have loads of splits in each tab it doesn't let you group those
15:44  spiiph: I always have at least two windows, often 3-6
15:45  spiiph: In each tab
15:55  mopd: is there any way to autoinstall plugins merely by specifying the name.. kind of like cpan for perl?
16:00  spiiph: There are som attempts in that direction
16:02  spiiph: https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager
16:02  ormaaj: mopd: Nope, vim plugins are a totall disorganized mess unless they happen to be managed by your PM. Best bet is to find em on github and pathogen
16:03  ormaaj: I symlink em into a directory sourced by vim-pathogen so they're easy to toggle like that.
16:03  mopd: yeah github would have been awesome except that one or two plugins aren't on it eg:vim-aglist
16:03  mopd:  err taglist

16:57  philluminati: squeeky: Try :set nolist

17:39  nicark: Is it possible to set up omnicompletition so that you don't have to press ctrl+n i.e. apply omnicompletition on the fly as you write code. Is it a bad idea to set it up like that?
17:43  _rane: how would it work then?
17:48  nicark: I meant completition perhaps, sorry. I think that in textmate as you write a menu shows up showing possible completitions i.e. you write for and it shows up a menu with options for, format_arg, etc. Is it possible to do this in vim? I'm just wondering, actually I'm fine with just using ctrl+n.
17:49  _rane: textmate doesn't do that

19:57  Raimondi: I don't play with Python, so no idea, sorry.
19:58 * mgedmin lives without \v
19:59  mgedmin: vim's regexps are different from anything else, making them superficially more similar with \v is just going to cause subtle confusion when you attempt to use more advanced features

20:03  mgedmin: when I want to insert blank lines in multiple places

20:04 * mgedmin shrugs
20:04  mgedmin: same number of keystrokes
20:04  fow: I suppose, assuming a blank line is near
20:04  spiiph: You could have a dedicated seldom used register for blank lines

21:22  AzaToth: I usually got a number of viewports active when I work, and I mostly uses gvim; though I have a habit of open any new document in an new gvim instance, which might become cumbersome after a time. I've looked for solutions to allow opening new files into existing buffer, but none I've found have handle the posibillity to open in the instance in the current viewport, nor without adding some extra arguments when launching. Does anyone (if you understand my
21:22  AzaToth: question) have any suggestions?
21:24  homekevin: AzaToth: I assume by "viewports" you mean windows, and by "buffer" you mean something other than a buffer.

22:07  elm2: ":Man open" does not work at me.What can I do or what is wrong about it?Why or how can I not simply paste the content of a manpage with :r into a buffer of my desire?
22:07  iaj: fow: i got ts=sts=sw =4
22:09  iaj: fow: nevermind somehow it works with ts 8.
22:09  fow: strange
22:11  mgedmin: elm2, define "does not work", please
22:12  elm2: no editor command: Man open
22:12  mgedmin: if you get E492: Not an editor command, you need to :runtime ftplugin/man.vim
22:14  elm2: what is the difference between :source *.vim and :runtime *.vim?
22:14  elm2: I have always been using :source.
22:14  iaj: how can I get the last command line to my inserting buffer...?
22:15  homekevin: Hey, that :Man thingy is kind of cool.
22:15  mgedmin: :source takes a path relative to $PWD
22:15  mgedmin: :runtime looks in vim's runtime directories
22:15  mgedmin: (all of them)
22:15  njbair: when doing a search/replace in vim, how do I specify a line break?
22:15  homekevin: njbair: \r
22:15  mgedmin: njbair, \n in the search pattern, \r in the replacement string
22:15  homekevin: njbair: Wait, for the search part or the replace part?
22:16  njbair: replacement
22:16  njbair: i thought \r was a windows line break
22:16  elm2: only difference? the doku says: read ex/vim commands: what is the difference betw. ex & vim commands?
22:16  elm2: \r makes the cursor return to the first column
22:17  walt: njbair: \r\n is windows. \r was MacOS, \n is unix
22:17  walt: afaik
22:17  Araxia_: iaj: q:kyy<C-c><C-c>p
22:17  elm2: \r is the ctrl character produced by the return key
22:17  homekevin: njbair: Not relevant to Vim.
22:17  njbair: ok
22:17  mgedmin: the topic of \r and \n is a long and complicated one
22:17  mgedmin: I don't have the energy to go into it on a sunday night
22:18  walt: njbair: a newline can be written by pressing Ctrl-r, then return
22:18  elm2: line breaks: windows: \r\n, Linux: \r
22:18  elm2: Linux \n
22:18  homekevin: njbair: Vim doesn't care about the linebreak style until it's writing the file. Internally it stores individual lines without any specific breaks.
22:18  elm2: I mean
22:18  iaj: Araxia_: haha.. ok.. i tried <C_R>:  but that was something else :)   i don't wanna fall into the C-c habit tho:)
22:18  Araxia_: iaj: in this case, it's just to dismiss the cmdline-window.
22:19  iaj: Araxia_: hehe:)
22:19  Araxia_: iaj: you could use j<CR> instead.
22:20  iaj: thnx!
22:20  Araxia_: instead of <C-c><C-c> in that sequence, just to be clear. :-)
22:26  tonymec: To insert the latest ex-command (without the colon) at the normal-mode cursor:       ":p     or for insert mode:      ^R:    where ^R means "hit Ctrl-R". See ":help registers", ":help quote_:" ":help i_CTRL-R" etc.
22:27  Araxia_: tonymec: ah, that's so much better. knew there must be a more efficient way.
22:28 --- batrick_ is now known as batrick
22:29  iaj: tonymec: hmm.. that's strange i tried C_r : actually - but it got me the excommand BEFORE the current one -_-
22:30  Araxia_: well, the cmdline-window method lets you pick and choose. you could even grab a few lines of history.
22:30  tonymec: iaj: in command-line mode, the ex-command you are now typing isn't yet stored -- is this what you mean?
22:31  iaj: tonymec: actually I hit <CR> after the ex mode.
22:33  tonymec: iaj: well, in Insert mode (when editing text in a file) Ctrl-R followed by colon should insert the latest ex-command without its colon. In command-line mode (when typing an ex-command after the colon), Ctrl-R followed by colon should insert the latest *complete* ex-command you executed before the one you're in the process of typing.
22:36  tonymec: ...still without its colon. By "complete" I meant: "which you already executed by hitting Return at its end.
22:38  tonymec: an empty ex-colon (i.e. hit colon then Enter in Normal mode) doesn't count./
22:38  tonymec: s/ex-colon/ex-command
22:40  papaganoush: Good day. I am going to try vim for the first time in ages (as a possible replacement for textmate). after I finish the :help tutor what should be the next thing(s) I do?
22:40  iaj: hmm yeah.. I got that command to excommand by hitting : <C-P> a few times - mb that's the problem
22:43  Araxia_: papaganoush: there are a fair number of blog posts about switching from textmate to vim. might be worth looking at some of those for ideas. there are quite a few plugins that provide textmate-like capabilities, e.g. command-t.vim and snipMate.vim.
22:44  Araxia_: papaganoush: what are you going to be editing primarily?
22:45  papaganoush: ruby
22:45  tonymec: iaj: ah, I see. To insert an arbitrary ex-command from history, open the command-line window by    q:    , yank the line you want, close the cmdline-window (e.g. by    :q    ) and put it wherever you want it.
22:45  Araxia_: papaganoush: you'll want to grab some of the excellent ruby plugins, too, then.
22:46  fow: you might like this, papaganoush http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/
22:46  fow: I think the author occasionally visits this channel as sjl
22:46  iaj: tonymec: that's Araxia_'s post as well
22:46  iaj: fow: damn! I like that post, and was just crawling through my bookmarks :(
22:46  Araxia_: heh. the circle completes.
22:46  fow: haha
22:48  tonymec: one difference apparently is that Araxia_ closes the cmdline-windo by Ctrl-C, I use :q instead.
22:49  Araxia_: tonymec: that's partly a habit of using <C-c> for <Esc> in most cases.
22:49  Araxia_: and in this case <Esc> wouldn't work. :-)
22:51 --- jlewis_ is now known as jlewis
22:52  papaganoush: thanks! I look at the coming home to vim and see what ruby plugins I can find.
23:09  rindolf: https://wincent.com/products/command-t - this looks cool. I've watched the first screencast.
23:09  Araxia_: rindolf: yeah, it works pretty well.
23:12  Araxia_: my only complaint about it so far is that there is not a native way to hjkl navigate the completion list.
23:27  rindolf: Araxia_: it crashed. :-D
23:27  rindolf: Araxia_: I mean vim with command-t.vim.
23:27  gma: can anybody give me a hint with these mappings – http://pastebin.com/2EPMhBY7
23:27  rindolf: I'll see if I can reproduce it.
23:27  gma: I want to modify splits as well as resize the window (in macvim)
23:27  Araxia_: rindolf: ugh. never had that happen to me. which vim version?
23:28  rindolf: Araxia_: latest hg.
23:28  rindolf: 7.3.x
23:28  Araxia_: rindolf: so just in the console, then?
23:28  rindolf: Araxia_: no, gvim.
23:28  Araxia_: rindolf: platform?
23:29  rindolf: Araxia_: Linux x86 (P4-2.4GHz)
23:29  rindolf: Araxia_: can no longer reproduce it.
23:29  Araxia_: rindolf: yay. an intermittent crash.
23:30  rindolf: But I don't recall exactly what I did.
23:31  Araxia_: gma: it might be a bit tricky to preserve the same custom proportions in your splits when you resize the windows. you could use :wincmd = to redistribute space evenly to the splits after the window resize, though.
23:32  rindolf: Araxia_: OK, I got it to crash again.
23:32  gma: Araxia_: thanks, I didn't know about that. I'm struggling at the moment to get the ,2 to actually introduce a split though. my first paste had <leader>w o, which I've now realised should have been <C-w> o, but it still isn't doing anything
23:32  gma: (paste updated)
23:32  gma: http://pastebin.com/iT1XG5kn
23:33  Araxia_: gma: you need to get ride of the spaces after the <c-w>s
23:33  gma: ah!
23:33  Araxia_: and after the <CR>
23:33  Araxia_: maps are very literal.
23:33  Araxia_: well, vim is, really.
23:33  gma: Araxia_: brilliant, that works. thanks muchly!
23:39  iaj: hmm. i got a problem after some text editing - my CR key ain't working anymore.. when I check on my commandline and hit <CR> there I see the following: <SNR>47_onCommandPre()
23:39  iaj: where's that thing coming from :\
23:40  Araxia_: iaj: :verbose map <CR>
23:40  danielsh: iaj: :scriptnames and look for number 47
23:40  iaj: no mapping found Araxia_ :(
23:41  iaj: oh.. cmap had it - lustyjuggler :\
