10:31  jww: hello
10:31  marlun: can I just do a unmap to make a key works as it would by default if I havn't mapped it?
10:31  marlun: or will it remove the default mapping too=
10:31  Raimondi: malfy: map <expr> <CR> &buftype == 'quickfix' ? '<CR> : <C-]>
10:32  Raimondi: malfy: Missing quotes there:  map <expr> <CR> &buftype == 'quickfix' ? '<CR>' : '<C-]>'
10:33  Raimondi: That was for marlun :(
10:36  iaj: hey folks :-)
10:36  jww: pI got a small problem with vim, I was playing with some diff commands, now I got 2 empty columns at the left, I can't remove/edit . can somebody help please ?
10:36  jww: Hi even.
10:38  Silex: I'm trying to find where is <S-down> mapped, because in my vim it selects lines. I tried :vector map <S-down> without success
10:38  jww: note that it do that only on the file I had open at this time.
10:38  Silex: *:verbose
10:38  Silex: how do I list the mappings?
10:38  strull_: jww: try :set nodiff
10:39  Raimondi: Silex: That's an option.
10:39  Raimondi: I think  :h 'slm'
10:40  jww: strull_: it doesn't help :\
10:40  strull_: try :set fdc=0
10:40  marlun: Raimondi: Works great, thanks, but I was thinking if it wouldn't be better to add somehow as a autocmd since if I find yet another place where I want <cr> to works as normal the expression will get complex?
10:40  Silex: Raimondi: ah you're right, what's weird is that this is triggered by "behave mswin" then, but when I do it on my *nix box it doens't behave the same as on my windows box
10:40  jww: strull_: the command I used is : command DiffOrig vert new | set bt=nofile | r # | 0d_ | diffthis | wincmd p | diffthis
10:40  Silex: Raimondi: I'll investigate, thanks
10:41  jww: strull_: victory :) thanks !
10:41  jww: strull_++
10:44  ]Matic[: hello
10:44  Raimondi: marlun: You can precede that command with this:  au FileType cpp,python
10:45  ]Matic[: i used to use vim on linux for years. Now i'm on windows and found it a little different. Is there some option that I should set to make vim behave like on linux ?
10:45  Raimondi: malfy: Missing quotes there:  au FileType cpp,python map <expr><buffer> <CR> &buftype == 'quickfix' ? '<CR>' : '<C-]>'
10:46  ]Matic[: for instance, when i'm on insert mode i cannot erase previous character with backspace but the ones i type
10:46  Raimondi: malfy: Sorry, if you use the autocmd you don't need the &buftype test, just set the mapping you want with <buffer>
10:47  Raimondi: malfy:  au FileType cpp,python map <buffer> <CR> <C-]>
10:49  marlun: Raimondi: yeasterday someones limit was 3 charaters before hitting TAB, your seems to be 2 :P
10:50  Raimondi: Again! sorry guys, it 3:50 am, maybe my brain is telling to go to bed :)
10:50  Raimondi: Have fun!
10:53  Silex: Raimondi: weird, I have 'slm' and 'keymodel' to the right options, yet when I use shift-j or shift-down over ssh nothing is selected. What's funny is that if I do shift-j it seems to remove endlines?!
10:53  Raimondi: J joins lines
10:53  Anchakor: hi, is there a way to store a recorded vim macro?
10:56  marlun: Raimondi: no worries, thanks for helping me!
11:17  marlun: Anchakor: What do you mean by store? So it exists after you've restarted vim?

12:04  iaj: is there an alternative to that netrw plugin? :\
12:04  hoodoos: hello, guys, i just started to use gvim and I have a problem with plugin installing, i put everything to ~/.vim/plugin directory and docs to ~/.vim/doc/ but vim doesn't seem to know about existing of this place, where do I neet to setup VIMPATH variable to make it look in there?
12:06  hoodoos: anyone? :)
12:15 --- chrischambers_ is now known as chrischambers
12:26  sitaktif: which plugin
12:26  spiiph: hoodoos, vim should look there automatically
12:27  sitaktif: hoodoos: sometimes it has not to be put in plugin folder but in autoload/   or  after/plugin/
12:28  hoodoos: sitaktif, i was doing as said in plugin's readme
12:29  spiiph: hoodoos, what does :set runtimepath? say?
12:30  hoodoos: spiiph, it says that yes he looks to ~/.vim too :)
12:30  spiiph: Then that's not the problem.
12:30  spiiph: Check :scriptnames
12:31  hoodoos: lists needed pluging as I see
12:32  hoodoos: spiiph, i just installed NERD_tree plugin, I wonder how to run this tree..
12:32  spiiph: Well, does it appear in :scriptnames?
12:32  hoodoos: /home/hoodoos/.vim/plugin/NERD_tree.vim like that
12:33  spiiph: And you should start answering the questions precisely, not just say what you believe the result to mean.
12:33  spiiph: Yes, then NERD_tree is loaded
12:33  sitaktif: hoodoos: do you have   set nocp  in your .vimrc
12:33  hoodoos: sitaktif, nope
12:33  spiiph: sitaktif, why do you think that's important in this case?
12:34  spiiph: hoodoos, nevermind that, did you try any of the actual NERD_tree commands?
12:34  hoodoos: spiiph, i wonder how to look them up :)
12:34  sitaktif: spiiph: if vim is set to vi-compatible plugins are not sourced are they ? (anyway yeah I did not follow the fact that the plugin is loaded :/ )
12:34  sitaktif: :NERD<tab>
12:34  hoodoos: i can't seem to read help like that:  :help NERD_tree.txt, but ~/.vim/doc/ has this file
12:35  spiiph: sitaktif, 'compatible' doesn't affect plugin loading
12:35  sitaktif: spiiph: ok, thx
12:35  spiiph: hoodoos, you have to run :helptags ~/.vim/doc/*
12:35  hoodoos: can i place something like that in .vimrc?
12:36  spiiph: No, don't.
12:36  spiiph: You only have to run it once.
12:37  hoodoos: works! but without * on the end :)
12:39  hoodoos: spiiph, is there anyway to make sure my syntax vim is eaten by vim?
12:40  spiiph: I don't understand
12:41  hoodoos: spiiph, look, i have a ~/.vim/syntax/javascript.vim, how can I make sure that vim loaded that file?
12:41  hoodoos: and uses it for js files?
12:42  spiiph: Put :filetype plugin indent on and :syntax on in your .vimrc
12:44  hoodoos: btw, is tehre anyway to make vim save last state when I quit it? like windows positions and opened files?
12:45  spiiph: :h :mksession
12:45  hoodoos: thanks!
12:51  hoodoos: i wonder if I can add some actions on new tab opening, I would love to automaticly run :NERDTree, i wonder it would be useful still :)
12:56  spiiph: Before you go ahead you should read this:
12:56  spiiph: vimgor, buffers
12:56  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
12:56  spiiph: and this:
12:56  spiiph: vimgor, tabs
12:56  vimgor: Tab pages are not buffers, don't try to force them to act like buffers. Consider tab pages like viewports, layouts, or workspaces. Trying to setup 1 tab page == 1 buffer is an exercise in futility. Do ':set hidden' and get started. Get FuzzyFinder, LustyExplorer or BufExplorer to make getting around your buffers easier. See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Tabs for more info.
12:56  Altreus: What's the magic button for going to the opening brace of the current block?
12:57  Altreus: as opposed to the previous occurrence of { which is Not Right
12:57  spiiph: Altreus, try [{
12:58  hoodoos: vimgor, spiiph , thanks! it's new world to expolore :)
12:58  vimgor: I don't have a clue, hoodoos.
12:58  hoodoos: vimgor, hm? about what? :)
12:59  vimgor: No idea, hoodoos.
12:59  hoodoos: lol
12:59  hoodoos: :D
12:59  Altreus: okay
12:59  hoodoos: yeah, i'm an idiot, will keep silent :)
13:00  Altreus: spiiph: bingo! thanks
13:00  Altreus: man there's always something to learn in vim
13:01  hoodoos: Altreus, sounds horrible :)
13:02  Altreus: hoodoos: we never know everything!
13:02  Altreus: mortals I mean
13:02  hokapoka: How do I use scp to open a file that have a space in it's path?
13:03  dunz0r: Space becomes "\ "
13:03  hokapoka: I' tried using :e scp://host//path\ with\ space/file.ext but it's trying to open /path
13:03  ldvx: When you make a vertical split for instance, a line with | appears, for me this is white on black (like showed in this screenshot: http://ompldr.org/vNXRqeQ/1.jpg). Does the bg color can be changed? If it can, what's the name of the variable I should edit in a vim theme?
13:04  hokapoka: dunz0r: that's what I thought, but I cant' quite get it right.
13:04  jamessan: ldvx: VertSplit
13:06  hokapoka: I've tried to use quotes, and quotes with "\ " but no cide.
13:06  hokapoka: s/cice/dice
13:08  hokapoka: I know the best solution is to "don't use spaces" but sometimes it's not up to me.  I guess I could use a simlink on the host to map the path to one w/o a space.
13:08  hokapoka: Would liek to know how to open file via scp that have spaces though.
13:10  rdpate: hokapoka: I didn't know you could use uri syntax with :e, but if that's what it is, try %20
13:10 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
13:10  ldvx: jamessan: that worked perfectly. Thanks a lot.
13:11  jamessan: hokapoka: scp host:foo\\\ bar .
13:11  malfy: c.vim doesnt seem to honour my tabstop setting. workaround?
13:12  jamessan: malfy: 'tabstop' isn't what matters
13:12  jamessan: 'shiftwidth' is what defines how many columns to indent
13:12  jamessan: vimgor: indent
13:12  vimgor: For a quick overview of Vim's indentation settings, see http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code
13:12  marlun: Does vim scripting have a naming conventions for functions in scripts?
13:12  marlun: should I call them method_name of methodName?
13:12  malfy: jamessan: my shiftwidth is the same as my tabstop
13:16  jamessan: malfy: then you'll have to explain what you mean by not honoring your indentation settings
13:21  malfy: jamessan: my 'tab' moves 4 places, c.vim seems to move by 8
13:22  jamessan: malfy: that's because you have softtabstop=4 even though the other relevant setting is at 8
13:28  hokapoka: jamessan: Thanks.  It works using : scp://host//path\\\ with\\\ space/file.ext
13:29  hokapoka: Is it possible to enable tab compleation via :e scp://host//pa<TAB> ?
13:29  klaas111: hi; how do I jump to the location of the previous change?
13:32  iaj: :he changelist
13:33  zoran119: klaas111: g.
13:34  zoran119: klaas111: no it's not
13:34  zoran119: klaas111: '. or `.
13:35  klaas111: zoran119: thanks!
13:36  malfy: jamessan: just had to actually reload vimrc in my other tabs :P
13:37  zoran119: there is a way to move to last edited position and switch to insert mode at the same time... but i keep forgeting what it is...
13:38  estragib: gi
13:38  zoran119: gi ... that was it
13:38  zoran119: estragib: just figured it out... thanks
13:38  estragib: :)

16:10  jimf: hi. im trying to troubleshoot an issue i'm having where pydoc.vim hangs macvim. i've narrowed it down to "filetype plugin on" in my vimrc, and either removing that or removing man.vim in my $VIMRUNTIME solves the problem, but obviously neither are ideal. anyone have any insight?

18:18 --- Channel #vim was synced in 73 seconds
18:18  Somelauw: Is there any way to fold latex without using vimlatex?
18:18  mgedmin: I believe you can :h feature-list to find feature names and then --enable-featurename
18:19  joeytwiddle: Somelauw: if there is indentation, you can :set foldmethod=indent
18:19  Ebrahem: thanks mgedmin
18:20  jerojasro: Somelauw: :help tex-folding
18:20  joeytwiddle: Somelauw: or for {...} blocks you could try: :syn region myFold matchgroup=myDummy start="{" end="}" transparent fold
18:20  Somelauw: It works, but a lot of verbatim blocks aren't properly indented.
18:20  jerojasro: that is part of the standard vim install
18:21  Somelauw: jerojasro, the help page exists (I will read later)
18:22  Somelauw: joeytwiddle, so will that indent using { and }? Can I replace those by \begin{keyword} \end{keyword}?
18:22  joeytwiddle: you can certainly try, but the tex-folding might be more helpful
18:22  joeytwiddle: you might need to use \\ instead of \
18:23  jerojasro: joeytwiddle: it seems that it only folds sections/parts/etc
18:28  Somelauw: So I need top put :set fdm=syntax in my latex file? Can I just use the ftpplugin instead?
18:30  Walt: Is there an option or something to make vim automatically select the first alternative when showing the completion menu?
18:31  elik: list:longest
18:31  elik: in wildmode
18:32  jerojasro: Somelauw: yes you can
18:36  estragib: is there a way to make vim break lines the same way with 'list set as with 'nolist?
18:36  Walt: elik, hm, it doesnt seem to work. I still have to press C-n twice to get the first match
18:37  estragib: more precisely: i have set my breaking a certain way, but with 'list' set, vim breaks at chars again
18:48  kenda: how can i match in "=== foo ===" only the 'foo'? i'm using this in a syntax file
18:54  jerojasro: use the regexp === \zsfoo\ze ===
18:54  jerojasro: see the help for \zs and \ze
19:01  elik: Walt, :h 'wildmode and see what you prefer
19:01  kenda: jerojasro: thanks
19:01  Walt: elik, I solved it
19:01  Walt: thanks anyway
19:01  Walt: I had completeopt+=longest hidden away in a script.
19:02  elik: sorry, I thought you were talking about command completion
19:02  elik: but yeah, basically the same set of options
19:03  trapni: wrt syntax files: how do you declare a rule to match /regexps/ without colleding with the division (/) operator used twice in a line?
19:04  okayzed: trapni, does escaping a slash help? so any slashes you want, you'd write as \/ ?
19:05  mnemoc: hi, can you enlighten me why "# vim: set ai et ts=4 sw=4:" on the first line of a file recognized as ft=conf doesn't do any of the requested changes? (vim 7.2, no ~/.vimrc)
19:07  jerojasro: mnemoc: have you enabled the 'modeline' option
19:08  jerojasro: '?
19:08  mnemoc: o_O i didn't know it was "optional"
19:08  trapni: okayzed: hm. not really. consider a line like this: if ((value =~ /^some.*regexp$/) && (value2/1024/1024 > 0)) -- here we've two cases with a double-slash, one the regexp, and one a math expr with containing two divisions.
19:08  mnemoc: jerojasro: thanks a lot, now it works :D
19:08  jerojasro: it must be enabled. for security reasons, it is disabled on some distro's packages of vim
19:09  jerojasro: by default
19:09  okayzed: oh, really cool trapni
19:09  trapni: i'd like to highlight the /regexp/ but not the /1024/, which is part of value/1024/1024. :)
19:09  mnemoc: jerojasro: security? what harm can be done with it?
19:09  jerojasro: I don't have it that clear, really
19:10  mnemoc: :)
19:10  Walt: elik, I have another question. Something is setting my completion menu to start from the bottom and move upwards. What option is this_
19:10  Walt: ?
19:11  okayzed: trapni, can regexes have word characters next to them? i.e. is \w/abc/\w ever going to be valid?
19:11  okayzed: it seems like by nature of division, there is always a word character after each slash
19:12  okayzed: or close by?
19:12  trapni: hm
19:12 --- Unode is now known as _Unode
19:12  trapni: yeah
19:12  trapni: i'll try further then, thanks okayzed :)
19:12  okayzed: can you tell me if you figure it out? it looks cool
19:14 --- _Unode is now known as Unode
19:16  trapni: okayzed: lol, yeah :D
19:18  okayzed: oh, actually - can division happen with anything other than digits in your syntax?
19:18  okayzed: i guess it can, i see value2
19:18  trapni: okayzed: you can look yourself (in case you're interested in) to my syntax file a few days/moments later, it's in: http://github.com/trapni/flow/blob/master/contrib/flow.vim (i'll go into add /regexp/ highlighting support when i'm back home)
19:19  okayzed: cool - thanks
19:19  trapni: it can happen with any kind of expression. yes.
