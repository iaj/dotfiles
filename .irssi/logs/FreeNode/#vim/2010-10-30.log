00:36  jtaby_: same
00:36  jtaby_: maybe wrong nerdtree version?
00:36 --- Channel #vim was synced in 78 seconds
00:50  dsdeiz: is there like a vim plugin that manages folds? :D like functions are automatically 'foldable'?
00:54  dindinx: dsdeiz: there's no need for a plug-in to do that. Floding is built-in.
00:54  FernandoBasso: dsdeiz: If I am not mistaken, vim do that already.
00:54  FernandoBasso: Oh!
00:55  FernandoBasso: I mean, it can fold your functions.
00:55  mgedmin: if your syntax file defines folds for functions
00:55  mgedmin: and sets foldmethod=syntax
00:56  mgedmin: waaaugh why doesnt Ctrl-F indent the current line?
00:56  mgedmin: 'indentkeys' contains !^F
00:56  mgedmin: 'paste' is off
00:59  bairui: and, mgedmin, your indentexpr is not empty...?
00:59  mgedmin: it is empty
00:59  bairui: :help 'indentkeys'
01:00  bairui: says it only works when indentexpr isn't empty
01:00  mgedmin: ah!
01:00  Raimondi: jtaby_: I'm using the github of NERDTree
01:00  mgedmin: then the question is why is my indentexpr empty?
01:00  mgedmin: :verbose set indentexpr? doesn't blame any scripts
01:01  mgedmin: I'm pretty sure I haven't just decided to type :set indentexpr= for fun
01:01  mgedmin: so who/what cleared it?
01:01  bairui: you'd need to set it up - your indentation probably uses autoindent or cindent
01:01  bairui: when I say 'you' there, i mean it is dependent on your filetype - the indent plugin would set it up if it needed one
01:01  mgedmin: wait, this is not a code file
01:02  mgedmin: this is a plain text file
01:02  mgedmin: so obviously indentexpr is empty
01:02  bairui: so... you wouldn't *need* an indent plugin - autoindent is sufficient...
01:03  mgedmin: well, it's a text file with python doctest sections
01:03  mgedmin: and I guess I just assumed python indentation should Just Work inside those
01:04  bairui: nesting filetypes within a single file is notoriously hard in Vim...
01:06  Araxia: coming up empty trying to figure out how to determine if a buffer is dirty (has unwritten changes). ideas?
01:07  FernandoBasso: Can we open a new tab and make it be the 0th tab all in one time?
01:07  Raimondi: Araxia: :h 'modified'
01:07  FernandoBasso: Or, create a new tab at position 0 of the tab list.
01:07  FernandoBasso: :0tabnew
01:08  Araxia: Raimondi: heh. thx. i knew it was something simple like that. :-)
01:08  Raimondi: np :)
01:26  jink: estragib: And to think I had no idea "tac" existed. :P  Had to look it up.  So I learnt something new, too. :D
01:26  jbwiv_: anyone know of a plugin that will show a class browser for ruby? In other words, list methods, class vars, and instance vars (well, at least methods)
01:36  Benkinooby: if i am coding with vim, can i have something like "auto complete". like starting the first letters of a function, class, variable and then it will give me possible names?
01:36  LeoNerd: Ctrl-N
01:36  bairui: Benkinooby: <c-n> and <c-p>   :help ins-completion
01:37  Benkinooby: LeoNerd, bairui thx a lot.... still not used to the luxury of the vim help ;)
01:39  bairui: Benkinooby: learning to use Vim's help *is* learning to use Vim. It's all there. Jump in! Start with   :help-context  and then have a look at   :help quickref   and  :help usr_toc
01:40  Benkinooby: bairui, i know it... but still my first intention is th google end then ask in irc. i think it need some kind of practice and time to first look into man pages (if not related to vim) and vim help :)
01:40  Benkinooby: bairui, also the vim tutor helped a lto
01:40  Benkinooby: lot
01:42  bairui: Benkinooby: the old parable about giving fish vs teaching how to fish applies here. Usually, the best answers you'll get here *are* a :help reference. Fear not the beast! Embrace :help!    :)
01:42  Benkinooby: amen
01:42  bairui: meh... are a    good one, bazz...
01:43  bairui: and I wasn't aiming for religious overtones there... but I *have* noticed that my writings tend toward that direction, which is completely mind-boggling, given, well, everything.
01:44  bairui: perhaps it was all the irreverent Monty Python, Dave Allen and Rowen Atkinson I grew up on. :D
01:44  Benkinooby: hahaha
01:44 * bairui wonders how many oldies are in the room to spot the DA ref ;)
01:45  Benkinooby: DA?
01:45  bairui: Dave Allan
01:45  Benkinooby: ah
01:45  bairui: Allen    meh
