00:04  bairui: ReinH: :help ctrl-w_}
00:31  agib: how can I wrap text in a selection (to, say, a column width of 78)?
00:32  jamessan: assuming you've already ":set textwidth=78", then just gq
00:33  agib: jamessan: ah thank you!
00:33  agib: is there a default textwidth?
00:33  jamessan: :help 'textwidth
00:35  estragib: is there a way to make vim beep in a mapping?
00:35  agib: jamessan: can you explain what the g and q are in gq?
00:36  estragib: i mean besides producing an error obv :)
00:36  jamessan: agib: they're the two characters you press to run the gq command
00:36  agib: ...
00:36  jamessan: :help gq
00:37  ReinH: bairui: ah, thanks
00:37  bairui: np
00:37  agib: jamessan: thank you
00:37  jure_: can I disable recording?
00:38  bairui: estragib: :help :echoe
00:39  bairui: jure_: disable recording? Do you mean stop recording a macro? If so:   q
00:39  jure_: bairui: no, disable it, as in, prevent q+<some other char> from being registered as keystrokes to start recording
00:40  estragib: bairui: found the hidden treasure. thanks!
00:40  bairui: jure_: you could map over it, I guess...    :map q <Nop>
00:40  bairui: estragib: np
00:45  bairui: estragib: btw, I don't point people at the help pages to be terse and vague. I do it to show people that *everything* you need to know about vim is in there... somewhere. :)  I use   :helpgrep   to look for elusive needles in that haystack. :)
00:47  estragib: bairui: i actually wondered if you knew that little bit by heart or did a helpgrep, so i did i helpgrep and lo did i feel stupid to find it was the first hit for 'beep'
00:47  bairui: :)
00:49  bairui: I am a bear of very little brain; Using :help and :helpgrep trumps memorising.
00:49  fow: The help pages tend to also have more information than I am ever willing to type
00:49  bairui: agreed
00:50  bairui: and usually says it better too - once you understand vimgol
00:50  fow: yeah
00:52  Raimondi: Good morning, bairui :)
00:56  bairui: g'day, Raimondi :)
00:58 --- k23z__ is now known as spetrea-home
01:14  acidjazz: ok i got a sweet question .. if this is possible thatd be rad
01:15  bairui: sweetness is in the mouth of the beholder
01:15  acidjazz: in vim when i do a regex replace w/ variables like \1 .. is there a way i can add an increment to each match and replace?
01:15  acidjazz: like if i have c1 c1 c1 c1 c1 c1
01:15  acidjazz: i want to make c1 c2 c3 c4 c5
01:15  acidjazz: that possible? and if so how do i do it?
01:17  bairui: we get this question often... and yeah, Vim can do it. Takes a bit of   \=   magic.
01:24  bairui: acidjazz: most people consider this overkill, but I keep it around for just this purpose: http://vim.pastey.net/142521
02:36  semifor: Occasionally, I somehow lose a large amount of text in an editing session, seemingly unrecoverably.  On this tiny laptop keyboard, I think A accidenally mash the left ctrl key while typing and BAM, the last few minutes of work is gone.
02:36  semifor: Not sure what keys I'm hitting.
02:36  semifor: Can't find the missing text in :display
02:36  semifor: Is there a way to see the last several keysrokes?
02:50  joeytwiddle: semifor: if you accidentally hit 99u then you will want to hit 99<Ctrl+r> to redo
02:50  joeytwiddle: but be sure to check your CapsLock key before you do!
03:01  semifor: Hmm. Apparently, I'm not loosing text... I'm pasting in a big block of old text and moving the cursor which makes it look like lost text.  But the action can't be undone.  Wierd.
03:01  semifor: I think I'll start operating in record mode so I can see what keystrokes I'm actually hitting to get this effect.
03:18  Judson: Any idea why you can't map Ctrl-; ?
03:18  Judson: Been thinking it would be rad to :imap Ctrl-; Esc:
03:18  Judson: But Ctrl-; just inserts ;
03:20  jamessan: C-[ is the same as escape. just use that
03:21  kd5cga: hello. I'm new to linux and new to vim. I'm using Mint Linux (similar to Ubuntu). I want to install the snipMate plugin. I've downloaded the zip file. Instructions say to "unzip snipMate.zip -d ~/.vim" I don't see a .vim folder anywhere. I do see /usr/share/vim/addons that matches the contents/structure of the zip file, but am not allowed to extract there. Am I doing this wrong?

04:40  sir_lewk: is there a way to resolve the whole "found a swap file by the name..." thing with vimdiff?
04:45  jamessan: sir_lewk: :help :DiffOrig
04:46  jamessan: sir_lewk: so, just recover the file and then use that to compare against the on-disk file
04:46  sir_lewk: perfect, thanks :D

06:47  momentum_: what's a program for showing all vim files/buffers that are currently open?
06:51  Raimondi_: momentum: the command is   :ls
06:51 --- Raimondi_ is now known as Raimondi
06:56  gkatsev: mgedmin: :h :buffers
06:59  Raging_Hog: gkatsev: I think you wanted to point that at momentum
07:01  momentum: it's minibufexplorer plugin :-)
07:04  momentum: how do I tell vim to load a plugin?
07:05  Raimondi: :source /path/to/plugin
07:05  momentum: /usr/share/vim-scripts/plugin/minibufexpl.vim in particular
07:05  momentum: source just reads + executes the *.vim file
07:05  momentum: ther isn't somethihg like load
07:05  momentum: or require?
07:06  Raimondi: Â¿?
07:07  momentum: hmm, can I get something like minibufexpl
07:07  momentum: but vertical rather than horizontal
07:08  momentum: for showing the open buffers?
