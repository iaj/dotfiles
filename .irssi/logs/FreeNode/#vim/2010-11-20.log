13:50  peth: bosie: hm, works without problems here.
13:50 --- Channel #vim was synced in 70 seconds
13:51  peth: bosie: which one did you try?
13:51  bosie: should both @+>> and @+>
13:51  bosie: and @a
13:52  bosie: but i am wrong
13:52  bosie: it seems that :reg doesn't get updated
13:52  bosie: because "ap actually works
13:54  peth: oh, maybe that's something to do with :reg outputting something itself
13:57  bosie: thanks peth, combination of redir and q: seems to be exactly what i was looking for
14:16  Nuz: why does vim sometime open's new tab upon receiving error's from make ?
14:18  chandru_in: Is that a way to paste text from system clipboard to vim without spoiling indentation?  autoindent is on
14:21  _rane: doesn't "+p work?
14:24  jza: hi anyone ever configured vim with cvs/svn, I am reading the plugin to do this, but I cant wrap my head around how to configure it.
14:25  jza: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90
14:25  jza: the script docs mentioned the commands and how to install it but I can't see how to pass it through ssh connectivity
14:28  peth: chandru_in: vim or gvim? trying to paste with the mouse?
14:28  chandru_in: vim.  I'm using gnome terminal's paste shortcut.  but it ruins the indentation
14:32  peth: chandru_in: either use _rane's "+p or ":set paste" before
14:33  peth: what happens is gnome-terminal sends your clipboard contents to vim just as if you entered it yourself so vim tries to autoindent the text
14:34  peth: if vim knows you're pasting by using an explicit "+p paste command, or if you tell it by :set paste, it won't do it
14:36  chandru_in: :paste does the job
14:36  chandru_in: thanks a lot peth
14:37  peth: don't forget to :set nopaste after, it mucks a few things up. see :h 'paste'
14:37  chandru_in: ok
14:40  _rane: hmm
14:40  _rane: wouldn't it be possible to create a vim mapping for gnome's terminal paste shorcut to do "+p?
14:41  peth: gnome-terminal would intercept it before vim ever sees it, i think
14:41  _rane: maybe a better option would then to map C-v to paste, and get used to it
14:42  _rane: didn't read on :set paste's downsides, thoug
15:11  sas1234: hi
15:12  sas1234: i want to scroll the file but freeze the first 2 line i.e. i should see them always even if I move down
15:12  sas1234: how do I do it
15:13  Raimondi: :split
15:13  sas1234: Raimondi: ???
15:13  _rane: split window
15:13  Raimondi: sas1234: Use the :sp command  :h :split
15:14  sas1234: ohhhh
15:14  Raimondi: vimgor buffers
15:14  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
15:14  Raimondi: sas1234: ^
15:15  sas1234: i knew split but didn't think it could be used here
15:16  sas1234: thanks a lot
15:16  Raimondi: np :)
15:18  sas1234: i have a   file with 3 columns i want to paste 1st col. after 3rd, how do i do it
15:19  mhi^: sas1234: show an example?
15:21  sas1234: phone:name:lastname
15:22  sas1234: i can maybe use s/// to do it
15:22  sas1234: with backreferences
15:22  sas1234: is that the only way?
15:23  Raimondi: An alternative is blockwise visual mode
15:23  jamessan: it's the easiest way.  :%s/\([^:]\+\):\([^:]\+\):\([^:]\+\)/\3:\2:\1/
15:23  peth: you could also do a macro, or, your columns are padded with spaces, use visual block mode
15:23  _rane: :D
15:23  sas1234: Raimondi: i have : delimited
15:23  Raimondi: But, its's... what jamessan said ^  :)
15:23  mhi^: sas1234: Block select (ctrl+v), use 'd' to cut, then again block select with 'p' to paste
15:24  mhi^: of course that only works with fixed length columns, that's why I asked for a proper example
15:24  sas1234: mhi^: they are not fixed length at all
15:24  mhi^: cool
15:25  sas1234: can't i use an external cmd like awk and get it done w/o leaving vi
15:26  mhi^: Of course you can, but it won't be easier than that what jamessan said.
15:26  sas1234: yes i guess so
15:27  sas1234: thanks i will go with jamessan soln
15:27  Raimondi: sas1234: :h filter
15:27  sas1234: hmm ok will do it now
15:32  sas1234: brb
15:35  Keba: hi there
15:37  Keba: in #latex so. said vim-latexsuite is deprecated, and i should use sth else? what vim addon should i choose for developing latex in vim?
15:38  Kuukunen: latexsuite? sounds kinky
15:39  peth: :D
15:39  peth: vimgor: latex-suite
15:39  vimgor: An slightly-maintained, buggy, over-complicated plugin intended to make it easier to author (La)Tex files. Often, this is better served by using a standalone snippets plugin (like snipMate) to define the snippets you actually find useful as well as using the command ':compiler tex' to allow using Vim's quickfix feature when compiling TeX to an output format.
15:39  mhi^: Keba: use a snippet plugin (eg. snipmate) and define your own latex rules
15:43  Keba: hmm, ok
15:58  sas1234: Keba: ot but i like texmaker
16:21  Keba: re
16:21  Keba: sas1234: texmaker?
16:22  sas1234: Keba: yes
16:22  sas1234: it is not related with vim
16:32  ofauchon: Hi.. How can I search & replace with a previously cut line (yy) ? thx
16:39  zenom: Is there a way to show a line or something at around 80 characters?
16:40  Raimondi: zenom: :h 'cc'
16:40  Raimondi: zenom: That's for 7.3
16:41  zenom: thanks
16:47  peth: ofauchon: not sure what you mean, but Ctrl-R, then " on the cmdline will insert your last yank/delete
16:49  complete: Hey Vim Heroes! How do I select everything to the next occurence of "]"?
16:50  complete: I tried :V/] but that wasnt it :)
16:50  Raimondi: Try  V/]
16:51  Raimondi: Well  V/]<CR>
16:51  complete: You guys are damn awesome!
16:51  Raimondi: Well, it's all Vim's awesomeness :)
16:53  complete: would be fun to write something as high quality as vim but in a different area. and make tons of money with it.
16:55  peth: if it's as hq as vim, you won't be making any money with it :p
16:55  complete: peth: why?
16:56  peth: because it seems people prefer mediocre quality to high quality. it's the one-button solutions that are making money.
16:57  complete: i dont believe that. see how popular vim is.
16:57  complete: and photoshop.
16:57  complete: and linux. apache. mysql.
16:57  complete: i dont think quality hurts a product.
16:58  peth: neither do i, i think it hurts its appeal to the "masses". maybe i'm a tad too cynic here.
16:58  ofauchon: peth,  I' like to copy a text part with v (visual mode) and y to copy. When I'ts copied, I want to search and replace with the text part  :%s/mypattern/BUFFER/g
16:59  peth: ofauchon: the easy way would be to :%s/pattern/^R"/g then
16:59  ofauchon: ^R" means 'what's in the buffer'  ?

17:32  ablmf: Does vim 7.3 still works with Python 2.x ?
17:33  ablmf: I want to update but I need to keep Python 2.x on my machine.
17:33  ablmf: And I have some script for vim written in Python
17:34  peth: ablmf: 7.3 has both python 2 and 3 support, afaik
17:34  ablmf: peth: OK, thanks!
18:00  xixor: Can anyone recommend how to get Exuberant_ctags installed on mac os x?
18:00  xixor: it comes with a ctags command, is that good enough?
18:01  deryni: What does 'ctags --version' say?
18:02  xixor: both --version and -version are illegal, lets check the man pages
18:02  deryni: --help?
18:02  xixor: nope
18:03  xixor: no version, no help, man page is quite terse, only says that ctags was included in version 3.0 of bsd
18:17  Buck: how can I insert a bytecode in vim instead of a ascii character?
18:20  kongo: Buck: maybe you want to look at :h i_ctrl-v
18:21  Buck: thank you kongo
18:25  xixor: Does this look alright?
18:25  xixor: map <C-F12> :!/opt/local/bin/ctags -R --sort=yes --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .<CR>
18:26  xixor: When I run the command from the command line, or paste it manually into vim and run with :! it seems to work
18:26  xixor: when I try to invoke it with Cntrl+F12, my mac beeps and the command doesn't seem to run
18:28  godlygeek: a) you should probably be using :nnoremap, not :map, and b) my guess is that your mac doesn't send something for <C-F12> that vim recognizes.
18:28  godlygeek: are you in terminal vim or gui?
18:28  xixor: terminal vim
18:28  xixor: I will try to see if Cntrl+F12 is bound somewhere
18:29  Craig`: apparently i dont have a .vimrc file
18:29  godlygeek: no, i mean that it's likely that your terminal emulator and vim don't agree on what C-F12 means
18:29  godlygeek: Craig`: ok...  create one?  :)
18:29  Craig`: aha good idea
18:32  Craig`: im using programmers dvorak, how should i setup vim commands, id like an alternative for hjkl for dvorak
18:32  godlygeek: xixor: try using a keystroke other that <C-F12> - just regular <F12> might work, and if not you could always use <leader> (ie, :map <Leader>tag .....)
18:33  godlygeek: Craig`: i wouldn't do that, your question is misguided; it assumes that hjkl are common navigation keys in vim, and they are not.
18:33  Craig`: oh i thought they were
18:33  xixor: is A-F12 for alt+F12?
18:33  Craig`: im totally new to vim and wanting to use it to its potential
18:34  Craig`: use it effectively that is
18:34  Nuz: why does vim sometimes when I run make, open a new tab/buffer ?
18:35  xixor: hm.... still can't get code completion to come up
18:37  godlygeek: xixor: alt is even less likely to work than ctrl is
18:38  godlygeek: vimgor: movement
18:38  xixor: yeah, that didn't work
18:38  vimgor: In normal mode, all of these keys can move the cursor: ` # $ % ^ * ( ) 0 _ - + w W e E t T I o O { } [[ [] ][ ]] [m [M ]m ]M [( ]) [{ ]} | A f F ge gE gg G g0 g^ g$ g, g; gj gk gI h H j k l L ; ' z. z<CR> z- zz zt zb b B n N M , / ? <C-b> <C-d> <C-e> <C-f> <C-h> <C-i> <C-o> <C-t> <C-u> <C-y> - learn to use all of them
18:38  godlygeek: Craig`: ^
18:38  Craig`: all of them? heh
18:38  godlygeek: Nuz: because the first error was in a file that hadn't been opened yet, and 'switchbuf' included either split or newtab
18:39  Craig`: whats the best tutorial to learn their uses
18:40  godlygeek: xixor: vim's terminal key handling isn't great, and terminal.app isn't the greatest terminal emulator...  it's tough to find overlap where they agree on what a "special" key should send.  really, in your place i'd just go with a <leader> map
18:40  xixor: yeah
18:40  godlygeek: Craig`: the vim help is fantastic.  :help `  :help #  :h %  :h ^   etc
18:41  Craig`: cheers
18:41  et: xixor: out of curiosity, why aren't you using macvim?
18:41  godlygeek: Craig`: the most useful ones:  * # / ? w W b B f F t T , ; 0 $
18:41  xixor: I just want to use it in the terminal for now
18:41  et: why?
18:41  Craig`: thanks godlygeek ill try and learn them
18:42  godlygeek: et: gnu screen, ssh.  :)
18:42  Nuz: godlygeek: hmm.. how can I avoid this ? I had the problematic file opened in a split
18:42  xixor: yo, so I am following: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/C%2B%2B_code_completion   how do I tell if I have the omnicppcomplete .vim files in the right dirctory?  I have the tags files built, but the code completion never pops up
18:43  xixor: just trying to debug it now
18:43  Craig`: i guess i should really program something to learn them.. what to program, heh
18:44  et: godlygeek: i've seldom seen people on a mac use them
18:44  godlygeek: Nuz: :help 'switchbuf'  - you probably wanted 'useopen' in there...
18:44  godlygeek: xixor: does it show up in the output of :scriptnames ?
18:45  xixor: godlygeek: the output of :scriptnames is confusing... it shows 1 to 19 scripts, and it isn't there
18:45  godlygeek: it's not confusing - it's just the list of all scripts that have been loaded since vim started.  if omnicppcomplete isn't there, it hasn't been loaded.
18:45  godlygeek: so.... where *did* you place the files?
18:46  xixor: ~/.vim/vimfiles/
18:46  Nuz: godlygeek: thanks, I'll look into this, at least I know where the problem is now
18:46  godlygeek: xixor: definitely not right.  :)d
18:47  xixor: ah, I was reading the windows instructions It hink
18:47  godlygeek: you want to just "cd ~/.vim" and then unzip the zip from there.
18:47  xixor: ah, there we go, thanks :!
18:48  xixor: working, that is great
18:49  xixor: one more question, then I'll shut up, how do you open a file and make it the active window?  currently I open files with :badd
18:49  godlygeek: :e /path/to/file
18:50  godlygeek: or, if you want to open it in a new window, :split /path/to/file
18:50  xixor: ah, I thought :e was only to make an empty buffer
18:53  godlygeek: only if you give it no arguments.  :new is to open a new buffer in a split.
18:53  xixor: great, well thanks for the help
18:53  godlygeek: and there's also :tabe and :tabnew for starting a new tab...
18:53  xixor: I haven't got to tabs yet
18:53  zenom: how do I map an extension like .jst to html file types? or erb filetypes?
18:53  xixor: I can barely  move around with buffers and windows right now
18:54  srk9: I just discovered tab pages in vim. I would like to move back and forth between them similarly to how I move back and forth in irssi, but unfortunately, Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown are reserved by Konsole. Is there any way I can change the key bindings so that I can navigate them more easily?
19:00  Craig`: whats the best way to work on multiple files at once?
19:00  Craig`: different tabs as such
19:00  Craig`: for my html, css and js
19:00  Keba: srk9: you could change the Konsole settings? (if you don’t need them)
19:00  Keba: maybe using vim in one Konsole tab also works
19:00  Raimondi: Craig`: Are you familiar with the concept of buffers and windows in Vim?
19:01  Craig`: i could do that, id like to see all the files at once, either horizontally or vertically
19:01  Raimondi: vimgor: buffers
19:01  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
19:01  Craig`: Raimondi, im afraid not im new to vim
19:01  Raimondi: Craig`: Check that ^
19:01  Raimondi: Note the help references at the end
19:02  srk9: Keba: I would prefer to change the vim settings. I cannot find how to do it in Konsole and I am somewhat accustomed to having that change things in konsole.
19:03  Craig`: thanks, is it possible to view all tabs at once?
19:03  Raimondi: srk9: Do you know about mappings?
19:03  srk9: Raimondi: Not in vim.
19:04  srk9: Raimondi: How do I set them? I would ideally like to be able to move around in vim like I move in irssi.
19:04  Raimondi: srk9: :h o.5.3
19:04  Raimondi: srk9: Sorry   :h 0.5.3
19:05  srk9: Raimondi: It says that there is no help for that.
19:06  Raimondi: srk9: Sorry again, I'm in dumb mode   :h 05.3
19:07  Raimondi: Craig`: What do you mean by that?
19:07  Craig`: i can see all open files in one window
19:08  godlygeek: that's what splits are for.  if you want that, just don't use tabs...
19:08  deryni: To see more than one file at the same time you need windows not tabs.
19:09  Craig`: godlygeek, well im wanting splits then
19:09  godlygeek: i know a lot of the regulars here (it's not just me!) have said that they use tabs only very rarely - multiple split windows are more useful, imho.
19:09  Craig`: yeah splits are what im wanting
19:10  godlygeek: :help windows
19:11  srk9: Raimondi: I want to map whatever it is that Ctrl+PgUp and Ctrl+PgDn control to Alt+ArrowLeft and Alt+ArrowRight. The documentation in 05.3 does not seem to help with that. It appears to be for macros.
19:12  Raimondi: :noremap <A-Left> <C-Up>
19:13  godlygeek: srk9: :nnoremap <A-Right> <C-PageDown>
19:13  godlygeek: Raimondi: you meant PageUp, not Up  :)
19:13  Raimondi: You're right there, godlygeek :)
19:14  Raimondi: I shouldn't be answering questions today :)
19:16  srk9: godlygeek: Thanks. Unfortunately, it seems like alt is being intercepted somewhere onthe way to vim. :/
19:17  xixor: so what other vim goodies are there to look at for the newb/
19:17  xixor: ?
19:18  Raimondi: xixor: What do you need to do?
19:18  xixor: use vim better
19:18  xixor: program in C/C++, write latex
19:18  xixor: be more efficient in the terminal particularly
19:18  Raimondi: Do you know about text objects?
19:18  xixor: not a clue about them
19:18  Raimondi: :h text-objects
19:20  xixor: How does the navigation in the help work?  I presume that the help is just a text file with some sort of html-like markup for documentation navigation?  Be handy to do be able to zip around using cntrl+[ in my own documents
19:20  Raimondi: The help uses tags  :h tags
19:22  mhi^: xixor: and for C: :h 'cindent'; use plugins like snipmate, taglist, nerdcommenter
19:22  mhi^: maybe cscope, if you're used to it
19:27  godlygeek: even if you're not used to it!  i can't use cscope from the "normal" cscope interface at all, but i love using it in vim.
19:28  mhi^: :D
