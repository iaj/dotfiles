00:34  jtaby_: any idea how to map Ctrl+arrow keys to :bn<cr> and :bp<cr> ?
00:34  jtaby_: I've been it done before, just not sure how to refer to the arrow keys in my mappings
00:35  fow: <C-left> for example. may not work in terminal Vim
00:58  rudi_s: jtaby_: Better not use the arrow keys, they are too far away. I can recommend gb and gB for :bn and :bp
01:01  jtaby_: rudi_s: interesting, i'll try that, thanks
01:01  rudi_s: np
01:05  |dgs|: when im writing comments vim (seemingly sporadically) indents my comments to 3 chars, instead of the default of 2 chars which it uses normally
01:05  |dgs|: i cant work out why - eg, if i move down to the next function (ruby) and add a line to the comment, it indents to 2 chars like it normally would
01:06  |dgs|: oh, typically, 3 seconds after I ask the question, i work out the answer
01:06  |dgs|: gah
01:07  |dgs|: the previous function last 'end' was indented to 3 chars
01:12  mcantor: Is there a way to change syntax highlighting in the middle of a file?  Like, "for the duration of this heredoc, use XML" in the middle of a Python file?
01:12  jeffszusz: yes mcantor
01:12  jeffszusz: :set filetype=xml
01:13  jeffszusz: but
01:13  mcantor: jeffszusz: Then I lose the Python syntax highlighing.
01:13  jeffszusz: all behavior will switch
01:13  mcantor: Right... sorry, what I'm trying to ask is, can I change syntax highlighting for *only* a chunk of a file?
01:13  jeffszusz: you can switch back and forth all you want
01:15  jeffszusz: that i don't know.
01:15  jeffszusz: but
01:15  jeffszusz: i just :set filetype=python
01:15  jeffszusz: then work on the pyhon
01:15  jeffszusz: then switch it when i want to work on the other.
01:15  jeffszusz: let me try something.
01:18  jeffszusz: nope does'nt work. I tried to edit the file in a split and then change the filetype of one of the windows
01:18  jeffszusz: changed both.
01:18  _Ludwig_: Where could I find a list of things new to 7.3 in comparison to 7.2? Like a complete list. I've been wondering a little on vim.org, but had no luck.
01:18  jeffszusz: not sure what you could do.
01:18  jeffszusz: mcantor: you might consider mapping a function key to toggle between Python and XML for you
01:19  mcantor: jeffszusz: Eh, yeah, but that's so boring... ;-)
01:19  jeffszusz: lol
01:19  jeffszusz: the only thing i can think of
01:20  Spidey01: _Ludwig_: :help version-7.3
01:20  jeffszusz: is to open up the python.vim and xml.vim syntax files and manually merge them into a python/xml hybrid syntax file.
01:21  jeffszusz: basically copy/paste and then look for places where they conflict.
01:22  qubit: does such a plugin exist that would allow you to save marks for specific lines? what i mean is that you could have a mark on line X that you could only use if your cursor was on line Y. usage would be in a program where if you created something, and later wanted to jump to where it was cleaned up
01:23  Spidey01: qubit: no, but I believe you can save marks in viminfo or sth
01:25  qubit: Spidey01: ya, but i'd need it to be on specific lines, i would never remember that the cleanup for some var was under mark X
01:25  jeffszusz: qubit
01:25  estragib: qubit: add an end of line comment with a unique id and use * ?
01:25  jeffszusz: try the "TaskList" plugin. has nothing to do with marks but you can put a comment in your code that says
01:25  jeffszusz: # TODO
01:25  jeffszusz: or FIXME
01:25  Spidey01: When I use a mark, it's usually a temporary mark that's mnemonic to what's at the other end
01:25  jeffszusz: or XXX
01:25  jeffszusz: then :TaskList shows you all the places with those marks.
01:25  Spidey01: Allows me to semi-intuitively guess without having to look at a list of marks
01:26  qubit: TaskList would be to messy. I could probably just get away with estragib's suggestion
01:27  jeffszusz: why is #FIXME messy?
01:28  qubit: jeffszusz: because i want to quickly jump to the corresponding line from where i'm at. with what it sounds like TaskList does, I'd have to search through all the FIXME/TODO tags
01:28  _Ludwig_: Spidey01, grateful !
01:29  jeffszusz: :TaskList gives you a short list of all the fixme's together, the todo's together, and the XXX's together. when you're on one, it auto-jumps to that line in your main window.
01:29  qubit: well, i'll look at it, but it doesnt sound like a good solution. could be wrong though
01:30  jeffszusz: i'm curious as to why you'd always want to jump to that one line
01:30  qubit: Say in C I do a malloc(), i want to find all the places where i do a free() for that var
01:31  qubit: (just one simple example of many uses)
01:32  jeffszusz: oh i see
01:34  Spidey01: qubit: doing that, IMHO is the job of a static code analysis tool, not a text editor
01:35  qubit: i dont want it for code analysis though, just a easy way to navigate around my program
01:36  Spidey01: qubit: and what should happen if you haven't added a free(<some exact var that you can't handle scope without understanding the syntax because :/is to general>, automatically write free(var) right there? :-)
01:37  Spidey01: With all the code completion crap in VS, I can't help but wonder, if anyone has tried to make the thing detect memory leaks as you code lol
01:38  qubit: Spidey01: no, but when I'm going around making changes to the code, chances are if I make a change related to the variable when its created, I'll probably need to make a change to when its cleaned up as well
01:39  qubit: or maybe I want to mark all the functions that use/modify the variable and easily jump between them all
01:39  Spidey01: Suddenly that makes me pine for automatic destructor invocation :'(
01:39 * jeffszusz snickers and dances the "I'm glad my language of choice does automatic garbage collection" dance.
01:40  Spidey01: Actually, I don't mind manual memory management in the least :-/
01:41  jeffszusz: do you actually have to change something at the death of a variable if you change something at it's birth?
01:41  Spidey01: I just wish there was some huge ass utility library for C and C++, that could match things like the Python, Java, and .NET standard batteries
01:42  jeffszusz: there's not a big C library?
01:42  jeffszusz: I assumed there was.
01:42  qubit: jeffszusz: usually one does final processing on the variable right before you destroy it
01:42  Spidey01: Well, POSIX and the Windows API are fairly big. But not what I had in mind.
01:43  Spidey01: POSIX is more of a standard than a library though
01:43  Spidey01: When working in GC'd languages, I generally find there are 2 reasons that I become more productive
01:44  dborba: Spidey01, POSIX is not a library...
01:44  qubit: dborba: in perl it is :-P
01:44  Spidey01: A.) I have more libraries readily available; B.) Language features that help (e.g. closures)
01:45  Spidey01: haha, someone just had to say that qubit
01:45  dborba: qubit, the perl posix library is a posix implementation :P
01:46  Spidey01: In practice, most of POSIX is either implemented as system calls or stuffed in the C standard library
01:46  Spidey01: If I ever write my own toy OS, you can bet libposix and libwin32 will not be part of libc ^_^
01:46 * Spidey01 ducks out for BLTs
02:05  rson: docs say if i set undodir and have +persistent_undo then persistent undo should automatically kick in.  anyone know any more info on this? doesn't seem to be working for me.
02:07  _Ludwig_: What exactly does Pathogen plugin do? I'm reading a text on some of the new (usual) plugins, and I'm not understanding this one. http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332
02:07 * Spidey01 belches
02:08  fow: _Ludwig_, it lets you separate your plugins into separate directories to make installing/uninstalling them easier. you may also want to look at Vim Addon Manager
02:08  Spidey01: _Ludwig_: think of it as what Pythons os.path is for paths, in vim for opt=a,b,c
02:08  Spidey01: At least, that's what it looks like at first glance to me...
02:08  rson: _Ludwig_: compartmentalizes plugins so you don't have their files scattered throughout the .vim folder
02:09  rson: i had been doing that for a long time manually, but it also adds a few things that make it a bit better than manually handling it, like generating the helptags for you
02:09  _Ludwig_: Spidey01 :: Okey, so if so far I had a configuration like this. _vimrc, vimfiles directory (and all its subs), and vim directory (and all its subs) how does it change that?
02:09  Spidey01: Hmm, this looks much nicer than relying on rakefiles
02:11  Spidey01: _Ludwig_: the only plugin I'm consistently (ab)using is the NERD tree really
02:11  rson: _Ludwig_: it's better to just show an example... http://github.com/rson/dotfiles/tree/master/vim/
02:11  rson: _Ludwig_: see how each plugin has it's own directory and is self contained?  it makes it much easier to add and remove plugins
02:13  rson: btw, re: my undo problem, i read the docs wrong. you need to set undofile not undodir
02:14  _Ludwig_: rson :: A-ah, I see. (Interestingly, I didn't know vim recognizes the name "plugin-git" instead of "plugins"). Yes, so what it does is simply separates plugins in plugins directory into separate (all in one directory) "containers"? What about plugins that are separated in several directories (like ftpplugin, plugin, help ... etc.) ?
02:15  rson: _Ludwig_: vim doesn't recognize plugin-git, that's what i chose to name the direcotry where i drop all the plugins.
02:16  rson: the entire directory structure that a plugin needs is in the ~/.vim/plugin-git/pluginname/ directory
02:16  rson: brb, food
02:16  _Ludwig_: rson :: ok.
02:16  Spidey01: _Ludwig_: vim doesn't recognize much of anything, so much as it uses rtp
02:17  _Ludwig_: rson :: so, if i drop all the files into pluginname/ it should work? (i always thought for example, help files should be in help and so on)
02:19  dsdeiz: hm, how to have the vimrc be read under .vim?
02:19  Spidey01: dsdeiz: several ways
02:19 * Spidey01 begins to play with pathogen
02:19  spiiph: dsdeiz, use a soft link
02:20  dsdeiz: ahh gotcha
02:20  Spidey01: spiiph: what if the OS doesn't support such a thing?
02:20  spiiph: Get a better OS :)
02:20  Spidey01: :-)
02:20 --- sora_h is now known as sorah_off
02:21  spiiph: Shouldn't be a big problem. All UNIX derivatives support it, as far as I know, and so does Vista/Win7
02:21  spiiph: If you're on XP, well, tough luck.
02:21  mfwitten: When searching with a regular expresion, one may use \1 to match again what group 1 has ALREADY matched. However, is there a way to reuse the regular expression (the atom?) given by group 1 rather than the text that has been matched?
02:22  Spidey01: spiiph: you can do it on XP
02:22  mcantor: mfwitten: I'm not really sure what you mean.  Can you give an example?
02:22  spiiph: Spidey01, really? I thought the NTFS version on XP didn't support it?
02:22  Spidey01: spiiph: it's also possible to use a stub .vimrc that sources ~/.vim/vimrc; or diddle some environment stuff
02:22  spiiph: Sure
02:23  Spidey01: spiiph: you have to use NTFS junctions in XP
02:23  Spidey01: More or less closer to a hard link, or in between a hard link and symbolic link, in beloved unix parlance
02:24  mfwitten: mcantor: `\(.oo\)\1' matches `foofoo' but not `foogoo' because `\1' matches what group 1 has ALREADY matched, name `foo'. However, I'd like to be able to reference group 1' regular expression rather than what group 1 has matched.
02:24  spiiph: Spidey01, yeah, that's what you have to use in Vista and Win7 as well, but I thought they didn't exist on XP.
02:24  mfwitten: (name `foo' == namely `foo')
02:24  Spidey01: spiiph: *shrugs*
02:25  Spidey01: as far as I know, Vista added symbolic links but XP (and possible 2K) already supported junctions
02:25  mfwitten: mcantor: Does that make sense?
02:26  Spidey01: You can use something like Winbolic or mkWhateverItsCalled to manage junctions on XP
02:28  mcantor: mfwitten: Why not just do \(.oo\)\{2,2\} ?
02:28  Spidey01: There is usually a way around Windows, if you are willing to give yourself a sufficient mad on to find it
02:28  mfwitten: mcantor: Because the expression I want to make isn't as simple as the example
02:28  mfwitten: mcantor: Also, you could simplify what you have just written further: \(.oo\)\{2\}
02:29  mcantor: mfwitten: But \{} will repeat the entire atom, just like \1 would.
02:29  _Ludwig_:  Am I mistaken or does Pathogen installs everything in VIM directory (not vimfiles) ?
02:29  mfwitten: I don't want to repeat it right next to each other
02:29  mcantor: Ahhh.
02:29  spiiph: _Ludwig_, you shouldn't install anything in the $VIM directory
02:30  spiiph: Use ~/.vim or ~\vimfiles
02:30  fow: _Ludwig_, pathogen doesn't install anything anywhere. you install the plugins in some directory, and Pathogen makes it easier to manage them
02:30  mfwitten: Basically, I want a goddam name for a portion of the regular expression so that I don't have to repeat myself.
02:30  mfwitten: Isn't that an obvious feature?
02:30  mcantor: mfwitten: PCRE includes the concept of "named subpatterns".  Dunno if vim supports it.
02:30  _Ludwig_: spiiph :: so "the correct way" would be to install pathogen in vimfiles first, and let it handle the rest from there, no?
02:31  mfwitten: mcantor: Yeah, but I think that has the same problem; you only get access to what has been matched----not to the regular expression itself.
02:31  spiiph: Well, as fow said, pathogen won't install anything. It just makes managing installed plugins easier
02:32  _Ludwig_: fow :: (sorry spiiph) so "the correct way" would be to install pathogen in vimfiles first, and let it handle the rest from there, no? i know these sound rather simpleton questions, but it's been a while since i've made any changes to my configuration. now the new 7.3 is out, thought i might remedy that.
02:32  fow: _Ludwig_, it might help to better understand what it means to "install" a plugin in Vim. Really all you do is create a certain structure in some folder, and then you add that folder to 'rtp'. Pathogen makes the second part really easy
02:33  mcantor: mfwitten: Sorry man, I am out of ideas!
02:33  mfwitten: mcantor: That's OK. Thanks for entertaining my question.
02:33  mcantor: no prob.
02:33  _Ludwig_: fow :: okey, thanks. I'll try it, and see what i'll get.
02:34  fow: _Ludwig_, personally as I mentioned earlier, I prefer vim-addon-manager, for whatever that's worth
02:35  _Ludwig_: fow :: what's the difference?
02:36  fow: _Ludwig_, Pathogen makes it really easy to separate your plugins, but it still takes a sort of all-or-nothing approach where enabling certain plugins can be a bit of work but enabling all of them is really easy. VAM makes it really easy to selectively load plugins
02:36  fow: VAM can also update plugins and magically install plugins for you
02:37  fow: I suggest looking at them both and seeing which suits you more
02:39  _Ludwig_: fow :: well, i would prefer the one that separates plugins (presumably, both do that) but is easier to use. could you perhaps give an example, just to get me started, (on a clean vim install, well, unzip :) how to get started with VAM, and how to use it to install one example plugin?
02:41  fow: Well, Pathogen is pretty much something like mkdir ~/.vim/bundles ; *unpack plugins to separate directories within ~/.vim/bundles*; add call pathogen#Some_function_name_I_forgot('~/.vim/bundles') to vimrc
02:43  fow: VAM is mkdir ~/.vim/addons; unpack VAM to ~/.vim/addons; unpack plugins to separate directories in ~/.vim/addons ; add ~/.vim/addons/vim-addon-manager to rtp ; add call scriptmanager#Activate(['foo', 'bar', 'baz']) to vimrc ; :h :ActivateAddons
02:44  aaron01: I'm trying to use http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790, but it doesn't seem to be taking (string replacements are not being highlighted: 'this:%s should be highlighted' % foo). Suggestions on what to check? (syntax is on, and the script is in ~/.vim/syntax)
02:45  _Ludwig_: fow :: so, it makes easier to enable separate plugins, while when using pathogen (and by default) all of them get loaded. uhmm, i always kept all plugins loaded - what could be an example case when you want to load just some separate ones?
02:47  fow: _Ludwig_, say I use CSApprox to create colorscheme snapshots as I rarely have access to a terminal Vim with GUI support. For the most part, I'll be using the snapshot, which doesn't require CSApprox to be loaded, but from time to time I might need to recreate the snapshot, which does require CSApprox
02:49  fow: IMO that's not as useful as VAM's ability to update plugins
02:49  _Ludwig_: fow :: say i want to test out some plugins i won't be keeping (or i don't know whether i will or won't). can i use it to more easily instal it, and then uninstall it without it giving me headaches about it like vimball.
02:50  fow: yeah, exactly, though that should be easy with both Pathogen and VAM
02:51  Spidey01: VAM?
02:52  fow: vim-addon-manager

03:46  fritzophrenic: oooh, that sounds nice...with persistent undo support?

03:59  LiTuX: Hey guys, I don't know if Vim need an IM itself, but when using an Input Method in vim, especially under Linux, we have to change the IM status again and again. Any solution?
04:11  Maahes: I'm using ubuntu and just learning vim, it seems that the majority of the settings are in /usr/share/vim/vim72 I copied the vimrc_example.vim to /home/ubuntu/.vim/vimrc.vim is this correct? Because it's not recognizing the function that's built into the example rc (:DiffOrig)
04:12  deryni: No .vim/vimrc.vim is not correct. Also, I'm not sure you actually want to use the example vimrc as-is.
04:12  deryni: :help vimrc lists the correct location.

05:07  fritzophrenic: maguey_, :help gui-scrollbars might give you a hint
05:08  fritzophrenic: _Ludwig_, put in your .vimrc (very very early in it) set encoding=utf-8
05:08  fritzophrenic: possibly will also need to set fileencodings to a good value
05:10  maguey_: but as far as I know vim is not running in graphic mode. I just tried :set guioptions=mlrb
05:11  fritzophrenic: non-gui Vim doesn't have scrollbars at all, does it?
05:21  maguey_: So I guess is not possible correct?
05:28  fritzophrenic: you're trying to get GUI scroll bars in non-GUI Vim? Probably not possible. I don't know much about the differences between GUI and non-GUI though, I pretty much always use GUI

06:00  fritzophrenic: belak, get rid of smartindent, you're not supposed to use both
06:00  fritzophrenic: also smartindent isn't smart at all
06:00  fritzophrenic: you shouldn't use it at all
06:01  fritzophrenic: I wonder what vimgor says about that...
06:01  fritzophrenic: vimgor, smartindent
06:01  vimgor: Don't you mean stupidindent? In all seriousness, 'smartindent' is an obsolete option for C-like syntax. It has been replaced with 'cindent', and setting 'cindent' also overrides 'smartindent'. Vim has indentation support for many languages out-of-the-box, and setting 'smartindent' (or 'cindent', for that matter) in your .vimrc might interfere with this. Use 'filetype indent on' and be (1 more message)
06:02  belak: Thanks...
06:02  Maahes: remyo, I'm fairly certain zenburn isn't being loaded even when I tell vim to, so vim may not be referencing my .vim/colors directory. I'd like to be able to see what the current color scheme is
06:03  remyo: Maahes: And when you run :colors is says zenburn?
06:03  Maahes: :colors returns: argument required
06:05  remyo: Hm. Thats not normal. Even if it wasn't loading the colorscheme it would say "default"

06:07  remyo: Ah, :colors must be a 7.3 thing. I just tried :colors on anohter installation I have (7.1) and I get Argument required too
06:07  remyo: But it 7.3 it does echo the theme
06:12  remyo: Maahes: Check out the answer on this, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2419624/how-to-tell-which-colorscheme-a-vim-session-currently-uses
06:16  infid: sweet, i've wondered how to do that
06:18  Maahes: zenburn is not working, I had it loaded both in /usr/share/vim/vim72/colors and ~/.vim/colors =( doing :colorscheme zenburn just turns off coloring
06:19  remyo: Maahes: Are you adding :colorscheme zenburn to ~/.vimrc
06:20  remyo: Without the :
06:20  deryni: The : doesn't matter in a vimrc file.
06:20  deryni: Are you trying zenburn in console vim?
06:20  fritzophrenic: Maahes, upgrade to vim 7.3 and you can use :colors without args to show current colorscheme
06:20  Maahes: do I need to? I was under the impression I could set colorscheme in vim and it would write to the rc
06:20  Maahes: deryni, yes
06:20  deryni: vim doesn't write the vimrc file by default.
06:21  deryni: zenburn is a gui-only color scheme as far as I know.
06:21  fritzophrenic: use the cssapprox plugin and it will work in console mostly
06:21  fritzophrenic: vimgor, cssapprox
06:21  vimgor: No idea!
06:21  fritzophrenic: really? that's odd
06:21  fritzophrenic: vimgor, csapprox
06:21  vimgor: CSApprox is a plugin written by godlygeek to make GUI-only colorschemes Just Work in 88-/256-color terminals. It can be downloaded at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390
06:21  fritzophrenic: that's better
06:21  fritzophrenic: night, all!
06:21  remyo: Night
06:24  Maahes: vimgor, vimrc
06:24  vimgor: Try typing :help vimrc-intro and check out <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Open_vimrc_file>. Also try the #vim approved example vimrc at <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc>.
06:29  remyo: Thats kind of interesting. Just tried zenburn
06:35  tmr: zenburn is not gui only.
06:42  deryni: Hm. It would seem I just have an exceedingly old version where I checked that.
06:53  Tricia: Is there a quick way to turn off current search highlights? (I've been searching for random characters when I wanted to turn it off)
06:54  Jerub: :nohls
06:54  Jerub: bind a key to that if you want
06:54  tmr: vimgor, nohl
06:54  vimgor: :nohl will disable current search highlighting until the next search is performed. A common map to avoid typing :nohl is ':nnoremap <silent> <C-l> :nohl<CR><C-l>'. See also, :help 'incsearch' and :help 'hlsearch'
06:55  Tricia: oo. thanks.
07:25  Maahes: I'm baffled, I have zenburn installed and it looks different on vim, gvim, and cream
07:27  tmr: I haven't seen noticeable differences between xterm+vim/gvim
07:28  Maahes: it looks fantastic on cream, okay on gvim, and meh-ish on vim. in cream class Person > Human or whatever class is bold and a soft color and
07:29  Maahes: Person > Human would be bold and soft green
07:29  Maahes: gvim doesn't change the color of the class declaration but does bold them
07:30  Maahes: whilst in vim: class, def, end, etc. are in a harsh red color
07:31  tmr: Are you using 256 color terminal?
07:32  fow: Maahes, I don't know much about cream, but the difference is to be expected. Terminals support anywhere from 2 to 256 colors, while gvim supports something like 2^24 colors
07:32  fow: *the difference between vim and gvim
07:33  fow: (When I say anywhere, I mean 2, 8, 88, or 256 for the most part)
07:34  Maahes: is gnome-term a 256 color console?
07:39  tmr: Maahes, don't know but it likes to lie about being xterm and default xterm terminfo does not support 256 colors.
07:40  Maahes: thats useful knowledge
07:40  tmr: Maahes, you can probably find setting somewhere where you can tell it to send right TERM.
07:43  deryni: vimgor: gnome-terminal
07:43  vimgor: A terminal that falsely claims to be xterm and gives users no way to change that without recompiling. If you're trying to get Vim to display more colors in gnome-terminal, make sure you have a gnome-256color terminfo entry ('tput -Tgnome-256color colors' says 256) and use the following snippet in your shell init file: http://vim.pastey.net/116135
07:44  tmr: Ah, it's even worse than I thought..
07:45  tmr: Also, pastey is annoying as it doesn't support raw output..
07:46  deryni: Hm?

08:50  sgo11: hi, if I copy something in browser with ctrl+C, how to paste it to gvim? (under linux). thanks.
08:51  akosch: "+p in normal mode
08:52  sgo11:  akosch yeah, it works. thanks a lot. what about if I select some text with mouse for copy in linux?
08:52  the_isz: sgo11: i think that should be   "*p   then
08:53  the_isz: sgo11: or just use the middle mouse button
08:53  sgo11: the_isz, yeah, both are right. thanks. :)
08:53  akosch: "*p
08:53  sgo11: akosch, thanks. :)
08:53  akosch: np :)
08:53  the_isz: sgo11: you're welcome
08:55  Maahes: normal mode is command mode right?
08:55  the_isz: Maahes: no
08:55  Maahes: how do you switch to normal mode
08:55  the_isz: Maahes: command mode is what you get pressing :
08:55  Maahes: oh
08:55  the_isz: Maahes: you get to normal mode pressing <ESC>
08:57  Maahes: okay, +p and *p are not sending things from the mouse buffer or ctrl-c buffer for me
08:57  Raimondi: Maahes:  "+p
08:57  Maahes: oh "
08:57  Maahes: any input on my mapping and why it's not working?
08:57  the_isz: vimgor: doesn't work
08:57  vimgor: What happened? Did it fall asleep on your couch? Eat your homework? Destroy your hard drive? Be specific.
08:59  Maahes:  <C-J> <C-W>j<C-W>_ map <C-K> <C-W>k<C-W>_ isn't allowing me to switch between buffers by holding Ctrl, no behavior at all
08:59  Maahes: map before the <C-J> too
08:59  DHulme: Maahes: do you mean windows instead of buffers?
09:00  Maahes: er. yes, I presumed windows were also buffers
09:00  DHulme: vimgor: buffers
09:00  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548 See also ':help tab-page-intro' and ':help windows-intro'
09:00  Maahes: just displayed differently
09:00  the_isz: Maahes: one window can only show one buffer, but one buffer can be shown in multiple windows
09:01  the_isz: Maahes: did you work through vimtutor already? it's really helpful
09:01  DHulme: Maahes: your commands work for me; what do you get from :set cpo
09:02  Maahes: DHulme, .......let me guess, these commands don't belong in the .vimrc? set cpo gave me ....a return I don't know how to copy
09:03  Maahes: and yes I've been through vim tutor, it doesn't really cover this kind of thing, but mostly basic editing
09:03  DHulme: oh, just type it in; it'll be quicker
09:03  Maahes: DHulme, how do I make it reappear?
09:04  DHulme: run the same command again (in this case)
09:04  Maahes: cpoptions=aABceFs
09:06  DHulme: you do have the two map commands on separate lines in your .vimrc, right?
09:06  Maahes: DHulme, yes
09:07  DHulme: interesting; I wish I could spend more time on it, but I have to go to work
09:07  DHulme: number one suspect is that your .vimrc isn't being sourced for some reason; you can check whether that's the case by typing the commands directly into Vim's command line and seeing if they work then
09:08  Raimondi: :scriptnames   would tell if it's being loaded.
09:13  iaj: can I somehow do a grep on the result that :scriptnames gives?
09:13  Maahes: :scriptnames is listed as loaded
09:13  Maahes: er, my vimrc that is
09:13  Raimondi: iaj:  You could use :redir
09:14  Raimondi: Maahes: What's the output of  :verbose map <C-J>
09:15  Maahes: nl <C-W>j<C-W>
09:15  Maahes: nl = <NL>
09:15  Raimondi: Maahes: What about  :verbose map <buffer><C-J>
09:16  Maahes: no mapping found
09:17  Raimondi: So, when you press Ctrl+j it doesn't work?
09:17  Maahes: nope
09:18  Maahes: I don't have ctrl+j mapped to anything out of the application as far as I can tell either
09:19  Maahes: Does where it's put in the vimrc matter?
09:19  Maahes: It's at the bottom
09:20  spiiph: Maahes, check what happens if you do :<C-v><C-j>, without hitting enter. (It should print ^@)
09:20  Maahes: C-v sends me to Visual Block
09:20  Maahes: and prints nothing
09:21  Maahes: when I hit C-j
09:21  Raimondi: YOU lef the : out
09:21  Raimondi: s/lef/left/
09:21  Maahes: ah
09:21  spiiph: Maahes, details matter here.
09:21  Maahes: it prints ^@
09:23  Maahes: http://pastebin.com/DaiUAXbf this is my rc
09:24  Maahes: the maps are at the bottom
09:28  spiiph: I don't see anything wrong with it, except that you shouldn't have :set t_Co=256 in there. :P
09:28  spiiph: But that's not important for this issue
09:29  Maahes: i like zenburn :P
09:30  spiiph: zenburn doesn't require :set t_Co=256. Nothing does.
09:40  Maahes: okay, got it working, but now when switching between windows it makes the window disappear and hides the other open file, calling :vsplit again creates a new file
09:40  spiiph: It maximizes the current window. Hitting <C-k> after <C-j> ought to switch to the other window, and maximize that again
09:41  spiiph: Why don't you just learn the commands before starting to make mappings you may not even need?
09:41  Raimondi: vimgor: windows
09:41  vimgor: For a quick intro to vim's windows, buffers, and tabs, see http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/9031/windowsv.png and http://vim.pastey.net/115548
09:41  Raimondi: Maahes: I think that ^would help with the nomenclature.
09:42  Maahes: spiiph, what I would like is to get rid of the maximization
09:43  spiiph: Maahes, then you should understand the commands that your mapping consists of. :h CTRL-w should help
09:44  spiiph: And again, learn the commands before starting to optimize.

10:54  the_isz: iaj: if it doesn't work, try putting expr in a file and use the file as a -f parameter to your sed call. that might get rid of shell escaping problems.

13:48  Silex: wait no, you go i<Enter><Esc>p ?
13:49  FernandoBasso: Silex: If you yank then as lines, like: Vjjjjy it will paste in four lines. I don't know if would be possible to paste four lines "in the middle of a line".
13:49  nimred: FernandoBasso which way to map "+p to shortcut ?
13:50  Silex: FernandoBasso: yeah, I guess i<Enter><Esc>p is the way to go then
13:51  FernandoBasso: nimred: Not sure.
13:52  nimred: FernandoBasso ?
13:52  nimred: isn't it possible ?
13:52  FernandoBasso: nimred: It is. Only that I don't know.
13:52  FernandoBasso: Some one will son deliver a way to.
13:53  nimred: ok thannks for your help FernandoBasso
13:53  nimred: Can someone tell me which way ?
13:54  the_isz: nimred: if you want to install vim with xclipboard support but without gvim, you'll need to use abs.
13:55  nimred: the_isz anyway too late for that : gvim already is installed
13:55  the_isz: nimred: pacman -Rnsc gvim   is just a few letters away ;)
13:57  nimred: which way to map "+p to key shortcut ?
13:58 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
13:58  FernandoBasso:  :nmap <F7> "+p
13:59  FernandoBasso: This uses F7 for pasting the last thing you copied from somewhere else.
13:59  FernandoBasso: In normal mode.
14:00  nimred: FernandoBasso ok great thanks :)
14:21  gMinuses: Hi, guys. The vim7.3 windows installer has an options that integrates vim to visual studio. I've checked that and I have visual studio installed (before vim is installed). But I don't see how to enable vim mode in visual studio, any ideas?
14:38  creidiki: VIsVim doesnt work with recent versions, afaik
14:40  Silex: gMinuses: in my installation, in Tools menu I have a "vim" entry that simply loads the current file into vim
14:43  gMinuses: creidiki: I'm sure if it is VisVim.
14:45  gMinuses: Silex: sadly I don't have that entry in mine, but did you mean that by clicking that entry, vs opens a vim instance for you and load the file there?
14:45  Silex: yeah...
14:45  Silex: it's not much
14:45  Silex: or maybe I created that entry myself?
14:46  Silex: hum, yeah actually I probably created it myself ages ago, sorry
14:46  Silex: (Tools -> External tools -> Add a vim entry and see the wiki for the arguments)
14:47  gMinuses: Silex: thanks for the tip.
14:49  the_isz: i used to wonder what that ominous vs integration was supposed to be... until i finally created a virtual machine running linux to edit in. now i'm only using vs to compile and debug...
14:52  gMinuses: the_isz: yeah, shift the load to vim is probably a good idea, maybe the compilation can be done in vim too.
14:53  the_isz: gMinuses: see :help :make      for that, but only if your software is compilable under linux. which unfortunately doesn't account for me... yet.
14:54  dindinx: the_isz: :make is totally unrelated to linux.
14:54  the_isz: dindinx: true. sorry, i would've had to elaborate more to explain my point.
14:55  dindinx: the_isz: you can invoke any command you like with it (such as the VS compiler if needed)
14:56  gMinuses: added that to my to learn list. ;) thanks.
14:56  the_isz: dindinx: which would unfortunately yield vim unusable during compilation. i like vim as an editor, i try not to make it an ide.
14:58  gMinuses: maybe you can make it compile in the background? though not sure how to do that yet.
15:00  dindinx: the_isz: I still don't see the link you've made with "linux only".
15:01  gMinuses: Do you guys happen to know how I can :e an url? I'm under windows right now, and it tells me that wget or fetch is missing, but I have cygwin installed. Can I instruct it to look for them in cygwin?
15:04  astrojp: I want to simply change the color of my highlighted line in one of my vim colorschemes. Is it as simple as changing one value? Where do I found out how to do this?
15:05  gMinuses: astrojp: try :help colorscheme
15:05  idan: hey folks -- gotta question that google isn't being helpful on
15:06  idan: I'd like to add/remove text from the end of every line in a visual block selection
15:06  idan: say, delete one char from the end of every line selected
15:06  idan: or add something to the end of every line selected
15:07  astrojp: maybe 'hi CursorLine NickServ guibg=#efefefgui=none'

18:36  ChrisBuchholz: rson: hey - i dont know if you remember me from yesterday, but i try anyways. I found out that the problem with the difference between gnome-terminal and screen (and xterm) doesnt exist on other users on my computer, so the problem must be local to my ~/. Do you have a guess to which files i should take a closer look at?
18:37  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: ~/.bashrc perhaps.
18:37  FernandoBasso: ~/.Xdefaults or ~/.Xresources.
18:39  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i only have ~/.bashrc - the others doesnt exist on my system, so i guess it cant be them :P
18:39  ChrisBuchholz: i will take a look at my .bashrc
18:39  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: What was your problem again?
18:41  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: well, in gnome-terminal, the colorscheme in vim is fine. But when i use vim in GNU screen, its all wrong.
18:41  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: we used hours trying to figure it out yesterday, and came to the conclusion that is was not my .vimrc and .screenrc
18:42  FernandoBasso: But I hardly believe it could be bashrc's fault.
18:43  FernandoBasso: It seems more like an incompatibility thing.
18:43  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: yeah? really? That could be ... what?
18:44  FernandoBasso: Or, compiz. I have problems, (for instance) if I do 'gnome-screenshot -a' with compiz enabled (anyway I seldom use the gnome environment)
18:44  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I used screen with gnome-terminal already and did not have problems.
18:45  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: yeah, well, i just created a new user on my system, and it didnt cause problems - everything worked fine
18:45  ChrisBuchholz: and that is basically the same setup as my user has
18:45  ChrisBuchholz: though, i forgot to check if compiz was enabled, actually
18:45  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Try removing you colorcheme definition in ~/.vimrc, launch screen, launch vim from screen and then set the colorscheme to see what happens.
18:45  ChrisBuchholz: looked like it, but i'm not sure
18:47  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Try logging out of gnome, log into an TTY and do gconftool-2 --recursive-unset / WARNING: you'll remove all your personal configuration for gnome desktop.
18:47  FernandoBasso: Perhaps gnome config files are messed up.
18:48  FernandoBasso: Or, rm -Rv ~/.gnome2/  ~/.compiz/ ~/.nautilus/ ~/.gconf* from a tty and logged out of gnome.
18:48  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i just tried removing my colorscheme setup from .vimrc and do as you said - didnt do anything ;)
18:48  mgedmin: no .vimrc?
18:48  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: mm ?
18:48  mgedmin: sorry, .screenrc?
18:49  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: i have a .screenrc, yes?
18:49  mgedmin: does it do anything funky with terminal settings?
18:49  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: i dont know, but FernandoBasso and rson and others looked at it yesterday, and didnt find anything 'funky' in it :P
18:50  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: As other user, did you use the .vimrc and .screenrc you are using with your default user?
18:50  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: actually no. Just default setup. I will try copying my .vimrc .screenrc to the new user
18:50  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Yeah. Do that.
18:51  mgedmin: also try to reproduce the problem with vim -u NONE
18:51  FernandoBasso: What I would do is I would backup both files, and add the options line by line to catch the culprit.
18:51  belak: Who's the bot in here?
18:51  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: vim -u NONE shows same colorscheme in and out of screen in vim
18:52  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: mv ~/.vimrc{,.bkp} and try again.
18:52  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: what do that do - just curious ?
18:53  FernandoBasso: Also, the merit is no mine. -u NONE was not my suggestion. The credit goes to mgedmin ☺
18:53  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: It renames .vimrc to .vimrc.bkp
18:53  mgedmin: it skips loading your .vimrc
18:53  FernandoBasso: hehe
18:53  mgedmin: if you were asking about vim -u NONE
18:53  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso&mmgedmin: oh, right, sorry!
18:54  mgedmin: if you've a custom colorscheme, the next step would be to load itside in vim -u NONE and see if there are differences
18:54  ChrisBuchholz: no, i meant the {,.bkp} part of mv ~/.vimrc
18:55  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: if it worked with -u NONE (as mgedmin said) then the problem is actually in your ~/.vimrc.
18:55  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: if i do vim -u NONE and then :colorscheme molokai in screen, the problem is there again
18:56  mgedmin: both users?
18:56  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: are about to try on the other user
18:56  ChrisBuchholz: theres no way to do that without logging out, right ? :D
18:57  ChrisBuchholz: brb
19:00  spiiph: What's the problem anyway?
19:01  mgedmin: screen is the problem
19:03  Lars_G_: How do I commit with fugitive?
19:03  Lars_G_: I tried GCommit, it does open the commit comment file, but I can't edit it... when I do "o" or "O" it opens a new buffer with Master's md5
19:09  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso & mgedmin: just tested it in and out of screen, without any .vimrc on the other user where i go in vim and then set the colorscheme - works fine
19:09  FernandoBasso: chris_cooke: xinit /usr/bin/gnome-session -- :1 to start another session.
19:09  FernandoBasso: (if you have enough ram)
19:10  spiiph: mgedmin, I gathered that much. I meant, how does the problem manifest?
19:10  mgedmin: spiiph, <ChrisBuchholz> rson: hey - i dont know if you remember me from yesterday, but i try anyways. I found out that the problem with the difference between gnome-terminal and screen (and xterm) doesnt exist on other users on my computer, so the problem must be local to my ~/. Do you have a guess to which files i should take a closer look at?
19:10  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Bakcup your .vimrc file and add the options one by one while you are testing.

19:29  strull: Janos: what's a "replacement number" ?
19:30  FernandoBasso: strull: For some reason you example is only highlighting the text, but not actually changing the case of the first letter.
19:30  Janos: strull: like an increasing counter which says how many times this replace has been done

19:32  strull: FernandoBasso: oops, you want the other way round. use \u instead of \U
19:32  Janos: strull, i know vim keeps a count on how many replacements have been done since it tells me at the end but is it possible to access this number on the replace expression ?
19:32  nimred: FernandoBasso using "+p i have some encoding troubles
19:33  FernandoBasso: strull: It says it did a substituting, but the text remains the same.
19:33  FernandoBasso: :D
19:33  strull: Janos: what number, the final count or an increasing numnber for each match?
19:33  Janos: strull, increasing number for each match
19:34  strull: FernandoBasso: me fool me. use \l
19:34  FernandoBasso: strull:  :%s/\(\s*.\)/\u\l/  ?

19:42  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: It seem that you are using another gnome-terminal color profile in the other user.
19:42  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: well, the background is different, sure, but other than that?
19:43  rson: ChrisBuchholz: can you do ":set t_Co?" in the two situations with your user and say what it reports?
19:43  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Go to profile preferences and try changing the color.
19:43  ChrisBuchholz: damn, i hate logging/relogging :D
19:43  ChrisBuchholz: i'm actually not entirely sure of i did set colorscheme on 'the other user' ...
19:43  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: xinit /usr/bin/gnome-session -- :1 to start another session.
19:44  ChrisBuchholz: rson: will do!
19:44  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: as in?
19:44  spiiph: Looks like screen doesn't tell Vim that you have a terminal that supports 256 colours.
19:45  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: yeah, doesnt it?
19:45  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: 'as in?' (english is not my native lang) I did not understand. :D
19:45  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, only if you've configured it correctly.
19:45  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: to start another session? What do you mean? English not mine also :P
19:46  FernandoBasso: I'm pretty sure it is just the default gnome-terminal color profile.
19:46  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: i'll tell you - i dont even think i have configured it :D
19:46  ChrisBuchholz: anyhow - gonna log in to the other user and check
19:46  ChrisBuchholz: brb
19:46  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: To start another X session, witting having to logging out the current one. Log in in a TTY with this other user and issue that command.
19:46  FernandoBasso: s/witting/without/
19:47  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, well, checking :set t_Co? (while running vim as 'vim -u NONE -N') is the absolutely first thing to do.
19:50  mgedmin: screen does ... interesting things ... to some 256-color codes
19:50  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: i had forgot to set the colorscheme on the other user when i took the pictures, but the colors were still the same when i set colorscheme both in gnome-terminal and screen
19:51  mgedmin: ChrisBuchholz, was it the same colorscheme?
19:51  ChrisBuchholz: rson: on the other user, set t_Co? gave t_Co=8 both in gnome-terminal and screen on the other user. It gives t_Co=256 in both gnome-terminal and screen on this user
19:51  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: yes, molokai
19:54 * mgedmin searches for a pastebin for images
19:55  mgedmin: here: http://i.imgur.com/mSNne.png

Having tried several fonts on Windows, and several "set encoding=" values, still no luck. Any ideas anyone?
19:57  mgedmin: graywh++
19:58  mgedmin: you're absolutely right
19:58  mgedmin: TERM=xterm-256 screen
19:58  mgedmin: makes it work just fine
19:58  graywh: there you go
19:58  FernandoBasso: nimred: I think the source where you are copying from is not using utf-8.
19:59  nimred: FernandoBasso sure it is
19:59  ChrisBuchholz: mgedmin: altså lots of the other colors are different from withon screen and 'the other terminal' - looks like what i'm also experiencing
20:00  nimred: FernandoBasso you didn't read what i posted
20:00  FernandoBasso: nimred: Sorry.
20:00  FernandoBasso: I was merged into my problem that moment. I apologize.
20:00  ChrisBuchholz: So it seems like my only choice it to reset gnome config and that stuff?
20:01  nimred: FernandoBasso --> "is there someting to add to ~/.vimrc ? i already have "set encoding=utf-8" and "set fileencoding=utf-8" ; locale system settings are en_US.UTF-8 and in ~/.Xdefaults, i have : "URxvt*imLocale : en_US.UTF-8" ? any idea ?"
20:03  FernandoBasso: nimred: The problem is that you are copying a text from other encoding to vim and vim is set to utf-8. This does not automatically converts your source text to utf8.
20:03  FernandoBasso: But, I don't know what would be a solution for this.
20:04  FernandoBasso: nimred: What about if you (from inside vim do) :read <other file>
20:05  nimred: FernandoBasso the text itry to paste is text from terminal emulator which is it self utf8 (rxvt-unicode with "URxvt*imLocale : en_US.UTF-8" in ~/.Xdefaults as i already posted once more with locales :
20:05  nimred: [~]->> locale
20:05  nimred: LANG=en_US.UTF-8
20:05  nimred: LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  nimred: LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
20:05  spiiph: nimred, stop that.
20:05  nimred: LC_ALL=
20:05  consumerism: pastebin
20:06  nimred: so the text i try to paste is itself utf-8 encoding !
20:06  thumbs: nimred: consider using a pastebin.
20:06  Raimondi: nimred: use  http://vim.pastey.net
20:06  Raimondi: To paste more than one line of text
20:06  nimred: just read what i post to you first if you don't want me to paste there guys
20:06  thumbs: nimred: that's the wrong attitude
20:06  nimred: i told you my locales were utf-8
20:06  accipter: nimred: it doesn't work like that
20:06  nimred: you don't believe me
20:07  nimred: ah ah ah
20:07  spiiph: nimred, go away.
20:07  nimred: i won't tell you untill end of night that my system is utf-8 encoding set
20:07  jbwiv_: if I type :ls to get a list of buffers, is there a shortcut to chose one of those buffers, or do I then have to type :b#?
20:08  spiiph: jbwiv_, :b <number> or :b <partial file name><Tab>
20:08  nimred: FernandoBasso :read <other file> ? what do you mean ?
20:08  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: you mentioned something about resetting gnome config? do you you that would do it based on the data i have showed you?
20:09  FernandoBasso: nimred: That will read other's file content, and put in inside a vim buffer.
20:10  FernandoBasso: But as the text is from a terminal, that would not be possible.
20:10  jbwiv_: spiiph: yeah, I was hoping there was a way while having :ls show all buffers...sort of like ":ls" and then the number, instead of :ls, see the number, then :b plus the number
20:10  consumerism: is there a way to yank some text, make a visual selection, and the put that text with p multiple times (don't empty the register when i p)
20:10  FernandoBasso: Unless you redirect the terminal's output to a file and then issue the :read command.
20:11  spiiph: jbwiv_, you can easily create a command for that, but I recommend that you try buffer completion instead. It's much more efficient than selecting buffers by number
20:11  remyo: Is there a way to stop delete from moving things into the copy register?
20:11  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I'm not sure what to answer here. I just think that the deference is simply gnome-terminal colors config.
20:11  spiiph: remyo, delete doesn't do that.
20:11  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: so how would i do this?
20:11  remyo: spiiph: When I delete something, it copys it :|
20:11  jbwiv_: spiiph, ok, cool. thanks
20:11  strull: spiiph: ???
20:12  jbwiv_: spiiph: I see what you mean. thank you
20:12  spiiph: remyo, it puts it in the default register, not in "0, which is the register for the last yank.
20:12  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Just try going to gnome-terminal preferences, and change the 'built-in schemes' in the colors tab.
20:12  strull: remyo: try "_d
20:13  nimred: FernandoBasso :read <other file> works fine special glyphes
20:13  remyo: strull: Is there a way to make that the default behavior for all deletion?
20:13  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Or do gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal
20:13  strull: remyo: I doubt it
20:13  remyo: Alright
20:14  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: the colors did change, but theres still a big ddifferent between screen and gnome-terminal
20:14  FernandoBasso: nimred: What is 'glyphes' ?
20:14  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: So, try mutt.
20:14  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: what is mutt? :D
20:15  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: sorry to ask that twice, btw:P
20:15  ChrisBuchholz: ...i should step down with the number of smileys i type...
20:15  nimred: FernandoBasso special characters
20:16  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: Sorry. It is not mutt. I am mistaken.
20:16  FernandoBasso: nimred: It works that way?
20:16  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: hmm. but what is mutt, actually?
20:16  spiiph: Email client
20:17  remyo: strull: I guess what I'm trying to do is make copy / pasting easier. When I paste over something it copies what I pasted over. This really sucks for things I wanted to paste multiple times. And using "0p instead of p just feels very strange
20:17  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: google said that too, but i doubt that is what he meant
20:17  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: I thought it was like screen. I think it is not.
20:17  spiiph: FernandoBasso, you mean tmux
20:17  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: oh, i see...
20:17  FernandoBasso: spiiph: Yeah. Thanks.
20:18  strull: remyo: not sure, but try . (dot) after the first paste
20:18  spiiph: remyo, you could either make a mapping for "_d or for "0p
20:18  ChrisBuchholz: Would it be a bit too easy to just come to termes with the problem and just walk away from it without solving it first?
20:18  remyo: strull: Will try that. spiiph: Not a bad idea
20:18  remyo: Thanks
20:19  spiiph: np
20:21  remyo: strull: . doesn't seem to work. It won't work in visual mode and in normal it just repeats the delete
20:21  nimred: FernandoBasso i mean special characters are well displayed when using :read <other file>. When using "+p they are not
20:22  ChrisBuchholz: I guess i could try grapping the files from the other account and replacing it with 'my' files and see if that solved it, and if it did, then do a diff on them to check what is different between 'em. Which files do you reckon i should do this with?
20:24  d7777777: Is there heredoc in vim code?
20:24  d7777777: Or, how do I set a multi-line string in a readable way?
20:27  lamdk: whats the key sequence that appends to a register?  i keep hitting it on accident =\
20:27  lamdk: like it dosent replace the contents, but just adds it to the end
20:27  strull: lamdk: shift
20:27  deryni: Heh.
20:28  strull: d7777777: probably : let string="one
20:28  strull: \\ntwo
20:28  strull: \\nthree"
20:31  kingfishr_: how do you find/replace forward from your current position?
20:31  kingfishr_: for N lines
20:31  nimred: FernandoBasso ?
20:32  estragib: kingfishr_: ,+Ns/...
20:34  kingfishr_: estragib: thanks
20:35  Spidey01: t.e.s.t.
20:35  Spidey01: Worthless IRC client... I knew I should've compiled ircII
20:35  strull: failed
20:36  Spidey01: Just had XChat disappear from my tray, only to run xchat again and ghost myself. When suddenly before I can /nick up my ghost reconnects!
20:37  Spidey01: Sure enough the first xchat didn't crash, it just disappeared, and #vim's punt told the truth
20:37  Spidey01: Can we get a vim wiki page listing IRC clients for #vim that don't suck? :-D
20:38  strull: feel free to add one
20:38  tmr: Erc?
20:38 * tmr runs
20:39  Spidey01: Finding a non-sucking one is a little harder
20:39  spiiph: Just use irssi
20:39  Spidey01: Don't like it
20:39  Spidey01: Although I reckon, it doesn't suck
20:46  accipter: what is there to dislike about it?
20:46  Spidey01: Rubs me the wrong way
20:49  rson: ChrisBuchholz: if t_Co == 8 on the other user, then it's not working either.
20:49  sako: hey guys whats the plugin that will change my working directory to NERDTree's project i chose?
20:52  tlonim: in vim commandline how do i refer to a vim variable like ft for something like   :!ls *.=(echo &ft) ?
20:52  strull: tlonim: :he :exe
20:52  ChrisBuchholz: rson: well, it might not be 256 colors on the other user, but the colors are the same wether you use gnome-terminal or screen on the other user, which i guess is the impotant part?
20:52  ChrisBuchholz: whether*
20:52  tlonim: strull: ok..
20:56  ChrisBuchholz: Maybe i should get some dinner...
20:57  ChrisBuchholz: brb
21:03  DHulme: tlonim: your example won't work anyway, as ft isn't always the extension
21:03  ChrisBuchholz: back
21:04  tlonim: DHulme: yeah..that was just an example to illustrate
21:04  DHulme: good; just thought I should check
21:04  tlonim: DHulme: thanks.. i got it now ------  exe "!ctags -R --append=yes -f ~/Arch/vim/tags/".&ft.".tags ."

21:15  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, just make sure you're using gnome-256color in gnome-terminal, and screen-256color in screen.
21:15  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: actually, gnome-terminal uses term=xterm at the moment :D
21:15  spiiph: Yeah, that's not right.
21:16 --- Channel #vim was synced in 72 seconds
21:16  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: some bug in gnome-terminal on ubuntu, i've been told
21:16  Spidey01: some terminals set $TERM=xterm and $COLORTERM=wtfAmI
21:16  Spidey01: At least, terminal does.
21:17  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, it's not a bug. It's the gnome-terminal developers that are unable to create a proper configuration entry for $TERM
21:17  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: oh...
21:17  ChrisBuchholz: well okay then :P
21:17  spiiph: I.e., pure stupidity or negligence - take your pick.
21:17  graywh: or don't think it's important enough
21:17  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: but i guess, if its the same on both users, i guess it doesnt matter right?
21:18  spiiph: It may
21:18  mcantor: Is there any such somefunc such that :%somefunc/.oo/bar/g on a buffer containing "fooFoo" wil result in "barBar"?
21:18  ChrisBuchholz: hmm
21:18  spiiph: You said you had 256 colours in the configuration you're trying to fix, which isn't true if $TERM is xterm.
21:18  graywh: mcantor, no
21:18  mcantor: That is, how can I maintain the capitalization of existing patterns when I replace them with ;substitute?
21:18  spiiph: Since xterm is 8 olours.
21:18 * Spidey01 nods with spiiph 
21:18  mcantor: Damn.
21:18  ChrisBuchholz: well, spiiph and rson, i'm gonna go and try to get 256 colors working on the other user and see if screen also bugs there and then return with a result here.
21:19  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: oh!
21:19  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: i had no idea
21:19  ChrisBuchholz: well, spiiph, can this be easy fixed?
21:19  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, just set $TERM to gnome-256terminal in your .bashrc, or whatever, if you're using gnome-terminal, and use screen-256color in your .screenrc
21:19  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: okidoki
21:20  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: should it be gnome-256terminal or gnome-256color in my .bashrc, just to be sure?
21:20  graywh: by godlygeek: http://gist.github.com/111095
21:20  spiiph: Sorry, gnome-256color
21:21  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: superb
21:21  spiiph: Yes, use what graywh pasted
21:22  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph & graywh: will do, and thank you
21:25  phcn-luchs: how can i compile vim with gvim?
21:25  mcantor: graywh: Is it worth devoting the time to write a custom command SubWithCase that wraps :substitute, or should I just deal with it?
21:27  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: $TERM is now fixed
21:27  ner0x: How can I insert a \n with a replace?
21:27  ner0x: %s/ /\n/gc ?
21:27  spiiph: ner0x, :h sub-replace-special
21:27  ner0x: spiiph: Thanks!
21:27  spiiph: And no, it's \r, not \n that you should use
21:27  ChrisBuchholz: I will now go to the other user, fix $TERM also on that, and then see what happens with gnome-terminal color vs screen color
21:28  ChrisBuchholz: brb
21:35  tlonim: for equality checking will glob or RE work ?
21:35  tlonim: something like  if &term == "screen*" || .....
21:37  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: now the other user has t_Co=256 and term=gnome-256color in gnome-terminal and t_Co=256 and term=screen-256color in screen, and the colorscheme still show the same as it should
21:37  ssice: and it's also not an option por me switching to Linux just to edit code (I do sometimes, though)
21:37  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, that sounds good. And your original user?
21:38  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: no different, still
21:38  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: well - the settings are right (term and t_Co) but the colorscheme still differ
21:40  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, the only thing I can think of then, is that you've changed the colour palette for gnome terminal, and that these changes aren't propagated to screen.
21:41  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: yeah, could be. Can i delete some folder or file to reset gnome-terminal?
21:43  spiiph: Probably somewhere under ~/.config. Someone suggested a way of using gconf to reset settings too
21:43  spiiph: Earlier
21:45  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: yeah... I should startto get more familiar with irssi, so i can find these things again :D
21:46  ner0x: What's the easiest way to debug an error that doesn't give you a line number? Like an exceptions caught?
21:47  ner0x: Ignore that, wrong channel.
21:48  Caelum: Hello, how do I use the visual studio plugin?
21:50  tlonim: i have "inoremap <S-right> <Esc>:bnext<CR>" bound.. but sometimes it ends up deleting some text.. any reason why ?
21:50  graywh: vim not properly detecting your terminal's shift-right
21:51  tlonim: graywh: but it works many a time..fails only sometimes
21:52  tlonim: how can i debug this ?
21:52  rindolf: Hi Caelum , long time.
21:53  tlonim: graywh: actually it is occurring more often now..
21:54  deryni: Remote vim over a slow link?
21:54  tlonim: deryni: nope..local
21:55  tlonim: actually it happens when i do a particular set of moves
21:57  Caelum: rindolf: hey
21:59  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: Can you please tell me again you idea for resetting gnome-terminal configuration to default?
21:59  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/gnome-terminal
22:02  ChrisBuchholz: FernandoBasso: thanks!
22:03  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: it didnt work to reset gnome-terminal, i'm afraid
22:03  FernandoBasso: ChrisBuchholz: :)
22:11  ehamberg: can i undo “:syn keyword Statement foo” without clearing the whole Statement group and re-add all but “foo”?
22:11  graywh: nope
22:13  ehamberg: ok. :-)
22:13  belak: Is there a way to look up java documentation in vim?
22:15  Dulak: how do you make gvim work with the X clipboard?
22:15  gkatsev: Dulak: "+ and "*
22:15  deputydink: belak: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=358
22:16  belak: Thanks deputydink
22:16  kalleth: omg
22:16  kalleth: you can do that with vim?
22:16  kalleth: so that yanking goes to x clipboard?
22:17  gkatsev: kalleth: "+ and "*
22:17  Dulak: how do I make vim use the system clipboard by default from the menus?  Like I hilight something and hit Edit->Copy it does not go into the clipboard, I'd like to make it default to the clipboard
22:17  kalleth: that's been annoying me ALL WEEK!
22:17  Dulak: s/vim/gvim/
22:18  kalleth: yeah, i use gvim
22:18  gkatsev: Dulak: i think it may be an option in guioptions, check that.
22:18  Dulak: gkatsev: thx
22:18  gkatsev: Dulak: why not just "+y?
22:18  Spidey01: If vim was built with support for it, it also works from the terminal kalleth
22:18  kalleth: :D
22:19  kalleth: omgomgomg
22:19 * kalleth emails that snippet to himself @ work
22:19  gkatsev: kalleth: what snippet?
22:19  kalleth: i mean the last 20 lines of irc scrollback
22:19  gkatsev: oh, lol
22:19  gkatsev: kalleth: it is all there under :h " and stuff
22:20  kalleth: =]
22:20  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph & FernandoBasso & rson: i just noticed that the colors in gnome-terminal and screen are the same if i do, e.g. an ls.
22:20  kalleth: i had no idea
22:20  Dulak: gkatsev: that's what it does by default, but when I paste I get nothing from the clipboard
22:20  gkatsev: Dulak: "+p
22:20  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph & FernandoBasso & rson: could that be just because ls doesnt use 'as many' colors, or?
22:21  Scala: ChrisBuchholz: Are you using screen?
22:21  Scala: ChrisBuchholz: If you aren't getting all of the colors you want in vim & you're using screen, you have to configure a few things in your .screenrc and your .vimrc
22:22  ChrisBuchholz: Scala: i wont sound arrogant, but we have tried all sorts of different configurations the last two days - but hit me!
22:23  Scala: ChrisBuchholz: 1 sec
22:24  Scala: screenrc: http://gist.github.com/635032
22:24  Scala: I think the first 7 lines are necessary
22:25  ChrisBuchholz: Scala: the thing is - it works fine on other users on this computer which dont have that, but it doesnt on this
22:25  spiiph: Scala, that looks like a hack to enforce 256 colours when using the xterm terminfo.
22:26  Scala: and in your .vimrc put "set t_Co=256"
22:26  spiiph: NO
22:26  Scala: oh
22:26  spiiph: Don't do that.
22:26  Scala: who knows
22:26  Scala: hah
22:26  ChrisBuchholz: Scala: i have that already
22:26  Scala: spiiph: Why not?
22:26  spiiph: You should never put :set t_Co in your .vimrc
22:26  ChrisBuchholz: or do i...
22:26  Scala: hahaha
22:26  spiiph: Because it's unnecessary, and you might be lying.
22:26  spiiph: You should use the correct terminfo
22:27  Scala: Hey-- I'm just saying what I've been using for the last year and has been working fine
22:27  spiiph: Doesn't mean it's right.
22:27  Scala: *shrug*
22:27  Scala: just chill out man
22:28  Scala: What do you mean by "I might be lying"
22:28  spiiph: Setting t_Co to 256 is such a common misconception that it's worth stopping. :P
22:28  ChrisBuchholz: Scala: the thing is, both $TERM and t_Co is correct in both gnome-terminal and screen. Still, it doesnt work
22:28  gkatsev: Scala: do you use scala?
22:28  spiiph: You might not be using a terminal that supports 256 colours, while Vim thinks you are.
22:28  Scala: gkatsev: Hah, no, not yet
22:28  Scala: spiiph: Yes
22:29  Scala: I don't think screen even supports 256
22:29  elasticdog: Scala: a better idea is to use 'if &t_Co == 256' to test and then fix your terminfo
22:29  spiiph: Scala, sure it does.
22:29  elasticdog: Scala: it does
22:29  spiiph: I've been using that configuration for several years.
22:29  Scala: Ah
22:29  Scala: I think my colorscheme does some t_Co checks
22:29  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: i was thinking. Since i get the right colors when doing, e.g. an 'ls' in gnome-terminal and screen, could this problem actually be within Vim?
22:30  spiiph: ChrisBuchholz, sounds really odd.
22:30  spiiph: But ls usually uses less colours
22:30  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: which part?
22:31  spiiph: That the problem should be Vim's fault, if it reports the correct number of colours
22:31  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: yeah i thought of that too. I dont remember who posted that picture earlier were about half og the colors were right, and half were not in a screen vs another terminal
22:31  ChrisBuchholz: spiiph: could be ls just uses the colors that fits
22:32  ChrisBuchholz: but what is up with this termcap/terminfo?
22:32  ChrisBuchholz: is it something resetable?
22:42  kingfishr_: Is there a way to move to the previous jump within this file? Like ctrl-o, but not switch to the previous buffer i was editing and instead only move between jumps in this buffer.
22:43  kingfishr_: I have all my files laid out nicely with splits and so ctrl-o just screws that up when it switches all my buffers around.
22:46 * strull listens. For the exact same reason he rarely uses c-o
22:49  akosch: i have a little problem with file completion: i'm coding in windows, so vim completes my paths with backslashes (\) as the path separator.
22:49  akosch: but i would like simple slashes (/) for my php coding
22:50  spiiph: :h 'shellslash
22:51  akosch: great! thank you very much...
22:51  akosch: can i somehow only enable this for php files?
22:52  kingfishr_: strull: Hmm, here's an SO post from a while back with the same question, but it never got a satisfactory answer :( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/843589/unable-to-limit-ctrl-o-to-open-only-current-buffers-in-vim
22:52  gkatsev: http://bitbucket.org/sjl/gundo.vim/src
22:52  Spidey01: akosch: using the filetype system and autocmds
22:53  spiiph: akosch, no, it's a global variable.
22:53  Spidey01: spiiph: won't that screw up certain plugins? (E.g. things that shell out to cmd)
22:53  spiiph: It might
22:53  belak: Alright, I'm trying the plugin... I can get it to run, but it won't open firefox
22:54  belak: It says :call OpenJavadoc() at the bottom, so it's doing somethin
22:56  kingfishr_: gkatsev: That looks pretty cool.
22:57  gkatsev: yeah
22:57  gkatsev: there was already a histwin plugin, but that didnt have the visual component
22:57  gkatsev: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1807008
22:58  Raimondi: The tree is beautiful.
22:58  gkatsev: that is my first follow on my bitbucket account :)
23:00 --- sorah_off is now known as sora_h
23:01  belak: Is there a script to add barebones javadoc comments?
23:01  gkatsev: probably
23:01  belak: And if so, what is it?
23:02  gkatsev: there are probably several ones
23:02  kingfishr_: belak, a bit of googling shows jcommenter.vim as one option. I've never used it though.
23:04 --- CHOCOBY is now known as chocoby
23:16  dpecka: heya, howto show please ??strange characters ..
23:16  dpecka: i know
23:17  dpecka: vim -e, and pff. ^@ in blue colour .. what's that ?
23:18  spiiph: A NUL character.
23:20  dpecka: spiiph: sorry .. bad Q: .. howto select them in perl
23:21  spiiph: I don't get it
23:22  Raimondi: By asking in #perl? :)
23:33  Ecco: Hi everyone
23:33  Ecco: I'm reading a vim tutorial
23:33  Ecco: and it says that "cw" should display a "$" at the end of the word I'm changing
23:33  Ecco: it does not
23:33  Ecco: it erases the word, and puts me in insert mode
23:33  Ecco: which is ok, but I wonder why my setup is different from the doc
23:36  Raimondi: Ecco: cw deletes until the end of word.
23:36  Ecco: oh, ok
23:37  Ecco: Raimondi: http://i.imgur.com/W5xEz.png
23:37  Ecco: That's an extract from my O'Reilly "Learning vi and vim" document
23:38  Raimondi: IN that example it delets a and leavs $ because the last is not part of the word as Vim understands it, see :h word
23:39 * Raimondi hates this old keyboard
23:39  spiiph: Ecco, that's how vi works.
23:39  spiiph: Vim opted to update the line instead
23:40  spiiph: You can get the old behaviour back with :h 'cpoptions
23:40 * Spidey01 likes the old behaviour
23:41  Ecco: Oh, thanks
23:41  Ecco: Thanks a lot :-)
