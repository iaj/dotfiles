00:58  Rakko: Is there a way to reload an ftplugin? Should I just unset b:did_ftplugin and re-source the ftplugin?
00:58  spiiph: Rakko, just reload the file

01:05  aleray: sorry forget about what I've asked
01:05  aleray: it works
01:06  Rakko: oh, cool, aleray
01:06  aleray: ;-)
01:06  Rakko: I was just looking for the answer
01:06 --- Channel #vim was synced in 80 seconds
01:07  Rakko: spiiph: which file did you mean for me to reload?
01:10  spiiph: The file you're editing
01:11  Rakko: Oh. That doesn't do it.
01:12  Rakko: The problem is that the ftplugin does let &l:path = s:ruby_path
01:12  Rakko: And I have a function that I intend to change the ruby_path the ftplugin uses
01:12  Rakko: I don't know how to get the function to actually change the script's path, though
01:14  Rakko: More information: the ftplugin uses the value of g:ruby_path, if it exists
01:15  Rakko: So the function I made to create the path sets that. That way, my own path gets used in the ftplugin, but only *if* the ftplugin hasn't been loaded yet.
01:15  Rakko: So I would like to reload the plugin when my plugin runs.
01:16  Rakko: s/my plugin/my function/
01:18  evilgeenius: Is it possible to enable mouse support in vim?  (not gvim)
01:18  Rakko: yes
01:18  Rakko: don't ask me how, though :)
01:19  Rakko: evilgeenius: :set mouse=a
01:21  Rakko: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_the_mouse_for_Vim_in_an_xterm
01:32  evilgeenius: Rakko:  thanks
01:32  Rakko: ah, I found out how to do it
01:33  evilgeenius: Is there a way to see if any action has been assigned to a key? e.g. see if anything is assigned to Ctrl-L
01:33  Rakko: yes. :verbose map <C-L>
01:33  Rakko: and for insert and command line mode, :verbose map! <C-L>
01:37  evilgeenius: Strange, when I press <C-l>, vim flashes...
01:38  evilgeenius: but it says nothing is mapped onto it
01:39  Rakko: then it's using the default function
01:39  Rakko: which is to redraw the screen
01:41  spiiph: evilgeenius, :h CTRL-L

02:07  gamefreak264: Ooh, :helpgrep, I'm going to try that :P
02:08  Rakko: athena gui... I have to try that out, just out of masochism
02:08  Rakko: I just tried mouse=a in xterm and it seems pretty nice
02:09  jamessan: Rakko: well, he currently uses the motif/lesstif gui so that he can choose XLFD fonts, but I'm thinking of changing the Debian packaging from lesstif to athena
02:09  Rakko: if anyone here is involved in the vim website, I just found that http://vim.org/ doesn't work. Someone might want to change that.
02:09  jamessan: yeah, that's a known limitation :)
02:10  Rakko: jamessan: what package?
02:10  jamessan: Rakko: vim
02:11  Rakko: what package contains the gtk vim?
02:12  jamessan: vim-gtk
02:13  jamessan: vim-lesstif is the lesstif package (surprise)
02:14  jamessan: Rakko: http://mid.gmane.org/a7f47829-b533-4003-bc11-e4f7e40155e1@s9g2000yqd.googlegroups.com
02:14  Rakko: and is the GUI binary for all called 'gvim'?
02:14  jamessan: yup
02:15  Rakko: I use 'gvim' as the name for GUI MacVim but I'm not sure other Mac users do
02:15  jamessan: well, the binary for all of the packages is vim.<variant> and then Debian's alternatives system takes care of symlinking /usr/bin/{g,}vim to the right binary
02:15  skizzhg: vim-athena ? yessss *_*
02:15  jamessan: so vim.gtk, vim.lesstif, etc
02:15  Rakko: ugh, gmane
02:16  jamessan: skizzhg: do you currently use the vim-lesstif package?
02:16  skizzhg: jamessan, no, i have the gtk one, but just fot clipboard support
02:17  skizzhg: i use it once in a month
02:17  jamessan: Rakko: do you use some other site for reading mailing lists?
02:19  Rakko: I use an email client
02:19  Rakko: :)
02:20  Rakko: did that mailing list message have any replies? it didn't list any
02:21  jamessan: Rakko: click on the subject and it'll show you the replies.  nothing useful came out of it, though
02:21  Rakko: oh
02:21  Rakko: that's one of my issues with gmane... bad interface
02:21  jamessan: Rakko: and I meant for when you don't have the mail in your mail client ;)
02:21  Rakko: I know :)
02:21  Rakko: I just google and use whatever comes up, honestly
02:21  Rakko: but I don't like the proliferation of duplicate messages
02:22  jamessan: Rakko: the UI has some deficiencies, but I've found it to be the most useful site for that sort of service
02:22  Rakko: ok
03:00  Rakko: Oh, wow :D
03:00  Rakko: vim-athena is funky
03:00  Rakko: its menus don't look like what I think of as Athena
03:00  jamessan: Rakko: about as funky as vim-lesstif/motif I'd imagine
03:00  Rakko: yeah
03:01  Rakko: This looks pretty motif-like. Does it implement 3d widgets itself, or am I using something like xaw3d?
03:03  Rakko: I can't get A- to work in it
03:06  jamessan: Rakko: depends on what you built against
03:09  Rakko: does it not support multiple GUI windows?
03:09  jamessan: huh?
03:10  Rakko: multiple frames
03:10  jamessan: none of the Vim guis do.  you just start multiple instances
03:10  Rakko: MacVim fakes it pretty well then
03:10  jamessan: well, MacVim may have patched it in
03:10  Rakko: you're right; registers don't carry over between MacVim frames
03:13  qfr: Any vim scripters around? I am trying to modify syntax/2html.vim so it no longer turns \t into 8 spaces. This happens around line 874 but when I take out that loop it turns all tabs into "^I" sequences in the HTML output instead - I am quite puzzled by that. Is the HtmlFormat function responsible for that?
03:14  qfr: I just want the tabs to remain tabs - I am processing the output programmatically. I am employing vim syntax highlighting in a pastebin.
03:18  Rakko: Hmm
03:18  Rakko: ^I *is* tab in ASCII
03:20  qfr: I fixed it, nevermind, the strtrans was responsible
03:20  qfr: "\t" is tab, "^I" is a cirumflex followed by a capital I
03:22  Rakko: ohhh, I see
03:24  Rakko: ah, athena vim draws its own scrollbars
03:24  Rakko: but other stuff is dependent on the specific xaw you use
03:47  nate-: how can I run a command (:something) on vim startup?
03:48  strull: nate-: :he vimrc
03:48  jamessan: nate-: what are you trying to do?
03:48  nate-: strull: obviously I'll need to place it in my .vimrc, but I'm not sure of the syntax to get the job done
03:49  nate-: jamessan: I want to run :DoShowMarks! on vim startup
03:49  jamessan: nate-: plugins aren't loaded until after your vimrc has finished being sourced.  you'll need to use an autocmd, specifically the VimEnter one
03:49  nate-: kk
03:49  nate-: that sounds like what i'm after
03:50  nate-: cheers guys
03:50  nate-: cool, autocmd looks very interesting... heaps of events
04:01  Rakko: how do I enable an alt/meta key in athena vim?

06:16  redscare: hello. with the SuperTab plugin in vim 7.3, if I set the default completion to "context", it still doesn't seem to recognize path names or any sort of context. Does anyone know how to fix this behavior?
06:17  Rakko: hmm, not sure
06:17  Rakko: I just installed that today, but I removed it because I already had <Tab> set for snipmate and it was confusing
06:20  redscare: Rakko: nvm, I fixed it. btw, if u want snippets that work w/supertab (and have regex searching and other nifty features) look at ultisnips
06:22  Rakko: thanks :)
06:26  emes: i'm having trouble with gvim displaying the text at the bottom (--INSERT--, etc). I'm using xmonad. any ideas?
06:36 --- itmorr is now known as rromti
06:43  literal: emes: any ideas about what? you haven't described your problem very well
06:44  emes: literal: the text that is usually displayed at the bottom is not displayed. it's not completely reproducible
06:46  emes: I know it's strange, but possibly someone else here experienced it
06:47  jamessan: emes: does ":set showmode" help?
06:49  emes: jamessan: it doesn't even display the ":" when I type :. Also on one occasion it got "stuck" in insert mode
06:49  emes: seems to be just generally buggy
06:49  emes: but I don't have any issues with vim, only gvim
06:50  jamessan: emes: then it seems like xmonad's not reporting the proper desktop size to gvim so gvim is making itself larger than the screen size. at least that would explain not being able to see the : line
06:53  emes: jamessan: i'll see if I can find a way to make it consistently reproducible

07:31  Axioplase_: djszapi: Try escaping the "#"'s

07:35  Rakko: what are the #s supposed to do?
07:35  djszapi: no idea
07:36  Rakko: ah
07:36  Rakko: Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
07:36  Rakko: 	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
07:36  Rakko: 	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
07:36  Rakko: 	      windows.
07:36  Rakko: sorry
07:37  Rakko: maybe your chroot one doesn't have highlighting for some reason
07:37  djszapi: c-* works fine on a word.
07:37  djszapi: which highlights all the occurences.
07:38  Rakko: I think this is a different kind of highlighting
07:38  djszapi: no idea really.
07:38  djszapi: I got this line 3-4 years ago from somewhere :)
07:38  Rakko: this is about syntax highlighting
07:38  djszapi: and it has been working on the host since then.
07:39  Rakko: if you don't care about the color or styling of the text, just take out all %#.*#

07:41  lumgwada: djszapi: is that the same for both environments? It's just what the error E539 message is pointing to. I don't really know

07:44 --- cmarques_ is now known as cmarques
08:07  Maxdamantus: Hmm.. Shouldn'd 4cw replace the next four words with what you type, four times?
08:08  Maxdamantus: So like d4w4i
08:09  waterbourne: 4cw is 'change next four words'
08:09 --- k23z__ is now known as spetrea-home
08:10  Maxdamantus: Hm, would make more sense if it was "change next word, four times"
08:10  Maxdamantus: 4 times cw
08:10  Maxdamantus: I think
08:11  waterbourne: make a quick macro
08:11  Maxdamantus: Meh, just trying to understand the logic behind the number before commands
08:12  frogonwheels: Maxdamantus: nah.. te count goes to the operation.. so  4cw == c4w
08:12  Maxdamantus: Because it seems to mean that many times the following, with a few exceptions
08:12  frogonwheels: Maxdamantus: .. to the movement rather.
08:12  Maxdamantus: Ah.
08:12  Maxdamantus: So what about 4a?
08:12  frogonwheels: Maxdamantus: it's pretty consistent.  4a 4i  &c  have no movement.
08:13  frogonwheels: Maxdamantus: so they apply to the 'a' operation
08:14  Maxdamantus: Mk.
08:19  the_isz: vim is so awesome... i just noticed that typing "vertical rightbelow sfind" (which i do very often) takes rather long, even when using tab-completion. so i quickly read the docs and came up with "cnoremap vrs vertical rightbelow sfind" which works perfectly. life is good :)
08:21  DHulme: you do know you can abbreviate every command, right?
08:21  DHulme: :vert bel sf
08:22  the_isz: DHulme: yeah, but learning the abbreviations is more tedious to me than just defining a simple mapping :)
08:22  DHulme: there's not much to learn, it's always as much of the command as needed to make it unique
08:23  lumgwada: the_isz: cmaps can bite you too.  (vrs in a file name) I generally use nnoremaps for those things
08:23  DHulme: anyway, your abbreviation is still shorter
08:23  DHulme: lumgwada: true; in the same situation I'd probably have defined my own command
08:23  the_isz: DHulme: right, but you need to know that 'bel' is the part of 'rightbelow' you need to type ;)
08:24  the_isz: lumgwada: that's true...
08:24  DHulme: well, the abbreviation for :rightbelow is actually :rightb, it's just that :belowright is a synonym for it
08:24  jorrit: Hi
08:24  the_isz: hi jorrit
08:36  lewis1711: Alright, here's the deal. vim people are constantly telling me to use the hjkl keys instead of the arrow keys, because it keeps your fingers on the home row. but what about all the times you have to use the : operator? it's easier to type that from the arrow keys
08:36  godlygeek: lewis1711: on a standard qwerty keyboard?  no it isn't...
08:37  lewis1711: also the search operator...unless you guys suggest using your little finger for that, in which case I will tell you that if I wanted RSI in my pinky I'd use emacs
08:37  patrick85: lewis1711: remap it
08:37  lewis1711: well you have to press shift
08:37  patrick85: I use <SPACE> to inser ":" in normal mode
08:37  lewis1711: laptop keyboard here, this may be why
08:37  lewis1711: that's actually a really clever idea
08:37  DHulme: you don't use the same hand for pressing shift and :, do you?
08:38  patrick85: nmap <space> :
08:38  lewis1711: yeah, I do
08:38  DHulme: no wonder you're worried about RSI
08:38  patrick85: ^^
08:38  patrick85: lewis1711: you shouldn't
08:38  DHulme: every typist knows you always use the opposite shift key to the key you're pressing
08:38  lewis1711: huh, I never do that
08:39  godlygeek: the real reason for not using the arrow keys isn't that avoiding them keeps your fingers on the home row, it's that repeatedly moving a single character at a time is just about the worst way you could possibly move between two points.
08:39  waterbourne: and real vim users don't use hjkl that much
08:39  lewis1711: right, you want to use e and E more
08:39  DHulme: unless they have relativenumber turned on ;)
08:39  lewis1711: and all that
08:40  Maxdamantus: Hm. On Dvorak, : is right next to left shift
08:40  waterbourne: or f, F, /, ?
08:40  godlygeek: vimgor: movement
08:40  vimgor: In normal mode, all of these keys can move the cursor: ` # $ % ^ * ( ) 0 _ - + w W e E t T I o O { } [[ [] ][ ]] [m [M ]m ]M [( ]) [{ ]} | A f F ge gE gg G g0 g^ g$ g, g; gj gk gI h H j k l L ; ' z. z<CR> z- zz zt zb b B n N M , / ? <C-b> <C-d> <C-e> <C-f> <C-h> <C-i> <C-o> <C-t> <C-u> <C-y> - learn to use all of them
08:40  lewis1711: :|
08:41  lewis1711: alright, but then i am going to have to forget a lot of other things, like my own birthday and my mothers face
08:41  DHulme: as long as you don't forget your mother's birthday you'll be alright
08:42  godlygeek: if you're moving a single character at a time to get around in vim, you're really missing the point entirely
08:42  Maxdamantus: Mmm.. My arrow keys are broken but I still haven't bothered to learn hjkl
08:42  Maxdamantus: Because I very rarely move one character
08:43  godlygeek: vim fanatics aren't fanatics because of any particular advanced features (indeed, vim's syntax highlighting is slow, it didn't get spell checking until 7.0, its code folding is frustrating to say the least, etc)
08:43  godlygeek: we're fanatical because of the infinite combinability of operators and movements - because we can edit faster in vim than any other editor, because vim lets us move around in ways that no other editor can.
08:44  the_isz: a flaming speech :)
08:44  lewis1711: ok, I looked up how to pagedown... ^Y....what is ^?
08:44 * Maxdamantus just wishes other GUIs would allow for movement either like in vim or emacs/readline/etc
08:44  godlygeek: it's all about philosophy - "home row" misses the point entirely.  :)
08:44  the_isz: lewis1711: control
08:45  Maxdamantus: Probably the emacs one for the most part
08:45  the_isz: lewis1711: i learning 10-finger typing only recently. took me a few weeks to get used to, but it's definetly worth the effort.
08:45  godlygeek: lewis1711: and, ^Y scrolls the page one line at a time - you might want ctrl-f or ctrl-d instead (full page scroll and half page, respectively)
08:45  the_isz: s/learning/learned/
08:47  lewis1711: I keep coming back to vim despite the keybindings....just because it's so damn nice to configure
08:48  the_isz: lewis1711: "despite the keybindings"... i hear torches being lit^^
08:48  lewis1711: haha
08:50  lewis1711: well it is confusing...I mean ^F goes down and ^B goes up.... but then b goes backwards and ...e goes forwards:/
08:51  the_isz: lewis1711: try to learn 10-finger typing and all those wonderful vim movements and i bet you'll like them
08:52  the_isz: lewis1711: it won't matter to you which key you press for long. after few days it'll just be a reflex. you'll have to think about which combination you're pressing to achieve something if you want to tell someone.
