15:15  mgedmin: buffer number is %n
15:16  mgedmin: bufnr("$") will return the last buffer number
15:16  mgedmin: you can embed it with %{}
15:18  mitsuhiko: hi
15:18  mitsuhiko: does anyone know a ppa with vim 7.3 for ubuntu?
15:18 * mgedmin built vim 7.3 from sources
15:19  remi: mgedmin: thanks!
15:27  r1k0: are there any vim7 rpm available for download?

16:27  kurkale6ka: Hi, is there a way to know what the current mode is?
16:33  Scala: kurkale6ka: What do you mean?
16:33  Scala: command vs insert vs visual?
16:34  kurkale6ka: Scala: yes, vs normal, via vimscript
16:34  Scala: Oh, with vimscript.  not sure
16:35  kurkale6ka: it seems like there is no way
16:35  Scala: kurkale6ka: Did you check google? http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/eval.html#mode()
16:36  kurkale6ka: Scala: what about that link?
16:36  Scala: That seems to be what you're looking for
16:37  kurkale6ka: Scala: no, not sure
16:37  Scala: How is it now what you're looking for? "mode([expr]) - Return a string that indicates the current mode."
16:38  kurkale6ka: Scala: usefull only for the statusline... the help says it
16:39  Scala: kurkale6ka: It doesn't say only the statusline. It says it's useful for the statusline, but I don't see why you can't use it in any script
16:40  kurkale6ka: Scala: I've tried already! from help: | In most other places it always returns "c" or "n"
16:40  Scala: Dunno then
16:41  kurkale6ka: yeah

16:52  Tekhne: in a *map, how can i denote control-shift-c? i've tried "<C-S-c>", but that didn't work.
16:53  graywh: you can't shift an ascii control character
16:53  Tekhne: graywh: okay
16:53  Tekhne: what about control-meta-c?
16:54  graywh: no modifiers
16:54  Tekhne: so it's either control-c or meta-c, but no combos?
16:54  graywh: although, a misbehaving terminal (like rxvt) might send <Esc><C-c> when you hit meta-ctrl-c
16:55  Tekhne: thanks
16:57  macrobat: hello! i found that :set iskeyword doesn't apply to other buffers. i was thinking setting up some autocmd. what event and pat would be useful for that?
16:58  graywh: probably FileTYpe
16:58  graywh: FileType
17:00  macrobat: would  "FileType *"   work?
17:01  graywh: sure, but why do you want to change it globally?
17:03  macrobat: i find it annoying, not being able to operate on words with -,~,/,! or other chars in it
17:04  graywh: that really depends on the syntax, doesn't it?
17:05  macrobat: i usually want to use paths and hyphenated words, i can't imagine when i wouldn't
17:06 * mgedmin finds it very useful to have ctrl-w delete until the parent directory when dealing with paths
17:08  iaj: agreed.
17:08  macrobat: thank you graywh, it seems to work like i want :D
17:09  macrobat: i'd like to delete until the parent directory in the shell, though
