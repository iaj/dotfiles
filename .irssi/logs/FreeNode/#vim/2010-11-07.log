21:11  Zolrath: Thanks creidiki, I'll try out neocomplcache for a week and decide!
21:12  sh1mmer: I was wondering if anyone know how to reload snipmate snippets without restarting
21:12  Zolrath: MarcWebers snipmate fork does that
21:13  sh1mmer: did the original author abandon?
21:13  sh1mmer: or are they parallel?
21:14  Zolrath: parallel I believe, he just wanted some changes that weren't in the main tree
21:15  sh1mmer: oh ok
21:15  sh1mmer: thanks for the hint
21:15  Zolrath: No problem
21:24  rindolf: Hi all.
21:35  djszapi: Hello, there is a new QML language provided by Nokia ending with '.qml', how can I tell to my vim to recognize it as a javascript file ?
21:37  mgedmin: djszapi, :h ftdetect
21:38  djszapi: is not it just one line in vimrc that someone can tell me ?
21:39  mgedmin: it's one line in ~/.vim/ftdetect/qml.vim
21:39  mgedmin: au BufRead,BufNewFile *.qml setf qml
21:39  mgedmin: sorry, setf javascript
21:40  djszapi: ty.
22:01  homekevin: would there be a problem with just putting that in .vimrc?
22:01  homekevin: I guess maybe if you turned off filetype detection...

23:08  miguel000: Can someone explain this to me: in my vim showcmd is NOT set by default, and verbose set showcmd? points to a file, that does not mention it either. my vim runs in nocompatible mode. Its annoying for me, hat i do not understand where it is set, even if I can easily override it in my .vimrc.
23:11  estragib: it is set automatically to its respective default when 'comptabible' or 'nocp' is set
23:11  estragib: uh *compatible
23:13  estragib: oh, you said that. it *should* be anyway :)
23:14  miguel000: estragib: i say it should be set when I run in nocompatible mode, if i understand the manual properly
23:14  miguel000: but this is not the case im afraid
23:15  estragib: the way i read the help, if you set nocp it's reset to the vi default of noshowcmd
23:15  estragib: i think there's a typo in the help actually
23:17  miguel000: estragib: my help says its set to the Vim default when i go for nocompatible
23:17  miguel000: and vim default is ON
23:17  estragib: right, sorry. got confused there.
23:18  miguel000: np. hmm Ill try setting and unsetting compatible and see what happens
23:19  estragib: just did that. unless i did sth stupid, it unsets sc when i set cp, but doesn't set sc when i set nocp again.
23:19  miguel000: exactly what happens to me
23:20  estragib: oh, "default: off for unix"
23:20  mgedmin: gah, reading comprehension fail
23:20  mgedmin: I totally missed that when I read :h 'sc' earlier
23:20  miguel000: oh i thought the off does not refer to linux
23:20  miguel000: so everything is fine, SORRY for confusing
23:21  estragib: no, that was quite educative for me, thanks :)
23:21  miguel000: for me too :)
23:27  kenneth_reitz: I'm having a little bit of trouble with a map
23:27  kenneth_reitz: map <F2> :set et\|retab
23:28  kenneth_reitz: when i hit F2, it types `set et\|retab`
23:28  kenneth_reitz: how can i have it execute it?
23:28  fow: kenneth_reitz, :nnoremap <F2> :set et <bar> retab<CR>
23:28  kenneth_reitz: ahh
23:28  kenneth_reitz: let me try that
23:29  kenneth_reitz: yes!
23:29  kenneth_reitz: thank you sir.
23:29  kenneth_reitz: you're awesome.
23:29  kenneth_reitz: fow: one more for ya : )
23:29  kenneth_reitz: nmap <D-/> gcc
23:29  kenneth_reitz: any idea how to get that to work in insert mode?
23:30  fow: imap?
23:30  kenneth_reitz: gcc is a command
23:30  kenneth_reitz: when i do imap it just types 'gcc'
23:32  fow: maybe :inoremap <D-/> <C-o>gcc
23:32  mgedmin: what does 'gcc' do?
23:33  Raimondi: kenneth_reitz: Do you want to run gcc?
23:34  kenneth_reitz: Raimondi: no, that's the nmap command for toggling line comments (comment plugin)
23:34  Raimondi: Oh!
23:34  mgedmin: then you don't want :inoremap, you want :imap
23:37  kenneth_reitz: ahh, <Esc>
23:37  spiiph: People use noremap for all the wrong reasons.
23:37  kenneth_reitz: succes!
23:37  kenneth_reitz: thanks guys
23:44  estragib: spiiph: what are the right and wrong reasons?
23:46  spiiph: The wrong reason is to use it as a default for all your mappings, because you don't understand when and why to use it.
23:46  spiiph: The right reason is when you really want to make sure that no other mapping is called, and you know that this is the result you want.
23:50  estragib: hm. i do use noremap almost exclusively because i couldn't think of a situation where i wouldn't want the builtin actions.
23:51  bairui: it probably is a safe default, as long as you know what the nore part means and know when to not use it. Using map or noremap blindly will both end in grief eventually.
23:52  fow: Oh, my bad. I didn't think about what gcc is.
