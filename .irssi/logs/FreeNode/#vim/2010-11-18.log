09:05  dleary: I recently pressed ctrl-e and didn't know the opposite command (ctrl-y, I know now)
09:05  dleary: so, two questions:
09:06  dleary: is there a way to see which commands were recently run in your current buffer?
09:06  dleary: is there a way to see what command a specific key combo would do?  or a list of all commands?  :map just shows me overridden ones I think?
09:07  DHulme: dleary: :help ctrl-e (or whatever) does it for built-in ones
09:08  DHulme: as for command history, it's only for : commands, and you can see it by pressing q:
09:09  DHulme: (or by pressing : to start a command and then the up arrow to look through recent commands)
09:17  dleary: DHulme: thanks, the :help is good enough for the immediate problem
09:20  elik: DHulme: do you happen to know much about terminals and 256 colors?
09:22  elik: DHulme: I'm trying to sort out a xterm-ssh-screen-some program (vim, irssi, whatever)
09:37  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: sorry, was off for lunch :) I power ubuntu Lucid
09:37  EspadaV8_W: ah, mkay
09:37  EspadaV8_W: just wondering
09:38  EspadaV8_W: currently on a mac and noticed i only have 7.2, trying to upgrade to 7.3 with macports and was having issues
09:38 * EspadaV8_W misses linux
09:38  sharat87: hah, I compiled my own shiny copy of vim 7.3 just a couple of days ago :)
09:40  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: is lucid the latest?
09:40  sharat87: nope, maverick 10.10 is
09:40  sharat87: lucid is 10.04
09:41  EspadaV8_W: ah
09:41  EspadaV8_W: doesn't come with 7.3? i thought ubuntu was up to date
09:41  EspadaV8_W: (mostly)
09:41  sharat87: no, when lucid was released there was no 7.3 :)
09:41  sharat87: they didn't release an update either
09:41  EspadaV8_W: ah
09:42  sharat87: but you know, as scary as it might sound, compiling isn't all too bad, now that I've done it :)
09:42  EspadaV8_W: wow, i just found i can install KDE4 with MacPorts
09:42  sharat87: I can configure what features my vim has :D
09:42  sharat87: oh, am not a kde boy :)
09:43  EspadaV8_W: i used to use gentoo, where you configure everything, got bored of it after a few years and switched to arch
09:43  sharat87: I'd assume compiling these kind of stuff would be easy on mac too, but perhaps you are wanting the MacVim thingy? :)
09:43 * EspadaV8_W <3 rolling releases
09:43  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: i use the terminal mostly, and 10.6 comes with vim 7.2
09:44  sharat87: ah ok
09:44  EspadaV8_W: so trying to get macports set up so i can install 7.3 from it
09:44  EspadaV8_W: macvim is a gui app only :(
09:44  sharat87: I use gvim mainly for support for more colors and the menu :)
09:44  sharat87: and the scrollbars ofcourse ;)
09:45  Raimondi_: EspadaV8_W: MacVim can be used from the terminal too
09:45 --- Raimondi_ is now known as Raimondi
09:46  EspadaV8_W: Raimondi: i thought it just loaded the gui app?
09:46  Raimondi: No, read  :h mvim
09:47  Raimondi: Install the mvim script and create a link named vim that points to it.
09:47  Raimondi: symlink*
09:49  EspadaV8_W: oooooh
09:49  EspadaV8_W: that works
09:49  Raimondi: Nice, eh?
09:51  EspadaV8_W: mhmm
09:52  EspadaV8_W: mv MacVim.app /Applications ; mv mvim ~/bin ; ln -s ~/bin/mvim ~/bin/vim
09:52  EspadaV8_W: :-D
09:52  EspadaV8_W: thanks Raimondi
09:52  FernandoBasso: Can't --remote open in a slplit or a vsplit?
09:52  Raimondi: np :)
09:53  FernandoBasso: Only tabs?
09:56  FernandoBasso: I always forget the darn %:p:h and have to look at the help every time. :/
09:57  EspadaV8_W: woohoo, persistant undo is awesome :-D
09:57  Raimondi: IT's pretty good, have you tried relative line numbers?
09:57  sharat87: FernandoBasso: From my vimrc "nnoremap cd :cd %:p:h<CR>:pwd<CR>" :)
09:57  EspadaV8_W: anyone that uses NERDTree, do you know if it's possible to have it re-open the previous bookmark/view automatically?
09:58  sharat87: Raimondi: what is that?
09:58  sharat87: I've tried conceal :)
09:58  EspadaV8_W: i'm guessing i could use some king of :mkview-fu, just not sure what'd be needed
09:58  Raimondi: It's 7.3 only  :h 'rnu'
09:58  FernandoBasso: sharat87: Nice one!! Indeed. Thanks.
09:58  sharat87: Raimondi: I run 7.3, will check out :)
09:59  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: I don't know how to do that, but I have a mapping to toggle it open and close: (from my vimrc again) "nnoremap <silent> <F4> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>" :)
09:59  EspadaV8_W: lol, rnu is kinda cool, shame you can't have both on
10:00  Raimondi: That's a common complain :)
10:00  EspadaV8_W: yeah, i've mapped that to F2
10:00  sharat87: Raimondi: rnu is awesome!!
10:00  Raimondi: Although I'm learing to rely on my statusline to check the line number...
10:00  Raimondi: learning*
10:00  sharat87: where do I get a list of these features in 7.3, I discovered conceal too by accident
10:01  EspadaV8_W: but, e.g. start of the work day, open vim, F2 to open NT but it's open at my home dir, i then have to re-open whatever i had open yesterday, as well as all the branches in the tree view
10:01  Raimondi: :h 7.3
10:01  sharat87: yeah, rnu is nice but doesn't seem realistic, with the fact that it hides original nos
10:01  sharat87: ah ok
10:01  EspadaV8_W: conceal?
10:01  sharat87: yeah, check it out, not much on its own, but there are some plugins that make goood use of it :)
10:02  EspadaV8_W: atm i only have Project, NT and bclose
10:02  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: you can use the bookmarks to get the directory you need or use sessions, which save the current directory too, which is what I do, but with the sessionman plugin
10:02  denysonique: Hi.
10:03  EspadaV8_W: need to get a nice selection plugins
10:03  denysonique: How can I copy characters from the above line?
10:03  denysonique: I remember a one key for that.
10:03  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: first things first, you need pathogen my friend :)
10:03  denysonique: I remember that this was achievable via one key press.
10:04  strull: denysonique: ctrl-y
10:04  denysonique: strull, sweet, cheers
10:05  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: pathogen?
10:05  sharat87: yeah its a vim plugin
10:05  EspadaV8_W: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen ?
10:05  sharat87: yep
10:06  denysonique: strull, C-y, and ~ are both cool keys, do you know anything similar to those cool keys, I would like to learn some more.
10:06  EspadaV8_W: hmm, not sure i see its usefulness, can't you just put the plugins wherever you want anyway?
10:06  strull: denysonique: sure, my favorite is :he
10:07  denysonique: heh
10:07  denysonique: but that is not similar to those two anyway.
10:07  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: you can, which makes it difficult to add and remove plugins
10:08  denysonique: I prefer helpg btw
10:08  sharat87: especially to remove a plugin
10:08  denysonique: :helpg
10:08  industrial: My indentation for HTML documents, css, Javascript etc is not working
10:08  industrial: I am working in .php files.
10:09  Raimondi: vimgor isn't working
10:09  vimgor: No idea!
10:09  industrial: filetype plugin indent on, syntax on and ft=php on the buffer
10:09  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: i shall install it tomorrow, for now i am off for food :-D
10:09  EspadaV8_W: it's home time
10:09  Raimondi: vimgor doesn't work
10:09  vimgor: What happened? Did it fall asleep on your couch? Eat your homework? Destroy your hard drive? Is it making faces at you? Does it want more money? Is it sleeping with your best friend? Please be specific!
10:09  Raimondi: industrial: ^
10:10  industrial: doesnt work as in when I press enter it goes to column 0 instead of indenting
10:10  industrial: it doesn.t indent.
10:10  industrial: at all.
10:11  sharat87: does 'se ai' change that?
10:11  industrial: Raimondi: the PHP indenting works however
10:11  EspadaV8_W: oh, before i go though, has anyone used the undo branches plugin?
10:11  sharat87: there's a plugin for that?
10:12  sharat87: i thought it was built into vim
10:12  Raimondi: industrial: I supose that's due to the filetype being set to php
10:12  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: oh, it is?
10:12  EspadaV8_W: even more awesome
10:12  EspadaV8_W: saw it some where and thought it looked awesome
10:12  industrial: Raimondi: so any php document will never indent HTML?
10:13  industrial: doesnt vim use the html filetype indentation and syntax rules for HTML parts in PHP documents
10:13  Raimondi: industrial: I don't work with php, sorry.
10:13  industrial: and CSS and Javascript etc?
10:13  Raimondi: Oh! NO, vi doesn't do that, it needs multi-language indent files.
10:14  industrial: why :S
10:14  Raimondi: EspadaV8_W: I preffer gundo
10:14  EspadaV8_W: Raimondi, sharat87, just opened chrome and that's what i had open, gundo
10:15  EspadaV8_W: looks almost like a mini-version control things
10:15  EspadaV8_W: *thiny
10:15  sharat87: oh, I am the only one here not using it eh? trying it now
10:15  industrial: Raimondi: thats kind of redundant rules then isnt it :S
10:15  sharat87: oh gundo requires vim 7.3 sweet :)
10:17  skazhy: Hi! How I can compile the currently opened file with g++?
10:17  remyo: Vim on OS X question: I currently have the vim command aliased to Macvims vim. Is there a way to do this for "sudo vim" as well, which always uses OS X's pre installed Vim
10:17  EspadaV8_W: sharat87: not used it yet, just seen about it
10:18  industrial: remyo: wouldn't you rather use the 'mvim' command supplied with macvim and leave vim 7.2 in place?
10:18  EspadaV8_W: so tomorrow, gundo, sessionman and pathogen
10:18  EspadaV8_W: lots to learn and play with :-)
10:19  Raimondi: remyo: Don't do 'sudo vim' is not safe
10:19  EspadaV8_W: TIL... quitall
10:19  EspadaV8_W: (or just now i learned really)
10:19  EspadaV8_W: ANYWAY... ttfn
10:19  remyo: Raimondi: I know what I'm doing. And every now and then I have to.
10:19  remyo: Mostly for editing the hosts file (adding website aliases and things like that)
10:20  Raimondi: There is sudo -e to do that.
10:20  sharat87: EspadaV8_W: bye bye :)
10:21  Raimondi: remyo: I can't answer your question, I don't use alias, I have symlinks and they work fine with sudo.
10:37  Segaja: hi. is there a color file for logrotate?
10:52  schweizer: hi
10:52  schweizer: how can i delte all lines from the current one to lets say line number 110?
10:52  schweizer: delete

11:03  FernandoBasso: Isn't vim awesome? ☺
11:03  muffinmad: FernandoBasso: it is
11:05  FernandoBasso: :)
11:08  muffinmad: i wish i realy learn vim somehow :)
11:09  FernandoBasso: muffinmad: May I suggest you something?
11:09  the_gamer: how to start editing at the end of a text? "vim foo.txt +G" doesn't work
11:11  muffinmad: FernandoBasso: i think so
11:12  sharat87: the_gamer: try vim foo.txt +$
11:12  sharat87: not sure though
11:13  FernandoBasso: Read one chapter of the help each day, and take notes on what you think you should. Start with usr_01.txt, and keep going. And then, come here, and ask questions, as I do. :D
11:13  Axioplase_: does work
11:13  Axioplase_: I wonder why vim foo.txt --cmd '$' does not.  :$ is a command…
11:14  FernandoBasso: I'm doing that myself. Only, that I don't read one chapter each day, but one chapter each two or three days, as time permits.
11:14  sharat87: not sure, never used vim from terminal that much
11:14  sharat87: FernandoBasso: you have a lot of patience ;)
11:14  FernandoBasso: sharat87: I don't know other way I could learn.
11:15  Axioplase_: vim foo.txt -c $  too works
11:15  FernandoBasso: Of, course, I take a look at the wiki, now an then.
11:15  sharat87: I watch videos, that show me one or two commands, then look em up in :h and from there to another... and on and on :)
11:17  muffinmad: and i'm trying find different ways to do common operations
11:20  muffinmad: i have imap ( ()<LEFT> in .vimrc. and after entering text inside brackets i have to press right arrow
11:20  amcsi: hello
11:20  muffinmad: how can i avoid moving hand to arrow keys?
11:20  sharat87: muffinmad: try delimitMate
11:21  amcsi: how do I disable the filetype plugin for javascript only?
11:21  FernandoBasso: muffinmad: Use autoclose.vim instead.
11:21  muffinmad: thanks, i'll try
11:21  sharat87: amcsi: try "au BufRead,BufNewFile *.js filetype plugin off" or something along those lines, untested
11:22  sharat87: FernandoBasso: yeah, that's what I use too, but it sometimes breaks undo for me, so I don't recommend it :)
11:22  amcsi: thx
11:22  FernandoBasso: sharat87: Okay.
11:23  amcsi: doesn't work, sharat87
11:23  sharat87: amcsi: oh boy, just a sec then
11:24  FernandoBasso: I have never heard of delimitMate.
11:24  sharat87: au FileType javascript filetype plugin off
11:24  amcsi: and it's not the plugin, it's the indent I want off
11:24  sharat87: amcsi: ^
11:24  sharat87: oh yeah, sorry
11:24  sharat87: s/plugin/indent
11:25  sharat87: you want to turn on ai I suppose?
11:25  sharat87: then just "au FileType javascript setlocal ai" should work
11:26  amcsi: none of those worked :/
11:27  the_gamer: sharat87: great, thx
11:28  amcsi: although this may be the source of most of my problems for the javascript filetype indenting: inoremap {<CR>  {<CR>}<Esc>O
11:31  sharat87: that comes from delimitMate I suppose
11:31  sharat87: ok, here's what I think is happening, turning off filetype indent later after the indenting script is executed does not make any difference
11:32  sharat87: you must be having filetype indent on in your vimrc right?
11:32  sharat87: after that you can't turn it off I gues
11:45  djh: Hi all. When I do a regex search, vim hilights the largest possible value - e.g. if I search for "foo.*bar" and there's a line "foo bar and another bar" then the whole line gets highlighted, whereas I would rather just the first two words did. Is this do-able?
11:46  kurkale6ka: djh foo.\{-}bar
11:47  Silex: For those that were interested in the clang_complete vim plugin the other day, here it is https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete. See the wiki for making it work on windows
11:47  amcsi: sharat87: yes, although I think I read in the manual that turning the indent plugin off loads another file that disables it
11:47  djh: kurkale6ka: Much obliged!
11:50  sharat87: amcsi: oh, then I don't know :)
11:51  amcsi: how about turning indenting on for everything, but javascript? :D
11:54  sharat87: ow that can be done, I guess, but I'm not sure how
12:00  amcsi: ah well, thanks anyway
12:00  amcsi: it seems this is a good fix to my problems btw: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1936
12:00  amcsi: vim 7.3 would fix it too, but it's too new and not widespread enough in linux distro repositories
12:03 --- Tricia is now known as Guest91296
12:38  muffinmad: how to insert character at beggining of few lines?
12:38  muffinmad: .,+3 for example
12:39  FernandoBasso: ^vI3jxx<Esc> to insert two x.
12:39  FernandoBasso: Using visual.
12:39  strull: FernandoBasso: reread your hint
12:40  strull: right idea, wrong doing
12:40  FernandoBasso: Hmm. I forgot the I

12:52  bsod1: I downloaded http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=301 this script, and now how can I enable it?
12:53  FernandoBasso: bsod1: Did you drop it in ~.
12:54  FernandoBasso: Oops. in ~/.vim/plugin/ ?
12:55  bsod1: FernandoBasso: no I drop it to /.vim/ftplugin/
12:56  bsod1: FernandoBasso: ok, now it's in /.vim/plugin
12:57  FernandoBasso: bsod1: You were right. The correct place is ftplugin.
12:57  FernandoBasso: Did you restart vim?
12:57  bsod1: FernandoBasso: yes
12:57  FernandoBasso: And, do you have filetype plugin indent on ?
12:58  bsod1: FernandoBasso: yes ..
12:59  FernandoBasso: bsod1: And are you editing an xml file now? Correct? Run :scriptnames and look for the plugin. See if it is being loaded.
13:01  bsod1: FernandoBasso: it must work on html and xml files, I'm editing html right now but it's notloaded
13:02  FernandoBasso: bsod1: What if you do :source ~/.vim/ftplugin/xml.vim ?
13:03  bsod1: FernandoBasso: it's format is .vba, is this a problem?
13:03  bsod1: it's not .vim
13:03  FernandoBasso: bsod1: Or put something like this in ~/.vimrc -> autocmd BufRead *.html set filetype=html.xml.
13:03  FernandoBasso: OH.
13:04  FernandoBasso: bsod1: :edit 'your_vba_file' and do :source %
13:04  bsod1: great, I changed the format from .vba to .vim and it worked :)
13:04  bsod1: weird
13:04  bsod1: why it's format is .vba
13:04  FernandoBasso: bsod1: That is not the correct procedure for dealing with vba files.
13:04  bsod1: FernandoBasso: what is the corrent procedure then?
13:04  FernandoBasso: bsod1: :help vba
13:04  FernandoBasso: bsod1: :edit 'your_vba_file' and do :source %
13:05  kurkale6ka: visual basic for applications
13:05  supe: vim killed my cat. Will bvim bring it back?
13:05  bsod1: FernandoBasso: so I need to install my vba file, right?
13:05  FernandoBasso: Yeah.
13:07  FernandoBasso: bsod1: You *edit* your .vba file, like any other file, just that after that you :source %
13:07  bsod1: FernandoBasso: great, I followed the instructions and installed it

13:07  FernandoBasso: Good! I can feel the dark side on you. :D
13:08  bsod1: FernandoBasso: eheh :)
13:09  supe: What advantage do you see in using vim instead of an IDE, such as CodeBlocks or geany etc.?
13:09  muffinmad: xmledit + delimitMate = double closing '>'
13:10  FernandoBasso: supe: For me, it is the extensibility, regex, customization, manipulation of the source, and the way vim enables us to move around the source code. Just to name a few ones.
13:10  FernandoBasso: Not to mention its community, which is amazing.
13:11  FernandoBasso: Run in almost any platform you may think of. Lightweight...
13:11  FernandoBasso: Edit remotely.
13:11  muffinmad: Keyboard driven!!
13:12  the_isz: supe: also, it's not necessarily 'instead of'. if i really need an IDE (for debugging for instance), i start it parallel to vim, debug in it and keep editing in vim.
13:12  FernandoBasso: No need to graphic interface when you don't have one available, and so one.
13:12  muffinmad: no need to move your hand to mouse and back
13:12  FernandoBasso: muffinmad: Yeah. When I said 'the way it enables us to move arround' it meant 'keyboard driven'.
13:12  supe: hmm
13:12  FernandoBasso: muffinmad: Neither the eveil arrow keys.
13:12  supe: The reason I ask, is that I'm writing an IDE
13:13  muffinmad: supe: what for?
13:13  supe: and trying to see what I can do, if anything, to push vim users onto my IDE
13:13  iaj: the_isz: what program languages are you coding if I may ask?
13:13  FernandoBasso: supe: keybord navigation.
13:13  supe: muffinmad: Still deciding on platform
13:13  supe: FernandoBasso: Like Kate?
13:13  sharat87: I use vim because it makes people who look at it over my should have no idea what the heck I am doing, but the text just magically responds to my wizardry :D

13:14  iaj: sharat87: ^^
13:14  FernandoBasso: supe: NO. LIKE VIM>
13:14  the_isz: iaj: c++ mostly, python sometimes. but i also write everything that's not programming in vim: emails, latex, html, xml, text-fields in firefox, whatever comes along...
13:14  iaj: sharat87: something specifically that's impressing them:)?
13:14  FernandoBasso: supe: Source manipulation and navigation is what keep me away IDEs up to the present time.
13:14  sharat87: iaj: text-objects FTW
13:15  sharat87: believe me, they have absolutely no idea :D
13:15  iaj: the_isz: ahh.. i see.:) cool! was hoping for java...   text-fields in ffox - with itsalltext or vimperator?
13:15  FernandoBasso: IDEs force us to use mouse and arrow keys, <home> <end> and the like. I hate that.
13:15  iaj: sharat87: which motions do you mostly use, heh
13:15  iaj: FernandoBasso: agreed.
13:15  sharat87: iaj: lets see, dib, yib, ViB:sort   <- blows their mind :)
13:16  the_isz: iaj: vimperator. i programmed java in the first years at uni, but i didn't use vim back then. also: you asked me that already two weeks ago :)
13:16  iaj: the_isz: yeah.. that could be.. heh... sorry about that!!   vimp on ff3 or 4?
13:16  the_isz: iaj: 3 i think...
13:17  the_isz: iaj: yep, 3.6
13:17  iaj: the_isz: doh.. was hoping you to use 4... because textfields (c-i) isn't working there properly - at least for me.
13:17  the_isz: iaj: well... probably the vimperator dev hasn't yet adapted it to ff4
13:18  sharat87: and with surround.vim, ys$'ys$b   <- "wait! what did you just do?" :D
13:18  iaj: sharat87: heh... ViB:sort indeed scares some :)
13:19  iaj: sharat87: while we'r at it can one drop the (_ space of surrounding in that case?
13:19  Silex: FernandoBasso: you use hjkl much?
13:19  sharat87: If I ever switch to another editor from vim, either my company forces me into it, or that editor has vim emulation along with VimL interpretation :D
13:20  FernandoBasso: Not much. More F, f, T, t and the like.
13:20  sharat87: iaj: didn't get you
13:20  iaj: sharat87: ys$b for example is dropping a ( blafoo )  if there was blafoo on the line - i want it to (blafoo) however.
13:20  Silex: FernandoBasso: me too, but sometimes when I want to quickly edit close stuffs, like erase one char there and same for line under, I use the arrows keys
13:21  iaj: Silex: lose that habit :)
13:21  Silex: for example I go fX to find the char, then x<Down>x
13:21  sqz: ohoh..lets not start a hjkl vs arrow keys rant
13:21  sharat87: iaj: It doesn't put spaces for me? in fact using ys$( puts a space and ys$) does not, using b doesn't at least for me :)
13:21  iaj: fXxjx would be faster over time Silex ;)
13:21  FernandoBasso: Silex: Please, drop that habit.
13:21  sqz: lets start a 'using hjkl and arrow keys in harmony' conversation instead!
13:21  muffinmad: to use vim you need to change the way you thinking
13:22  Silex: iaj: well you're advicing for hjkl
13:22  muffinmad: editing with vim it's like mediatation :0
13:22  muffinmad: :)
13:22  Silex: FernandoBasso: so when you also use hjkl?
13:22  Silex: s/when//
13:23  sharat87: for very fine control over motion
13:23  sharat87: don't need it very often
13:23  FernandoBasso: Silex: When I want to move no more than 2 or 3 chars to the left/right or no more than 2 or 3 lines up/down.
13:23  iaj: sharat87: really? ) ain't putting a <SP> but b does... strange.
13:23  Silex: FernandoBasso: yes, that happens quite often
13:23  FernandoBasso: Silex: I agree.
13:24  sharat87: iaj: try with )
13:24  Silex: and how do you do it when, in insert mode, you need to quickly navigate 2-3 chars left/right? you <Esc>jji etc?
13:24  iaj: sharat87: working as expected, just curious why b doesn't.. in surround.txt doc its said to work the same as )
13:25  FernandoBasso: Silex: I do that.
13:25  sharat87: iaj: may be you have a "onoremap ib i(" or something like that :D
13:25  sharat87: don't know
13:25  iaj: sharat87: do you have something like that specified?
13:25  iaj: ;-)
13:25  Silex: I mean, for those who use fFtT/? very often, the argument against arrow keys is because you have to move your hand to the arrow keys instead of keeping them on the keyboard central line?
13:26  sharat87: nope
13:26  Silex: and basically if you get used to hjkl you are then even faster?
13:27  FernandoBasso: Silex: Yes.
13:27  Silex: okay, thanks for clarifying
13:27  FernandoBasso: Vim is all about fast editing and DRY.
13:27  Silex: I'm really close to that
13:28  Silex: just the arrow keys I sometimes jump to in insert mode
13:28  FernandoBasso: Of course, this fast editing takes some time. But it pays.
13:28  Silex: because I don't like having to exit insert mode to press two keys to enter it again
13:28  FernandoBasso: Silex: To edit, sometimes you don't even need to be in INSERT mode.
13:29  FernandoBasso: Sometimes you just want to r, or R, or x or 3x etc...
13:29  Silex: yeah sure
13:29  Silex: or use a visual block with beginining/end insertion
13:29  iaj: Silex: i started like that at first too.. but i suggest you imap the arrow keys to something like echo 'use hjkl instead ;)' in order to drop that behaviour
13:29  Silex: or a macro...
13:32  FernandoBasso: Or make code right on the first time so that you don't need to edit it. :D
13:32  iaj: FernandoBasso: easy:)
13:33  FernandoBasso: Indeed.
13:33  Silex: it's just that sometimes you have like 3 lines to fix, they're not consistent, writing a macro would be too much work, and going the cwkeke<Esc>jifoo<Esc>jibar is much more work than cwkeke<down>foo<down>bar
13:34  iaj: how can I have a certain macro stored in a certain register for a certain filetype? au Filetype (...) let @a = yyp   for example
13:34  iaj: s/$/?/
13:34  FernandoBasso: Using vim the right way, even when at first it takes more time, is what makes us learn to the point when we 'fly' on the keyboard.
13:34  iaj: FernandoBasso: while we'r at it.. do you know some nice videos showing vim-gurus?
13:34  Silex: I see
13:35  getxsick: hi there
13:37  FernandoBasso: iaj: I like Derek Wyatt (if I spell correctly)
13:37  FernandoBasso: getxsick: Hi.
13:37  getxsick: can i set tab to make flexible tabs? i mean i would like to tab up to the next ident
13:37  iaj: FernandoBasso: know all of him already:) yeah. correctly
13:39  supe: The thing that I hate about vim is I open a file, ie; vim ./mytext.py, and I start typing, and nothing shows up on the screen. FML
13:39  supe: WTF
13:40  FernandoBasso: supe: Hit i and *then* you are ready to type.
13:40  the_isz: Silex: i assume you have caps lock mapped to esc? because if you're using the regular esc button i could see why you think pressing it takes much time...
13:40  FernandoBasso: When you are done typing, hit <Esc>
13:40  Silex: the_isz: no I use the regular esc... I guess I'll try mapping it to capslock
13:40  the_isz: Silex: that'll speed editing in vim up a lot
13:41 * Silex is still a young padawan
13:41  FernandoBasso: supe: Moreover, impossible to use vim without reading a little about. Start with vimtutor.
13:41  the_isz: Silex: and don't try to map it inside vim. this mapping is OS stuff
13:41  supe: FernandoBasso: vimtutor?
13:41 * supe is an avid nano user
13:42  FernandoBasso: supe: Yeah. type that in a terminal.
13:42  Silex: the_isz: ah, hum, err
13:42 * Silex googles
13:42  the_isz: Silex: what OS are you on?
13:43  Silex: the_isz: unbutu, OSX and windows
13:43  Silex: I have my vim config inside a dropbox and only ln -s .vimrc ~/Dropbox/.vimrc
13:44  the_isz: Silex: ok, check the vim wiki then. for linux you'll use xmodmap, for windows you'll need a little registry modification. both are explained in the wiki.
13:44  Silex: alright, thanks
13:44  the_isz: Silex: i don't know about osx, but guess xmodmap might do its work there, too.
13:44  iaj: someone using xptemplate?  Im trying to set xpttemplate_vars but something is going wrong.. if I first set 'let xpttemplate_vars =' and the next line 'let xpttemplate_vars += ...'  that should work correct?
13:44  the_isz: is osx using the x-server?
13:47  supe: FernandoBasso: Is there an online, printable version?
13:51  Silex: supe: googling for "vim tutorial" gives a lot of results
13:51  Silex: just follow one of those, then another one, the use :h a lot, and eventually it'll click
13:53  supe: ./usr/share/vim/vim73/tutor/tutor
13:53  dindinx: supe: just use the vimtutor command
13:54  supe: http://pastebin.com/F3DCxBmH
13:55  supe: Holy crap, that's 38 pages
13:56  dindinx: supe: this is an interactive tutorial, it doesn't have pages.
13:56  supe: and the last two pages are saying that you should read the book
13:56  Silex: ah, <CTRLl-C> is a good alternative for <Esc>
13:56  Silex: and no need to remap capslock or esc
13:57  Silex: s/Ll/L/
13:57  dindinx: supe: please start at the beginning, not at the end. And please _follow_ the tutorial.
13:57  iaj: gnaa.. someone using XPTTemplate?
13:58  getxsick: so, is it possible to set flexible tab width?
14:03 * Silex just realised the power of not having to move to esc or the arrows... it's overwhelming... cannot cope with so much efficientness
14:05  Ebrahem: I keep getting E492: Not an editor command: ^M even though I can't see the dos newline in neither pico, gedit, nor vi. I am running ubuntu atm
14:07  Ebrahem: Anyone?
14:08  muffinmad: Ebrahem: what are you trying to do?
14:08  Silex: Ebrahem: where, what, how?
14:08  Ebrahem: In so many files, while starting up vim. I copy around my files from/to windows/mac and now trying them in ubuntu
14:09  Ebrahem: even in .vimrc
14:12  supe: Are there any advantages/disadvantages to using emacs instead of vim?
14:13  telemachus: supe: Many people like org mode (sp?)
14:13  Ebrahem: Silex, do you know how to replace all the ^M's to vim compatible newline in a file? %, s/^M/\r/g does not work
14:14  telemachus: supe: And I suppose if you are a Lisper already....
14:14  muffinmad: supe: girls can't use emacs
14:14  iaj: how can I vim to match the xpttemplate personal path when using pathogen - that seems to be a mistery
14:14  telemachus: You might also try #emacs for that question, though :)
14:14  Juri_Agarin: Ebrahem: use dos2unix <filename>
14:16  Ebrahem: su basically find . -type f -exec dos2unix {} \; right?
14:16  kurkale6ka: Ebrahem: just :se ft=unix and save
14:16  Juri_Agarin: Ebrahem: yeah, something like that. (can't remember the find-syntax..)
14:17  Juri_Agarin: But beware if you have non-text files there, I'm not sure if dos2unix notices that?
14:18  Ebrahem: I can use -name "*.vim"
14:18  supe: Ebrahem: Or ls *.vim -R?
14:18  supe: xD
14:19  supe: Oh, he's using an exec
14:20  Juri_Agarin: Ebrahem: if you want to have the same plugins etc. on different machines, you could consider putting them to a (git-)repository and keeping them up to date on all machines by that. Then you could also set the line-endings to be correct automatically.
14:21  Silex: Ebrahem: :%s/\r//g removes the cariage returns and only let the \n in there
14:22  Silex: Ebrahem: I put my vim plugins/config into dropbox and then I simply ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/DropBox/vim/.vimrc
14:22  supe: Wow, emacs and vi were both created in 1976
14:23  Silex: muffinmad: what with girls and emacs?
14:23  dindinx: (sorry, didn't see supe was just a troll)
14:23  supe: It makes them hot
14:23  supe: :P
14:24 * supe is procrastinating for an Exam tomorrow
14:24  muffinmad: Silex: they can't use it. because some of commands invoked by pressing 21 keys at once
14:24  muffinmad: :)
14:24  supe: I'm looking for a solution which will provide: Syntax-highlighting, auto-indentation, code-completion and a simple command to compile. Is vim the solution?
14:24  Silex: muffinmad: lol
14:24  muffinmad: supe: yes it is
14:25  dindinx: muffinmad: don't feed it.
14:25  supe: dindinx: Om nom nom
14:25  supe: muffinmad: Thanks
14:26  Ebrahem: none of the stuff works, not the %s/\r//g, not dos2unix (i got not a regular file) and not even :set ft=unix (and then save)
14:27  Silex: Ebrahem: when does that message about ^M appear?
14:28  Juri_Agarin: Ebrahem: weird, what file was it? Did you try "raw" without the find-command?
14:28  Ebrahem: Silex, when I startup vim and having a .vimrc (the one brought from windows). I don't get anything if it is a plain .vimrc file
14:29  Ebrahem: Juri_Agarin, I only tried the direct command first on one file but didn't work with .vimrc
14:29  Silex: Ebrahem: so, answer my question?
14:29  Ebrahem: Silex, I did :)
14:29  Ebrahem: Silex, upon starting up vim
14:30  Silex: ok
14:30  muffinmad: Ebrahem: than open .vimrc, move cursor under ^M, :%s/<c-r><c-w>//g
14:30  Silex: does :messages tells you from which file it is?
14:30  dindinx: vimgor: eol
14:30  muffinmad: Ebrahem: and save
14:30  vimgor: Dunno!
14:30  dindinx: vimgor: line endings
14:30  vimgor: I have no idea, dindinx.
14:30  Ebrahem: muffinmad, I see no ^M at all, this is the problem
14:30  Juri_Agarin: Does catting etc. work with that file?
14:30  Silex: I think it's coming from another file
14:30  thesteo82: hey guys, if i do :ls to show current buffers, is there a way to make that only return filenames, and not full paths
14:30  dindinx: damn! There was a factoid about this.
14:30  Ebrahem: Juri_Agarin, cat does not show any ^M
14:31  muffinmad: Ebrahem: so that's no vimrc
14:31  muffinmad: Ebrahem: maybe it's some plugin
14:31  Ebrahem: Silex, how come when I do "mv .vimrc .vimrc2" no error comes up?
14:31  Silex: Ebrahem: because your vimrc sources another file
14:32  Silex: or because your vimrc is broken
14:32  Ebrahem: Silex, my vimrc does source some other files but the indicition is way at the top. let be pastebin some stuff
14:32  Silex: find which file it complains about the ^M, I think :messages can show, maybe :debug too
14:32  iaj: someone here who's sticking to XPTemplate?!  I could need some help
14:32  Silex: or :verbose
14:33  muffinmad: Ebrahem: comment out entire vimrc and uncomment line by line to find out
14:33  Silex: there has to be a better way
14:33  Ebrahem: Is it fine to paste 4 lines here?
14:33  muffinmad: vimrc review it's always good :)
14:33  dindinx: Ebrahem: I bet on a colorscheme file.
14:37  Ebrahem: http://pastebin.com/qf2Z2LJj
14:39 --- Silex is now known as silex
14:41  Ebrahem: any idea?
14:43  muffinmad: Ebrahem:
14:44  muffinmad: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/File_format
14:46  muffinmad: ...and than i ask "vim eol" to google, brothers and sisters and... google answers me! hallelujah
14:46  iaj: is there some way to text-object a link?!
14:46  iaj: http://foo123123.dba.da/fasdfj/foo.php for example... select all the stuff even if its surrounded by ""'s? 
14:48  the_isz: iaj: well, if it's surrounded by ",  vi"  will do the trick
14:55  Ebrahem: thanks muffinmad, that fixes my current file. Now time to figure out a way to fix them all
14:55  muffinmad: Ebrahem: good luck :)
15:13  kurkale6ka: iaj also viW ?
15:29  iaj: kurkale6ka: that viW won't work when theres something like =http://foofoo.bar :\
15:30  kurkale6ka: iaj: it will. it is capital w
15:34  the_isz: kurkale6ka: well, it will select the = as well, then
15:34  kurkale6ka: the_isz: it will yes
15:35  kurkale6ka: oh I see he wants everithing, part of the url only
15:35  kurkale6ka: maybe a regex then?
15:35  the_isz: iaj: there is no text object for urls. in fact, it's even difficult to define a regular expression for them. so your best bet is either viW - as kurkale6ka suggested - or vi" if it's surrounded by ".
15:38  iaj: or fh.. then W and f to the last bit of it manually I guess
15:40  kurkale6ka: iaj: you know about :h v_o I guess...
15:40  kurkale6ka: just to help trim the selected area
15:43  iaj: kurkale6ka: thanks I'm not bugging so much with visualmode actually - trying to avoid it
15:43  kurkale6ka: it can be rally usefull though
15:44  bsod1: what is vim equivalent of CTRL + backspace in edit mode?
15:44  spiiph: bsod1, <C-w>
15:45  bsod1: spiiph: thanks, and can I undo in edit mode=?
15:46  spiiph: No
15:46  kurkale6ka: <esc>u
15:46  bsod1: <esc> u i
15:46  bsod1: :(
15:46  Ebrahem: can I do "setlocal ff=unix" and "w!" in 1 line?
15:46  iaj: or <C-o>u
15:46  iaj: won't that work as well
15:47  Ogion: au BufWritePost /tmp/xclipboardvim :%y *  can someone tell me why this doesn't work correctly? (there might just be some obvious mistake i'm not seeing)
15:49  strull: Ogion: maybe the space before the *
15:50  Ogion: no, it works with and without space it seems, i mean when i do it manually, as the autocmd it doesn'T seem to change what it does
15:51  Ogion: i noticed though, that when i open that file, write a word, then save two times right after eahc other, then it copies to the clipboard (what %y* should do)
15:51  the_isz: iaj: going into insert mode, inputting text and exiting insert mode is seen as one action by vim's undo mechanism. i wouldn't know how for vim to interpret  <C-o>u
15:51  Ogion: but when i only :w once it doesn't work (:wq doesn't work even after a first :w)
15:52  bsod1: what is the vim equivalent of ctrl + arrow keys in edit mode?
15:53  iaj: the_isz: ohh.. your right.. never thought about that... 
15:54  the_isz: bsod1: please stop asking these questions. insert mode is there to insert text. nothing more, nothing less. trying to make vim's insert mode like any other text editor is an exersise in futulity, if i may borrow the formulation...
15:55  bosie: how do i open a file by searching for a pattern in the filename with vim?
15:55  Ogion: ok, weird, it might be some problem with this method in conjunction with parcellite (a clipboard manager) (without parcellite it seems to work correctly..)
15:55  bsod1: the_isz: what is futulity o_O
15:55  bosie: *pattern* ?
15:56  the_isz: bsod1: futility :)
15:56  the_isz: bsod1: typo...
15:57  spiiph: the_isz, I'm pretty sure that <C-o> creates an undo point.
15:58  elik: I'm trying to get vim to use 256 in xterm->ssh->screen, but so far, I'm having with xterm alone... any term master here?
15:58  spiiph: bsod1, CTRL+arrow keys should work in Vim as well, but it's better if you don't move around in insert mode at all.
15:58  spiiph: elik, xterm-256color and screen-256color terminfos
15:59  elik: spiiph: yeah, I read a bit on terminfo yesterday, but I hardly got anything out of it :S
15:59  spiiph: elik, what's your $TERM in xterm?
15:59  elik: spiiph: plus, the few scripts I downloaded worked fine, but vim's syntax/colortest.vim misses som colors
16:00  elik: spiiph: freshly spawned, "xterm"
16:00  Ebrahem: How do I change/update $VIM variable?
16:00  Ebrahem: oh it is a system thingie, not a vim.. sorry
16:00  spiiph: elik, It should read xterm-256color. Edit your .Xresources or .Xdefaults to include XTerm.termName: xterm-256color
16:01  spiiph: Ebrahem, you shouldn't change $VIM
16:01  strull: Ebrahem: you shouldn't have to anyway
16:01  elik: spiiph: is that the same as trying to set it manually?
16:01  elik: spiiph: I mean, I tried to set manually and it didn't change anything
16:02  spiiph: The results should be the same, but you might have to execute a hard reset after setting it manually. You should set it in a configuration file.
16:02  elik: spiiph: hard reset?
16:02  spiiph: Full reset, rather. Ctrl+Middle Click->Full Reset
16:03  elik: spiiph: I had read that .Xresources tip from http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim, but I got a bit confused with the second comment
16:03  spiiph: Anyway, you should still see the colours correctly.
16:03  elik: spiiph: I see most of them, but some are not
16:03  elik: in the light colors, especially
16:03  spiiph: Well, that tip is wrong. You shouldn't set t_Co
16:04  elik: yeah, I knew about the tip, but the second comment
16:04  spiiph: And you shouldn't set $TERM in .profile
16:04  spiiph: right
16:04  elik: right
16:06  spiiph: Well, some of that is necessary for gnome-terminal/konsole/aterm/eterm, but it's not necessary for xterm.
16:08  bosie: if in the documentation a word is red, can i follow it somehow? is it linked to another doc/part?
16:08  the_isz: iaj: spiiph is right. it seems vim undoes the input up to the <c-o> if you use <c-o>u.
16:08  starlays: hello to all
16:08  spiiph: If your main interest is in using xterm, then my comment is the one you should follow.
16:08  the_isz: bosie: <c-]>
16:08  spiiph: bosie, we can't know that, since it depends on your colour scheme.
16:08  elik: spiiph: even with Xterm*termName in .Xdefaults, $term stays xterm
16:08  spiiph: Did you do xrdb -merge ?
16:08  bosie: the_isz: ok, that doesn't do anything. than i guess it is the color scheme as spiiph says
16:09  spiiph: Err, xrdb -merge .Xdefaults
16:09  starlays: i have a problem, i`m using gvim on windows, and i can`t make block comment, can someone help me?
16:09  elik: spiiph: hum, nope, thought it was sourced a bit like .profile or the likes
16:09  spiiph: bosie, could be spelling, if you have 'spell' set
16:09  elik: spiiph: you have to do that with .Xressources too?
16:09  bosie: spiiph: no i haven't
16:09  spiiph: elik, yes
16:10 --- aksr is now known as aksr|away
16:10  elik: spiiph: starting a new console gave me right $TERM, but full reset didn't seem to be enough
16:12 --- aksr|away is now known as aksr
16:12  elik: spiiph: cool, now the lightyellow, lightcyan and such appear correctly, although very faint
16:13  spiiph: You could run the xterm colour test script to see if everything is OK.
16:13  bosie: i am reading the doc of vim-r and they are referencing <LocalLeader>. is this the same as mapleader?
16:13  elik: spiiph: well, that's the thing. Outside of vim, that test was fine even with just $TERM
16:14  bosie: i am asking because i always thought it is and for some reason vim-r uses the default leader...
16:14  spiiph: bosie, did you try :h <LocalLeader> :P
16:15 --- aksr is now known as hi
16:15  bosie: ah no
16:15 --- hi is now known as dracul
16:16 --- dracul is now known as aksr
16:16  bosie: sometimes, i still forget that vim explains every little variable
16:16  iaj:  what's the best way to surround the currently visual selected area with [foobar]  [/foobar]
16:17  elik: spiiph: even with term xterm-256color, screen sets the term to screen and not screen-256color
16:17  Zathrus: iaj: use the surround plugin
16:18  spiiph: elik, yes, you have to add a setting to your .screenrc.
16:18  Zathrus: elik: that's configurable by screen
16:18  spiiph: elik, see the 'term' option in man term
16:18  spiiph: Err, man screen
16:18  elik: spiiph: and that would explain with light colors appear as bold
16:19  iaj: Zathrus: if I use the surround plugin and type [ it gets automatically surrounded with [   ]
16:19  iaj: but I want it to be [foobar] [/foobar]
16:20  spiiph: iaj, you'll have to create your own surround mapping. It's described in the help.
16:24  iaj: spiiph: ahh... ok..
16:27  iaj: Thanks!
16:28  iaj: but that wouldn't be able to achieve to have the current highlighted url to result in [URL-TRACKING "$URL"] [/URL-TRACKING]?
16:29  kurkale6ka: iaj: give <foobar as the requested text
16:29  elik: spiiph: cool, everything seems fine now
16:29  elik: spiiph: but, erm, why isn't all of that detected automatically?
16:29  iaj: kurkale6ka: yeah but I need foobar to be enclosed by [ not by <
16:30  elik: spiiph: and more generally, do you know of a good place to read about that (terminal initialisation, termcap/terminfo)?
16:30  kurkale6ka: iaj: my bad sorry
16:30  heoa: reading huge columnized junk of data, what was the command not to allow line-breaks so columns are correct?
16:30  spiiph: elik, no, I've never found a place. It's all black magic.
16:30  elik: spiiph: :(
16:31  muffinmad: heoa: set nowrap
16:32  iaj: kurkale6ka: nevermind :-) figured it out
16:32  heoa: muffinmad: thank you.
16:32  elik: I hate magic
16:39  miguel001: how can I enter a LINEBREAK whithin a substitue command
16:39  miguel001: i want to replace all commas with linebraeks
16:39  elik: miguel001: :s/\r
16:40  elik: miguel001: and not :s/\n
16:46  miguel001: thanks
16:52  iaj: someone using vimperator in here by chance :)?
16:54  Zathrus: there's a #vimperator
16:54  tmr: Zathrus, that would be even more biased channel for that poll.
16:55  elik: tmr: :)
16:55  Zathrus: I'd presume there was an actual question behind the pointless poll
17:02  iaj: Zathrus: I know - I actually asked there some time ago
17:06  Alumin: is it possible to use a configuration variable in a key mapping?
17:06  Alumin: nmap <C-i> {!}par $textwidth<CR>     <--- something like that
17:09  spiiph: :h :execute
17:09  spiiph: Also note that by mapping <C-i> you also map <Tab>
17:11  Alumin: yup, that's the idea :)
17:11  Alumin: thanks for the tip, lemme see if I can get that to work
17:12  mr_mustard: how do I find all function declarations, that are not preceded by "public"? I was trying: "\([^c]\) function", but the blank space is not considered... if I get out the blank space, it finds " function"... \s doesn't work in the place of the blank space, too
17:19  Alumin: spiiph: this is what I'm trying, but it's not working:   nmap <C-i> execute "!par " textwidth
17:19  Alumin: when I hit tab, it deletes the last letter of the second word in front of the cursor :)
17:20  spiiph: You need a . for the string concatenation
17:20  spiiph: And you need :execute, since it's an nmap
17:21  Alumin: oh.  I wondered about that, but the manual didn't have the . so I kinda went with it (I did try with :execute as well)
17:21  Alumin: ok, take two!
17:21 * strull is not so sure for the .
17:21  spiiph: No, it might not be necessary
17:21  spiiph: I'd include it anyway, though
17:22  spiiph: Oh, and you need &textwidth, unless you have a global variable called textwidth
17:22  Alumin: aha!  that did it (the '&')
17:30  Alumin: ok, so now I have: nmap <C-i> :execute "!par w" . &textwidth . "<CR>"
17:30 --- Araxia_ is now known as Araxia
17:31  Alumin: and when I try to run it, I get: E114: Missing quote: "         and          E15: Invalid expression: "
17:31  Alumin: I tried putting a backslash in front of the < but that didn't help
17:32  abstrakt: if I forget to sudo vim /root/some-file.txt and then make a bunch of changes
17:33  abstrakt: is there a good/easy way to still be able to save that file from within vim instead of having to quit and start over?
17:33  Alumin: you can use ":w newfile" to write it somewhere else
17:33  Alumin: then copy it over
17:33  spiiph: :w !sudo tee % >/dev/null
17:33  abstrakt: Alumin: but aside from that
17:34  abstrakt: spiiph: hmm... so that does work... someone just showed me that but I didn't think that was valid
17:34  Alumin: ooh that's clever
17:34  abstrakt: spiiph: and why the output into /dev/null
17:34  abstrakt: and what's the %
17:34  spiiph: What do you need it on stdout for?
17:34  Alumin: abstrakt: because you only want the stdout
17:34  spiiph: :h :_%
17:34  abstrakt: I assume % is the current filename?
17:35  Alumin: er you only want the disk file and not the stdout I mean
17:35  graywh: tee duplicates stding to a file and stdout
17:35  graywh: s/g//
17:35  strull: this gives sting then
17:36  graywh: strull cannot read
17:36 * strull can read, but cannot :s
17:36  ReinH: man tee
17:36  graywh: hehe
17:37  ReinH: tee stdout from vim to the file, send stdout of tee to /dev/null
17:38  graywh: and if using vim 7.2 or newer, you probably want :set nomodified afterward
17:39  abstrakt: graywh: ahh, got it
17:43 --- bsod1_ is now known as bsod1
17:46  peth: why not just :w !sudo cat >% ?
17:47  elik: Isn't there a sudoedit anyway?
17:47  graywh: there is
17:47  graywh: sudo -e also works
17:47  graywh: and you should never run vim as root
17:47  strull: sudoedit is for cowards
17:48  gagiel: hen i'm using vim under ubuntu 10.04.1 my new thinkpad, vim often jumps 3 lines up when i am typing. And I don't meet this situation when using emacs or gedit. what can i do to debug this? I'm sure i am not touching the red point of the thinkpad...

18:44  telmich: when I start vim afile it says converted and displays utf-8 incorrectly, cat on the shell works fine; the file is from a mac, has LF insiden (no CR!), I'm on Linux; any idea on what may be wrong here?
18:45 --- Channel #vim was synced in 73 seconds
18:49  spiiph: telmich, what does :set fileformats? say?
18:50  telmich: fileformats=unix,dos
18:50  telmich: I've just found a piece of code that "fixes" the situation (which I don't understand currently), :e ++enc=<what_was_really_needed> %:p
18:51  spiiph: Right, that forces the encoding to the specified value upon reading it.
18:52  telmich: if I do e ++enc=utf8 %:p, it says "[ILLEGAL BYTE in line 5] 8L, 798C"
18:53  spiiph: Then the file is probably not valid utf8
19:04  aborticide: how can i delete all text in an hml file except one that matches a certain string which can accept wildchars?
19:04  aborticide: for example delete all text not having http://*.com*.mp3 , as separated by spaces, tabs, or newlines
19:05  elik: aborticide: grep would probably be a better choice
19:05  Alumin: yeah, run the file through "grep -o"
19:06  kenichi: aka how can i scrape all the songs off some poor fool's site? :)
19:07  aborticide: i have the direct links, so your arguement is invalid
19:07  aborticide: and they're not songs
19:08  kenichi: jeez relax, the smile means i was joking around
19:08  aborticide: sometimes the smile means 'fuck you'
19:11  aborticide: the problem with grep is it will match the entire line, not just the search query
19:11 --- creidiki_ is now known as creidiki
19:14  bsod1_: I have to code java c and cpp because of my school assignments and classes, do you have any advices useing vim for java, c and cpp editor? I tried eclim but failed..
19:16  Alumin: aborticide: then you need a better regexp
