00:47  cagdas: how do we highlight a line
00:47  cagdas: viw for words
00:47  cagdas: vis for sentence
00:47  cagdas: is there something to highlight a line?
00:49  okayzed: cagdas, V ?
00:49  jamessan: 0v$ if you want character-wise instead of line-wise
00:50  cagdas: V is kinda
00:50  okayzed: a line is not really a text object, while the sentence and word are
00:50  cagdas: but I get it
00:50  cagdas: thanks
00:50  okayzed: a line is more a spatial motion
00:51  cagdas: I see

01:30  homekevin: So Vim has a lot of builtin magic for xterms, but it doesn't include GNOME terminal as an xterm. Do you guys think this should be changed?
01:30  homekevin: At least I think there could be a built-in termcap for GNOME terminal.
01:32  sir_lewk: what do you mean?
01:32  sir_lewk: and terminfo is used now instead of termcap
01:32  homekevin: sir_lewk: Vim uses "termcap" terminology.
01:33  homekevin: Is there some particular part I can clarify for you?
01:33  jamessan: homekevin: gnome-terminal should stop claiming to be xterm when it doesn't fully implement xterm's behavior.  you're better off setting $TERM=gnome (or gnome-256color as appropriate) under gnome-terminal
01:33  sir_lewk: ah
01:34  sir_lewk: what kind of stuff doesn't it do, that is user-facing?
01:34  homekevin: jamessan: Totally.
01:34  sir_lewk: (I just use straight-up xterm, so I haven't noticed ;)
01:34  jamessan: sir_lewk: well, terminfo capabilities aren't very user-facing. so according to that qualification, nothing :)
01:35  sir_lewk: well, arn't some mouse capapbilities defined in terminfo?
01:35  homekevin: I kind of broke my keyboard, forgive me if I don't respond for a bit.
01:35  sir_lewk: *shrug*
01:37  jamessan: homekevin: btw, there's been an upstream bug (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115750) against gnome-terminal about the crappy $TERM situation for over 7 years :)
01:38  sir_lewk: I think that link is broken
01:38  homekevin: Bear in mind, Vim fixes up xterm a bunch also.
01:38  homekevin: I was puzzling over why Function keys magically work right in xterm, and that's why.
01:39  sir_lewk: huh, gnomes bugzilla is just down
01:39  jamessan: sir_lewk: it worked for me
01:39  homekevin: Function keys aren't ever properly supported in terminfo
01:39  sir_lewk: 403's for me
01:40  jamessan: sir_lewk: did you accidentally include the ) on the end?
01:40  sir_lewk: and bugzilla.gnome.org gives me a RHEL apache test page
01:40  sir_lewk: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115750 and firefox thinks the ssl cert is fine
01:40  sir_lewk: weird
01:40  homekevin: Huh, I'm not getting any of that sir_lewk.
01:41  sir_lewk: weird, it works from elinks on this host
01:42  homekevin: Must be a virus
01:43  jamessan: heh
01:43 * homekevin is thinking like a Windows user
01:43  homekevin: Better reformat. Or buy a new computer.
01:45  sir_lewk: this is offtopic, but would somebody mind pasting the correct cert for bugzilla.gnome.org somewhere?
01:45  sir_lewk: you can export it from firefox by going to the certificate 'details' tab
01:47  homekevin: sir_lewk: It's a bunch of base64. Is that what you want?
01:47  sir_lewk: yeah, if you don't mind
01:47  strull: jamessan: would you adjust the topic to 7.3.81 ?

01:50  sir_lewk: nice, certs are different
01:54  homekevin: Does vimdiff work on Windows? I think I read that it relies on GNU diff.
01:55  jerojasro: not sure, I think it does
01:55  jerojasro: homekevin: can't you just try it?
01:55  jamessan: homekevin: it does if you have diff (or something else that produces the right output)
01:55  homekevin: jerojasro: Not without Windows.
01:55  jamessan: which is why Vim ships a diff.exe in its install, iirc
01:57  strull: yes, vimdiff should work out of the box (even on windows)
01:57  strull: not as nice as on linux though
01:57  sir_lewk: thanks
01:57  homekevin: strull: Really? In what way is it less nice?
01:58  strull: it will shortly open a dos-box for each :diffupdate or alike
01:58  homekevin: Oh, yeah.
01:58  homekevin: Yuck.
01:58  strull: and of course, it is not as fast
01:58  jamessan: although, wasn't there a patch to fix that behavior recently?
01:59  strull: don't know
01:59  strull: not even sure if it's technically possible
02:00  homekevin: Wow. I was wondering what the "debug" builtin terminal does, so I tried it.
02:01  homekevin: Now some crazy stuff is happening.
02:02  sjl: Hmm, anyone know why running "normal j" in a script would appear to do nothing?
02:02  jamessan: strull: http://mid.gmane.org/AANLkTimhAirPgZPDstVDOny+e8b+Kz0YzO_X0FT8ahnU@mail.gmail.com
02:03  homekevin: sjl: You are on the last line
02:03  sjl: homekevin: Nope, not the case
02:03  jamessan: sjl: btw, you should use "normal! j" to be safe in case j is mapped to something else
02:03  sjl: jamessan: In this case it is, and I WANT the mapping to run
02:03  jamessan: ah
02:03  sjl: (I'm writing unit tests for my Vim plugin)
02:04  sjl: And I'm trying to tests that "j" does what it should in this special window.
02:04  strull: jamessan: I think this patch does avoid the dos-box, it only avoids, that vim looses focus after the box closes
02:05  jamessan: strull: it avoids losing focus while the box is open
02:05  jamessan: since right now the focus switches
02:05  strull: jamessan: yes, but the box still opens
02:05  strull: sjl: could be lazyredraw-issue
02:05  jamessan: true
02:06  jamessan: sjl: are you sure the mapping is active?
02:07  iaj: gna is someone making use of location lists?
02:07  sjl: jamessan: Pretty sure.  is there a way to do something like ":echo (:map j)"?
02:07  sjl: (I'm fairly new to vimscript
02:08  sjl: jamessan:  Just trying to make some unit tests for http://sjl.bitbucket.org/gundo.vim/ so it doesn't eat anyone's data
02:08  jamessan: sjl: :echo maparg('j', 'n')
02:08  strull: sjl: just :map j should echo the mapping
02:08  sjl: jamessan: Yep, it's active -- :call <SNR>4_GundoMove(1)<CR>
02:09  iaj: if someone is using locationlist... what command should bring me to the next place in location-list? thought its :ln but it isn't:(
02:09  jamessan: iaj: are you sure it's a location list and not a quickfix list? are you in the same window as the location list is local to?
02:10  sjl: echo getline('.') ; normal j ; echo getline('.')   -- that doesn't seem to run what j is mapped to
02:10  sjl: i.e. the two getline calls return the same value
02:10  sjl: (and using j SHOULD move the user down by two lines, not just one)
02:11  strull: that doesn't look like vim-syntax
02:11  iaj: jamessan: :lN is working for example
02:11  sjl: strull: ; == \n
02:11  sjl: (just wanted it one one line for IRC)
02:11  iaj: and in the upper left I get a [Location list]
02:11  homekevin: :vim should be an alias for :edit
02:11  iaj: jamessan: however when I type :ln it says No mapping found
02:12  homekevin: I'm always making that mistake.
02:12  strull: try echo getline('.') ; redraw ; normal j ; echo getline('.'
02:12  homekevin: iaj: It's lne
02:12  jamessan: iaj: right. it's :lne
02:12  strull: rather try echo getline('.') ; normal j ; redraw ;echo getline('.'
02:12  sjl: strull: Yep, tried that, no dice
02:12  jamessan: strull: someone keeps eating your )
02:13  walt: sjl: I like how you do not officially support non-pathogen installations ;)
02:13  strull: ooops
02:13  walt: pathogen should be standard bundle with vim, imo
02:13  sjl: walt: Yeah, Pathogen is the right way to do things.  I'd rather write more unit tests than support non-Pathogen people.
02:14 --- peth_ is now known as peth
02:14  homekevin: :(
02:14  homekevin: I... don't use pathogen.
02:14  sjl: homekevin: Start.
02:14  sjl: homekevin: It'll make sense once you start.  Especially if you just clone the plugins' repos into .vim/bundle
02:15  sjl: And ESPECIALLY if you use Mercurial and make the plugins git/hg subrepos
02:16  iaj: homekevin, jamessan thanks!
02:16  freshhawk: does anyone know why if i 'set ignorecase' then in vimscript "foobar" > '' is false, but if i 'set noignorecase' then it's true?
02:17  freshhawk: ruined my day trying to figure out why a plugin wasn't working properly until i hand edited my .vimrc file commenting out one line at a time
02:18  strull: I see no difference for this test
02:18  strull: what vim-version are you using?
02:18  walt: btw sjl, I had a problem with your plugin when I tried it a few months ago. The diff window does not seem to update when you move the selection
02:18  homekevin: freshhawk: What about using >? Vs >#?
02:18  walt: is it supposed to?
02:18  walt: otherwise, what is the point of the diff window?
02:18  sjl: walt: Move the selection how?  With just j/k?
02:18  walt: yes
02:18  sjl: Hmm
02:18  sjl: Can you update it and try again?
02:18  sjl: If it still happens something is definitely wrong
02:19  walt: sjl: ohh, sorry, it does work. It's just I usually use the arrow keys for moving in menus, so I did now
02:19  walt: sjl: and that did not work
02:19  walt: sorry
02:19  sjl: ahh
02:19  sjl: I should probably map the arrow keys
02:19  sjl: That seems reasonable
02:20  walt: sjl: would be cool if you mapped o to load the entry also, i.e do the same as enter
02:20  walt: sjl: most plugins do this
02:20  peth: freshhawk: same for me with 7.3: 'foobar' > '' false with ic, true with noic
02:20  walt: o is close to hjkl
02:21  sjl: walt: yeah, sounds reasonable.  o == open state
02:22  walt: sjl: yeah. thing is. I usually use arrow keys if enter is the mapped key for "open". And hjkl if o is mapped
02:22  walt: sjl: so you rplugin is kind of in the middle of that :)
02:22  walt: sjl: otherwise, I really like it!
02:22  rson: sjl: hey, did you see my note on github about t?
02:23  sjl: rson: I think it's still in my email... I'm wrestling down my inbox over time :(
02:23  sjl: rson: What was it?
02:23  strull: freshhawk, peth : must be some options then. I don't see this happen (vim7.3.81)
02:23  homekevin: 'foobar' > '' is always true for me.
02:23  rson: sjl: just a broken link on the webpage due to hard wraps in an unfortunate place in the file
02:23  homekevin: String ordering could be a locale thing, maybe
02:24  sjl: Ah, yeah, I remember that.  I'll look after I figure this out
02:25  peth: strull: nope. did gvim -u NONE -U NONE and set nocp, nothing else
02:25  rson: sjl: will feedkeys() not work in this case? (your normal j problem)
02:26  strull: peth: strange. same here
02:26  sjl: rson: Hmm, never heard of feedkeys... I'l need to try that
02:26  peth: weird, yes :)
02:26  strull: I mean, I did the same, still I don't see it happen
02:26  rson: sjl: i just remember glancing at it at some point, it may not help
02:26  peth: oh, weirder then
02:27  peth: must be homekevin's locale thing

13:12  marlun: I want to use terminal vim with 256 colors in osx. I've installed iTerm which supports it but vim still doesn't seem to use 256 colors. I read that it needs to be compiled with gui support which my vim does not seem to be. Does anyone have a good ./configure line I should use?
13:12  marlun: Is the one here: http://snippets.aktagon.com/snippets/406-How-to-compile-vim-MacVim-on-OSX-Snow-Leopard-with-clipboard-support good enough? It has --enable-gui=macvim not sure if that will help? I do have macvim installed but I still want to have 256 colors in terminal.
13:16  iaj: marlun: i got it configured that way and 256 color mode is working.. I'd drop a --enable-gui in there tho...
13:19  marlun: iaj: Remove the macvim?
13:21  iaj: ohhh 
13:21  iaj: I totally overread that one. Yeah should work then :)
13:21  marlun: Seem I'm missing something that that configure line adds: checking for tgetent()... configure: error: NOT FOUND!
13:22  mgedmin: missing build dependencies?

13:23  mgedmin: heh
13:23  nvictor: seku: thanks
13:23  mgedmin: I created a ~/bin/rebuild-vim7 script when I noticed I kept doing it
13:23  seku: thanks for thanks
13:23  mgedmin: maybe you can discover the configure line from config.log or some other file like that?
13:24  mgedmin: I don't think 256-color xterm support has anything to do with GUI support
13:24  mgedmin: check $TERM setting first
13:24  nvictor: seku: not working tho :)
13:25  seku: mm... i thought you wanted to move the window
13:25  mgedmin: nvictor, what do you mean by "move a window content"
13:25  iaj: marlun: strange...  why not use the new repo url anyhow?? https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim.git

13:25  mgedmin: try zl/zh/zL/zH for that

13:26  iaj: I saw that DerekWyatt remap <C-o> and <C-i> for 10zh and 10zl - that's not such an option right?
13:27  iaj: marlun: i know - but that version for sure - (and you can even start from Commandline) got the 256 color support
13:27  iaj: give it a try
13:29  iaj: marlun: http://pastebin.com/vS0rFmf1  < like that.
13:35  iaj: mgedmin: how's that rebuild-vim7 script look like?

13:40  marlun: iaj: Doesn't seem to  have gui support. echo has('gui') returns 0 and the colors is not correct.
13:40  iaj: mgedmin: thanks :)   how did you proceed to paste this ?
13:40  mgedmin: went to pastie.org and used my clipboard
13:41  mgedmin: pastie lets you put section names in there with ## name
13:41  iaj: mgedmin: ohh.. I thought theres some nifty command line tool, or VI Plugin
13:42  iaj: marlun: hmm you started that one by /Applications/MacVim/.../ ?
13:42  mgedmin: pastebinit is a semi-nifty cmdline tool that I use sometimes
13:42  iaj: mgedmin: can pastebinit send to pastie?
13:43  iaj: marlun: what does 'echo $TERM' in your shell tell?
13:43  mgedmin: I think so; I sent the patch upstream a while ago
13:43  mgedmin: there are probably better cmdline tools, but pastebinit has a memorable name and works sufficiently well
13:44  mgedmin: the config syntax is horrendous -- xml in a ~/.dotfile -- so I use a wrapper script to ask it to use pastie instead of that silly default one
13:46  bAndie9100: hi all! ;)
13:46  hemanth: how do switch between tabs?
13:47  iaj: mgedmin: ahhh... patch upstream?
13:47  mgedmin: a few years back pastebinit did not support pastie.org; I fixed that and sent the patch to the maintainer
13:48  mgedmin: but there were some complications -- instead of hardcoding everything in the source pastebinit supported configurable pastebins via multiple files in /etc
13:48  mgedmin: and my patch wasn't accepted as is
13:48  mgedmin: but now I ls and see a pastie.org config in /etc/pastebinit.d
13:48  mgedmin: so I assume it works
13:48  iaj: mgedmin: ahhh I see... well I just grabbed that pastebinit tool .. how can I configure it to use pastie?
13:48  iaj: I don't have that /etc/pastebinit.d :\
13:49  mgedmin: does it accept pastebinit -b http://pastie.org ?
13:52  iaj: mgedmin: yeah its working :)
13:52  iaj: echo 'foo' | pastebinit -b http://pastie.org | pbcopy   should work
13:53  mgedmin: it's a shame pastie.org doesn't support VimL highlighting, it's a very nice pastebin otherwise
13:56  marlun: iaj: it said xterm but I changed in iterm settings so it said xterm-256color and now it seems to work with the macvim vim :) Nice, then I don't have to recompile vim I can just use that one and when I update macvim it will be updated too I guess? nice
13:57  iaj: is there a pasteservice that's supporting vimL?
13:57  iaj: @ mgedmin 
13:58  mgedmin: iaj, see /topic ;)
13:58  iaj: marlun: yeh the $TERM setting is important -- dunno how far macvim is maintained/updated tho.. big changes will appear there somewhen :-)
13:58  iaj: mgedmin: ahhh.. so that's the only one service - I guess this one isn't supported by pastebinit
13:58  marlun: iaj I think it's pretty good at that, Björn seems very active in the mailinglist. Could be active there and still not update macvim though.
13:59  marlun: iaj: http://paste.pocoo.org/ has a Vim option.
14:03  mgedmin: it even has a vim plugin: http://paste.pocoo.org/help/integration/
14:05  bAndie9100: i found this great script 2ansi.vim
14:05  Eduard_Munteanu: Hi.
14:06  Eduard_Munteanu: It seems Vim automatically adds a newline at the end of a file, how can I prevent it?
14:06  bAndie9100: how to print directly to terminal instead of edit in vim nor save to file?
14:07  seku: cat file or less file
14:08  deryni: Eduard_Munteanu: :help 'eol ?
14:08  Eduard_Munteanu: deryni: thanks.
14:08  bAndie9100: seku, sorry. i wish display _with syntax highlighting!
14:09  bAndie9100: as 2ansi.vim converts files with ansi excape sequences
14:10  seku: bAndie9100: maybe you should look for a script. There is a vimpager or some such which makes vim work as a pager
14:11  Eduard_Munteanu: There, now Vim's a nice hex editor.
14:12  iaj: marlun: yeah Im using that lodgeit already
14:22  eto: hello
14:22  eto: is there a way to make vim change background color of the whole screen according to mode?
14:22  iaj: mgedmin: can I somehow also tell via pastebinit which filetype to use?
14:23  mgedmin: iaj, ever heard of command-line tools sometimes having options of the --help persuasion?
14:24  nate-: is there a way in vim to convert a color name (eg. grey20) to a hex color (eg. #CCCCCC) ?
14:25  iaj: mgedmin: I tried the -f flag already :\
14:28  MarcWeber: eto: Loarn looking at the bottom left. Then you don't need colours.
14:29  MarcWeber: You'll get used to the "vim way" soon - so you do no longer have to look at the corner
14:29  MarcWeber: You may have a chance getting what you want by using autocommands: :h au.
14:29  MarcWeber: Also keep in mind that you can hit <esc> always to get back to normal mode.
14:30  MarcWeber: Thus don't check whether you're in insert mode, just hit <esc> and continue.
14:30  eto: MarcWeber: not to offend anyone, I know vi and vim for years and trust me, it still irritates me like the first day i was accidentaly exposed to it
14:30  MarcWeber: if you use gvim the cursor shape will differ as well
14:30  MarcWeber: eto: :) sorry then.
14:30  eto: after so much fighting i am now giving it a try, so before my muscle memory builds up i would like to have at least this luxury
14:31  eto: bacause the truth is vi is only editor which is present on every platform
14:31  MarcWeber: eto: Do you know about autocommands?
14:32  eto: not yet i am glad, i can move around and switch back and forth between modes
14:32  eto: and do some typing
14:34  seku: you'll get the habit of exiting insert mode after writing what you write soon enough, and mode reads at the bottom of the screen. In gvim block cursor changes into bar... Although that doesn't really answer your question, does it :$
14:34  seku: u is undo and ctrl+r is redo
14:35  eto: this u key works only outside of insert mode i suppose
14:35  seku: of course... :D
14:35  MarcWeber: http://dpaste.com/285252/ @ seku (untested)
14:35 --- dive is now known as Guest25828
14:35  eto: i see, oh my this is completely different to what i am used to
14:35  MarcWeber: you can replace echoe by changing colours or whatever.
14:35  eto: is gvim in ruby?
14:36  seku: but good news is there are only a few modes. Normal for editing text, insert, replace, visual for selecting and ctrl+x for autocomplete
14:36  seku: :]
14:37  eto: ore better question yet, is it possible to enable such cursor behaviour in some generic xterm emulation and console?
14:38  seku: you mean to make it more like other editors?
14:38  seku: theres evim, but i don't know how you enter :commands such as :w filename to save
14:39  eto: well if changing cursor according to mode is considered "other editorish" then yes
14:39  seku: guess ctrl-o might work ;)
14:44  seku: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Configuring_the_cursor
14:45  seku: And use autocommands to change it when entering insert mode and normal mode. You're easier off using what it came with
14:47  massimo: Hi. Is there something for netrw-browsing that can recursively grep for file containing a pattern?
14:50  w0m: massimo:
14:50  w0m: :grep?
14:53  mgedmin: and :vimgrep
14:53  massimo: w0m: thanks. That was too easy...
14:59  genjix: how to tell vsp to open new windows on the right, not left?
14:59  genjix: *new buffers or w/e
14:59  mgedmin: :botright
14:59  genjix: thanks mgedmin  ;)
15:00 * mgedmin is trying to remember if there's an option for that ...
15:00  mgedmin: 'splitright' perhaps
15:00  mgedmin: yep
15:00  nate-: anyone have a list of all possible color names in vim and their respective hex values??
15:00  mgedmin: and I meant to say :rightbelow rather than :botright
15:00  genjix: mgedmin: it worked. thanks
15:00  mgedmin: although both work, they're subtly different
15:00  genjix: :set splitright
15:00  mgedmin: when you have nested splits
15:01  genjix: oh ill read the help on those then
15:02  genjix: tbh i dont know why vim splits on the left by default
15:03  genjix: majority of languages read left -> right so it makes sense
15:03  genjix: (to have splitright set by default)
15:07  iaj: how can I get the setting that's showing me how many lines are currenlty indented?
15:11  iaj: Gna, another thing - when I indent an html/xhtml file - this happens:  https://skitch.com/iiaj/rrk4s/google-notifier
15:11  iaj: can someone tell me what's going wrong there :(
15:12  mgedmin: vim's html indent plugin doesn't support xhtml
15:12  mgedmin: but no, that's not your problem ...
15:12  genjix: iaj: try set nopaste
15:12  mgedmin: what's the setting of 'ft'?
15:13  iaj: ft=xhtml
15:13  mgedmin: iaj, that file _tries_ to be xhtml, but isn't -- <meta ... should end in />, not just >
15:13  mgedmin: w3c recommends a space in front of />, for backwards-compat
15:13  iaj: nopaste isn't fixing a thng
15:13  mgedmin: so fix your xhtml and indentation will be fine
15:14  iaj: mgedmin: oooh.. thanks well yeah I just got that file from the source of some page
15:14  iaj: and stepped over that issue
15:14  iaj: gna...
15:14  iaj: that fixes it. thanks mgedmin 
15:15  mgedmin: (alternatively, if you don't want to modify the html code too much, try to set ft=html and reindent)
15:16  iaj: html does the same thing
15:16  iaj: I already tried
15:16  iaj: expects a <link to end in />

16:28  jetole: Hey guys. I installed my first addon yesterday, manpageview and I like it a lot but I'm kinda stumped on something I was hoping someone could help me with either from experience or if they understand the docs (http://www.jukie.net/bart/conf/vim/doc/manpageview.txt) better then me. If I am in a man page and I place the cursor over a reference to another man page (such as I am reading the man for bash and there is a line "string for strftime(3) to print" where ...
16:28  jetole: ... strftime(3) is referencing another man page). When my cursor is over that reference and I press K then it takes me to the new man page for whatever it was my cursor was over but I cannot figure out how to hit the virtual back button / go back to the page I was on before I changed to this one (such as in my example when I am reading the man page for bash, I follow strftime(3) and then I don't know how to get back to bash). I appreciate any help anyone ...
16:28  jetole: ... could offer me
16:28  jetole: oh damn that was longer then I thought
16:33  fow: jetole, I've not used manpageview, but try <c-o>
16:36  jetole: fow: what does that mean? I mean do I just type that?
16:36 * jetole tries
16:36  fow: jetole, it means ctrl+o (in normal mode)
16:40  jetole: fow: I se... oh. yeah that didn't work. I tried it before. I have a question though. I just posted two parts from the doc (http://pastebin.com/2gLK68VJ) referring to g:manpageview_winopen but I don't fully understand it and I don't actually know how to implement it but I have a feeling it may be what I need. Would you mind taking a look at that?
16:42  fow: jetole, example: let g:manpageview_open = 'only'
16:42  jetole: fow: perhaps not. I just tried RMan to another page and ctrl+o didn't work
16:42  jetole: fow: let me try that
16:46  jetole: fow: That didn't work but with only mode. I will try a couple others though I think it's just splits but I should mention that if I open a document and write text and then I go to a man page from inside the doc either with :Man or with the K key over a word I wrote, then when I run :q inside the man page I am returned to the doc. If I am in a man page and I open a info file (:Man coreutils.i) and then I run :q in the info file then I am returned to the first ...
16:47  jetole: ... man page. BTW fow, I know you're probably busy so it's cool whenever you decide you don't want to get too involved but if you're interested, this is where the addon came from: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=489
16:47  jetole: * with the "only" mode
16:48  fholgado: Hi guys, I've got a question for someone who uses MiniBufExpl and knows a bit of Vimscript... anyone out there?
16:49  FernandoBasso: vimgor: anyone
16:49  vimgor: Please do not ask if anyone uses, knows, is good with, can help you with or is a guru/expert of <some program>. Instead, ask your real question. You'll probably get help faster that way.
16:50  fholgado: Okey doke, here it is: https://gist.github.com/736363
16:51  fholgado: Basically adding a new state for MiniBufExpl tabs to highlight the buffer that you are currently active in.
16:51  jetole: Damn just when I thought I knew everything that I thought _I_ needed to know about vim, I'm getting thrown for a loop
16:52  fholgado: To prevent this from happening: http://fhl.gd/mhM where you have multiple buffer splits open and they are all shown as "visible" by minibufexpl
16:53  fholgado: And you lose indication of which buffer you are currently active in...
16:57  fholgado: I've gone through every "tabs" like buffer plugin in vim-scripts.org and did not find a single one that did this properly...
16:57  fholgado: Everything works lovely when you have just one buffer visible at a time, but it falls apart on splits
16:59  Boohemian: yay, i finally got vim working on linux... now for mac :)
16:59  Boohemian: i have used nano since 2003 - should be a *right* change
17:00 * tvm chuckles
17:00  fholgado: Boohemian, are you gonna use MacVim?
17:00  jetole: heh
17:03  dmsuperman: I want to read a gzipped file in vim
17:04  dmsuperman: My first instinct is to zcat and pipe to vim but
17:04  dmsuperman: It doesn't seem to support reading stdin
17:04  mtvee: Boohemian: you get that color issue figured out?
17:04  dmsuperman: IF I do zcat file | vim /dev/stdin it seems to load then instantly closes
17:04  dmsuperman: Vim: Error reading input, exiting...
17:04  dmsuperman: Vim: preserving files...
17:04  dmsuperman: Vim: Finished.
17:04  tvm: what about :r !zcat file ?
17:05  dmsuperman: Ah cool
17:05  mavvert: or cat file | vim -
17:06  dmsuperman: Strange that - works but not stdin :-/
17:06  dmsuperman: that did it mavvert
17:06  dmsuperman: danke
17:06  Boohemian: mtvee: yes :)
17:06 --- silex is now known as Silex

17:07  Boohemian: my first language will be perl, i think... (or python)
17:07  mtvee: Boohemian: what was the trouble or was it a combination of things?
17:07  Boohemian: i got fired from my job two days ago, so i want to spend winter break (until spring 2011 classes start again) learning as much as i can, so i don't feel like a complete waste
17:08  Boohemian: mtvee: the lines you told me to comment out
17:08  Boohemian: that and being tired and using # lines to comment out when i should have used " (never heard of " for commenting out -- is that vim-specific?)
17:09  mtvee: Boohemian: ah ok, hehe. well, glad it worked out! happy coding! :)
17:09  mtvee: yeah, vimscript uses quote for comment, i know not why
17:11  duff: if my term is 'screen-256color', how can I tell vim to ignore the '-256color' bit so it can actually recognize it?
17:11  tangledhelix: vim -T screen
17:11  duff: wonderful thanks
17:11  tangledhelix: duff: or any other terminal type after -T. vt100, xterm... whatever.
17:12  mgedmin: ugh
17:12  peth: duff: what do you mean, "actually recognize it"? vim should have no problem with screen-256color
17:12  mgedmin: better fix the terminfo db on that system
17:12  duff: its an older version of vim
17:13  mgedmin: it's not vim, it's the OS
17:13  duff: or its an older system in general
17:13  mgedmin: well, termcap/terminfo
17:14  peth: duff: often there's a package you can install with the entries. what system?

17:22  Miesco: E117: Unknown function: EnhCommentifyFallback4Embedded
17:22  Miesco: Like, this isn't even my fault I dont think
17:24  mgedmin: it might be, if you installed the plugin wrong
17:24  mgedmin: or it could be a bug in the plugin
17:24  duff: peth: its centos. But its a shared development server so I think I'll just get the sysadmin to fix it and use the -T screen for now
17:25 --- second is now known as sec^nd
17:25  peth: duff: ah. right then. you could also make screen report as "screen" in your ~/.screenrc
17:25  mgedmin: there could be a package, e.g. ncurses-extra, or something, with terminfo definitions for screen-256
17:25  mgedmin: I'm not familiar with centos
17:26  duff: actually screen works fine. I'm trying out tmux and that needs -256color at the end of the term or it wont recognize 256 color support
17:26  mgedmin: o debian that terminal is supported by ncurses-base
17:27  Boohemian: mtvee: what is gvim? is that when you are using X?
17:29  mgedmin: gvim is vim that uses a GUI window instead of relying on a terminal
17:29  mgedmin: more properly, gvim is the command that lauches vim in a GUI window
17:29  mgedmin: since the same vim executable can support both xterms and GUI
17:30  mgedmin: and you can switch from one to the other by typing :gui -- but you can't switch back
17:36  Miesco: How do I search for a symbol definition that the cursor is on?
17:38  mgedmin: *
17:38  mgedmin: no
17:38  mgedmin: gd/gD or ctrl-]
17:38  mgedmin: depending on various oh I'm sorry I'm too tired :(
17:39  mgedmin: :help has all the details, and now I've at least told you what useful keys you can look up ...

17:43  jink: ^__^
18:17  fholgado: anybody have an idea of how I can trigger an action on a plugin whenever a buffer enters focus?
18:17  mgedmin: have you looked at vim's event list?
18:17  fholgado: I want to update the tab color in minibufexpl based on the buffer that is currently focused?
18:17  fholgado: looking now...
18:17  mgedmin: something like BufEnter/BufLeave?
18:18  mgedmin: or BufWinEnter/Leave?
18:18  fholgado: ah BufEnter			After entering a buffer.  Useful for setting
18:18  fholgado: 				options for a file type.  Also executed when
18:18  fholgado: 				starting to edit a buffer, after the
18:18  fholgado: 				BufReadPost autocommands.
18:19  fholgado: should I create that event in the minibufexpl plugin or on my own vimrc?
18:26  peper: any idea why would !foo in gvim hang?
18:26  spiiph: peper, because foo doesn't return?
18:29  trutkin: anyone use neocomplcache?
18:29  trutkin: I'm trying to figure out where it's finding snippets for C++
18:35  peper: spiiph: nah
18:49  sitaktif: spiiph: peper maybe 'lazyredraw'-related ?
18:56  fholgado: trying to pass the current buffer name to a function, tried this and doesn't work
18:56  fholgado: noremap <unique> <script> <Plug>MBEMarkCurrent :call <SID>MarkCurrentBuffer(bufname(),1)<CR>:<BS>

19:06  spiiph: Never heard of such a shortcut. What installer did you use?
19:07  wessel: I think it is called cream
19:07  iaj: any good suggestions for a mapping for <Space> ?
19:07  wessel: I'll try remove it, what installed would you recommend for vim on windows?
19:08  wessel: I used this one: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cream/files/Cream/0.42/cream-0-42-gvim-7-2-245.exe/download
19:08  walt: vimgor: cream
19:08  vimgor: Cream is a fork of the vim project that tries to make vim simpler to use by hiding its modality. It is off topic here, as it's sufficiently different from vanilla vim that our gurus aren't likely to be able to help much with it. http://cream.sf.net (See also win32-patched)
19:09  walt: wessel: cream is the devil
19:13  wessel: okay, cool that worked, removed cream, installed vim, all seems fine now

19:37  graywh: :r !ls
19:37  ezzieyguywuf: ah, of course. thanks.
19:38  Dynetrekk: ezzieyguywuf: or visual-select an empty line, then type !ls
19:38  ezzieyguywuf: Dynetrekk: nice trick.
19:38  ezzieyguywuf: How do I do the same i on multiple lines?
19:39  ezzieyguywuf: I know ctrl-v does visual-select column-wise
19:39  ezzieyguywuf: but I can't i it.
19:39  seku: I write your stuff and esc
19:39  Dynetrekk: ezzieyguywuf: shift-v is "visual line". what happens is that the visual text is piped to stdin on the process you are running after "!" .
19:39  Dynetrekk: ezzieyguywuf: sorry, misunderstood the question
19:40  ezzieyguywuf: seku: how do I enter instert mode though.
19:40  seku: ezzieyguywuf: use capital I after using block visual to choose column
19:41  ezzieyguywuf: seku: that works. thanks.
19:46  iaj: graywh: thanks that looks nice
