00:28  funcao: hm
00:30  bosie: how can i set 'wrapped lines' by default
00:30  bosie: as opposed to pressing f9
00:31  Raimondi: bosie: in your vimrc  set wrap
00:31  bosie: Raimondi: set
00:31  bosie: Raimondi: it is actually set
00:32  bosie: but that doesn't wrap anything it seems
00:32  bosie: f9 sets list/nolist
00:32  Raimondi: Â¿?
00:32  peth: ^^
00:32  bosie: Raimondi: well
00:32  bosie: Raimondi: it wraps fine
00:33  bosie: Raimondi: but it formats the wrapped line as a block
00:33  bosie: Raimondi: "set nolist" solves that
00:33  bosie: thanks
00:33  Raimondi: Yeah, that's how it works.
00:44  zmbmartin: Anyone know why when I initiate command-t in urxvt/vim and try to arrow down that in my document a new line and "B" gets inserted above the cursor. I have nocomatiable set and this doesn't happen in xterm.
00:53  bsod1: how can I open a relative path?
00:54  MarcWeber: bsod1: related path?
00:54  fow: bsod1, exactl as you'd think
00:54  fow: *exactly
00:54  bsod1: fow: erm, I'm trying with just the file name but won't work
00:55  fow: bsod1, define "won't work"
00:55  frogonwheels: vimgor: doesn't work
00:55  vimgor: What happened? Did it fall asleep on your couch? Eat your homework? Destroy your hard drive? Is it making faces at you? Does it want more money? Is it sleeping with your best friend? Please be specific!
00:55  bsod1: fow: doesn't work, sorry for my english
00:55  fow: bsod1, I mean, what does Vim say when you try?
00:56  frogonwheels: bsod1: won't work is fine.. except that it tells us nothing :)
00:56  MarcWeber: bsod1: You can map something in commandline to expand to the dirname of the file you're editing. That's what I'm using
00:56  bsod1: fow: it opens a new file
00:56  bsod1: MarcWeber: how?
00:56  peth: zmbmartin: that's because urxvt sends ^[OB for the down arrow key and vim does not know about that mapping, so does: esc (^[), insert above (O), B
00:56  fow: bsod1, is Vim's current directory what you think it is? Check with :pwd
00:56  frogonwheels: bsod1: use :pwd to make sure you're in the correct dir
00:56  MarcWeber:   cmap >fd <c-r>=expand('%:p:h').'/'<cr>
00:56  MarcWeber: But you cna make vim also follow the current buf (which I personally find annoying)
00:57  bsod1: fow: peth: it's not in the same directory with the file I'm editing
00:57  MarcWeber: Then you can type >fd and the path of the current file will be inserted.
00:57  bsod1: MarcWeber: thanks, I'll try
00:57  fow: bsod1, then you can :cd to the path you want
00:58  bsod1: MarcWeber: it didn't work, I'm typing >fd but nothing happens
01:00  bsod1: MarcWeber: ops sorry, I typed after : and it worked
01:00  iaj: is there any way to well- wrap through the locationlist.. right now I only know that I can :ll to get to the first item... (or rather :ll 1) .. and then :lne to go through the list - and when @ end - I need to :lr for rewinding... is there some way to just have a key that lets one jump from one error to another with wrap mode?
01:01  bsod1: MarcWeber: what's the meaning of "fd" ?
01:01  jerojasro: iaj: opening the location window and choosing the first item
01:02  MarcWeber: bsod1: I used it as memonic = file directory.
01:02  MarcWeber: You can replace >fd by any string
01:02  bsod1: MarcWeber: ok, thanks
01:03  nate-: godlygeek, you here?
01:03  iaj: jerojasro: I want to define a mapping to be able to crawl through :\
01:07  zmbmartin: peth: how do I fix that?
01:11 --- mye is now known as mye^
01:14  peth: zmbmartin: it shouldn't really be there in the first place. i don't use (u)rxvt myself, but a quick web search shows an abundance of similar questions and proposed solutions, most of them for arch (are you running arch?). if no one knows a working solution, i'd try to make sense of those.
01:14  peth: *no one here
01:16  iaj: for the vimscripters.... how can I get the length of an array - eg if I do for a in variable ... how can I get the length of variable? eg. its count?
01:16  fow: zmbmartin, what does :se term? (with the question mark) say?
01:16 --- mye^ is now known as mye
01:16  mye: nmap <esc> :wa<cr> seems like a nice shortcut to me. But it puts some garbage in the cmdline buffer on vim startup... :261;0c. I have no idea why though!?!
01:17  zmbmartin: fow: term=rxvt-256color
01:17  fow: zmbmartin, that's the problem
01:18  fow: zmbmartin, are you using the patch that gives urxvt 256 colors?
01:18  iaj: mye: hmm I don't think that is such a wise choice.. what if you don't recognize hitting escape.. it saves.. you close a file which you originally didn't wanna have saved.. ok theres persistent undo now but
01:18  iaj: anyway:)
01:18  zmbmartin: fow: I am not sure, I just installed from arch repos
01:19  fow: zmbmartin, ah, not sure if they include it or not. Does echo $TERM in your shell match what Vim says?
01:20  zmbmartin: fow: Yeah I can change it via Xdefaults should it be xterm-256colors?
01:20  fow: zmbmartin, you probably shouldn't change it at all. But I have it set to rxvt-unicode
01:21  mye: iaj, I should still try it I think, as <esc> is mapped so prominently, why not reuse it in normal mode? But this weird going into cmd mode on startup. It works fine for a running vim.
01:26  zmbmartin: fow: same problem with rxvt-uncode
01:26  zmbmartin: fow: the arrow keys work with xterm-256color but the esc key stopped working.
01:32  iaj: zmbmartin: bad trade;)
02:15 --- peth_ is now known as peth
02:24 --- f00li5h is now known as f00li5h[HireMe]
02:36  iaj: Any way in vimscript to find out whether the quickfix window is currently active (shown as a window)?
02:38  iaj: I know theres &buftype ... but that would only help if its the current active window.
02:48 --- f00li5h[HireMe] is now known as f00li5h
02:49  maxxe: found a bug in vim i think, set cino=b1 doesn't work as expected.. :>
02:54  iaj: How can I source a whole folder :so /path/to/folder/*   won't work :/
03:07  jmcantrell: iaj: for loop + glob() might be one way
03:17 --- pi-rho|away is now known as pi-rho
03:30  iaj: jmcantrell: hmm thanks - thought there would be an easier way
03:30  jamessan: iaj: if the folder is one under 'runtimepath', you can do ":runtime subfolder/*"
03:33  Kuukunen: I wonder if :runtime /absol/lute/dir  works :P
03:34  iaj: ahhww jamessan so I'd do let &rtp+=/folder/here   and :runtime /folder/here/* ?
03:34  Kuukunen: or you could just do a temporary file and "cat * > blah"
04:03  iaj: Kuukunen: right. :)
04:04 --- pi-rho is now known as darkcipher

04:14  nate-: where can I get a list of all available colors in gvim with their respective hex codes?
04:27  iaj: someone using eclim?
04:29  Ademan: so /^[3508 matches a line "[3508] ...." but /^[3508] doesn't... I figure it's parsing that as a character class specification, but that's a bit too magical for me
04:29  Ademan: anyways how do I properly escape the second form to match?
04:30  Ademan: hrm it seems escaping either or both of the [ and ] will do it
04:32  Tau: hello. is there some way to call a python routine when the script is unloaded ?
04:34  Tau: i have a script in python which i loaded inside the vim. this script creates a directory using python routines. so. i want to call a function when the vim is gonna be closed to remove this directory.
04:34  iaj: how can I check in vimL the result that a certain command gives?
04:35  Tau: is ther some way to make the vim call a python function like a callback ?
04:35  Tau: Ionic, well. i think it is something like eval idk
04:44  iaj: Tau: that was directed to me uh? :-D 
04:44  Tau: iaj, yea
04:45  Tau: iaj, do you know how i can make a routine to be called when vim is closed ?
04:46  iaj: Tau: sorry I don't have a clue.. im new to that sorta stuff myself...
04:46  Tau: iaj, k
04:46  iaj: seems like no one is up :)
04:46  Tau: iaj, yea
04:47  Tau: iaj, do you know python ?
04:47  iaj: Tau: not yet but this one is gonna be the nxt language im gonna learn
04:47  iaj: heard so much about it
04:50  Tau: iaj, yeah.
04:50  Tau: that is powerful.
05:16  sec^nd: how well does vim-addon-manager work ?
05:16  sec^nd: I want something to manage my plugins
05:17  rtyler: is it possible for Vim to change the terminal background color between what's in 80 columns and what's longer?
05:18  Tau: sec^nd, do you know how to make a callback function to pass to vim ?
05:18  Tau: i want it to be called when the vim is gonna close.
05:18  sec^nd: Tau: no
05:18  sec^nd: rtyler: you need an if statement in your vimrc for that
05:18  sec^nd: I'm not a vim expert
05:18  sec^nd: :/
05:19  sec^nd: they seem to be sleeping right now
05:19  rtyler: heh
05:19  Tau: i'm lost.
05:19  Tau: i need only it to finish my plugin.
05:19  rtyler: Tau: no you're not, you're in #vim :D
05:20  Tau: rtyler, lol
05:21  sec^nd: Tau: use autobufs
05:21  sec^nd: hmm wrong name
05:21  Tau: sec^nd, hmm, the problem is that i create temporary directory.
05:22  Tau: then i need to remove it
05:22  Tau: i'm using python.
05:22  Tau: i need to remove the temporary directories when the program finishes.
05:22  sec^nd: augrp
05:22  sec^nd: http://vim.dindinx.net/vim7/html/usr_43.txt.php
05:23  sec^nd: hmm
05:23  sec^nd: autocmd maybe
05:23  sec^nd: Tau: ^
05:25  Tau: sec^nd, humm
05:25  Tau: i will take a look, sec^nd , thank u
05:25  sec^nd: np
05:27  Tau: sec^nd, yes. i think that is what i want.
05:27  Tau: ;)
05:27  sec^nd: :)
05:50  nate-: just submitted my first vim plugin :D
05:51  Tau: congratz naquad .
05:51  Tau: nate-,
05:51  nate-: thanks
05:51  mtvee: submitted to where?
05:52  Evanlec: vimwiki is cool
05:52  Evanlec: nate-: what is it?
05:52  nate-: to vim.org
05:52  nate-: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3361
05:52  mtvee: ah, nice!
05:54  nate-: time to watch some boardwalk empire!!
05:54  Evanlec: nate-: i started watching that, but was kinda boring first episode
05:54  mtvee: nate, that look great
05:55  nate-: Evanlec, most shows start out sorta boring, a few eps in and it's pretty sweet
05:55  Evanlec: nate-: yea...i guess i should give it a second shot
05:55  nate-: I was the same with the wire
05:55  nate-: and that show was awesome
05:57  Evanlec: Prison Break 1st season was great
05:58  nate-: my fav show at the moment is dexter
05:58  nate-: this season and last season have been amazing
05:58  Evanlec: nate-: that one seemed good
05:58  Evanlec: 5 seasons though, im too far behind
05:58  nate-: hah
05:58  nate-: catch up, it's wort it
05:58  nate-: worth*
05:58  nate-: books are good too
05:59  Evanlec: spose i should start from 1st season
06:01  glyph: If I use :VCSStatus from VCSCommand, does the resulting buffer have any special keybindings in it?  Or do I just have to manually copy/paste the filenames to do anything?
06:03 @MetaCosm: none that I know of
06:06  iaj: I got a question, when I got a function (.....   that extends to lines.. how can I set the behavior how the second line gets indented?
06:06  iaj: I tried coptions=(0  but that didn't work :(
06:09  iaj: thts a java file btw :\
07:24  andyferra: I'm trying to map '#' in insert mode to a function, and that function should sometimes does something else and sometimes just inserts '#'... but I'm getting a E169 recursion too deep error... how do I get around that?
07:33  andyferra: I've tried using put='#' but that is doing a linewise put and I need it to just insert the input as usual
07:40  ecmuller: hey, this probably should be obvious but I'm having trouble getting it to work
07:40  ecmuller: I have 2 files in a split window, I want to overwrite one with the other
07:40  ecmuller: :w! doesn't work
07:41  ecmuller: or rather :w! otherfilename
07:43  ecmuller: is there a better way to acheive that
07:44  iaj: ecmuller: i dunno.. i'd maybe just ggyG switch over ggVGp
07:46  ecmuller: hmmm
07:46  iaj: but I think there's some better way- just no one around at the moment :(
07:51  ecmuller: yeah it's not really cut and paste I'm looking for although that gets it done
07:51  iaj: oh.. mhhh you can maybe do something with :r ?
07:53  ecmuller: there's a good reason not to overwrite something that's open in another buffer I imagine, the error makes sense
07:54  iaj: yep:D
07:54  ecmuller: hmmm...actually that might do it
07:56  iaj: ã
07:57  ecmuller: thanks, that'll do it
08:18  pen: hey
08:18  pen: is there any good eclipse plugin that will bring vim power to eclipse?
08:29  cirwin: pen: eclim might be what you're after
08:29  pen: cirwin: nah, I prefer to have ide environment but vim keybindings now, I'm using vrapper
08:29  pen: just start using it
08:30  pen: it's kind of cool actually
08:36  cirwin: i thought it offered both
08:36 * cirwin tried it once for eclipse stuff in vim, it's nae too bad
08:37  pen: cirwin: actually no. eclim is bringing IDE features to vim
08:37  cirwin: sorry to misinform you
08:40  pen: yea, I just prefer developing Java in eclipse.
08:40  cirwin: understandable :)
08:40  pen: but miss the vim keybindings :P
08:40  cirwin: http://eclim.org/eclimd.html#gvim-embedded
08:41  cirwin: there was a vim compatibility mode for eclipse too â I think I remember finding it dreadful
08:42  wahnfrieden: theyre always so incomplete that theyre awful for actual vim users :/
08:42  wahnfrieden: viemu for vs.net seems somewhat ok though
08:43  nate-: I've used many vim emulators and none of them came close to the real deal
08:43  wahnfrieden: have you tried ViEmu? it's commercially supported and been around a while
08:43  wahnfrieden: so it seems fairly advanced as far as they go
08:44  wahnfrieden: it's more than just key bindings to the host app
08:44  nate-: that's one I'll probably never try, being that it's for visual studio
08:44  wahnfrieden: heh, right
08:45  nate-: but it's good to know it's available if I ever should venture into .net
08:45  nate-: I've actually seen a few positive things about it
09:33  bloger: how do I disable indent on gwap for html files?
09:34  bloger: set formatoptions=tcrq
09:34  bloger: set autoindent noai
09:34  bloger: set smartindent nosi
09:34  bloger: set cindent nocin
09:34  bloger: set smarttab nosta
10:45  FernandoBasso: misunderstanding
10:45  FernandoBasso: Oops.
10:46  Ademan: is there a way to dump the marks for a current buffer? sometimes I go away and come back and forget what marks I have
10:52  Raimondi: Ademan: :h :marks
11:05  Ademan: Raimondi: thanks
11:17  bloger: how do I disable indent on gwap for html files only?
11:35  bloger: how to !ls tempname?

12:01  Dynetrekk: vim omnicomplete with python: 1) can I make ctrl-space replace ctrl-x ctrl-o, which is a bit awkward?
12:01  Dynetrekk: and 2) I thought I saw a screenshot with the doc string of functions show up when using omnicomplete, is this possible?
12:01  FernandoBasso:  :map <C-Space> <C-X><C-O>
12:02  FernandoBasso:  Sorry, :inoremap
12:02  FernandoBasso: Instead of :map
12:03  Dynetrekk: FernandoBasso: thanks, works great. only thing is, I forgot I am using that shortcut for something else :P
12:03  FernandoBasso: haha
12:04  Dynetrekk: I am using it for quicksilver in osx
12:05  Dynetrekk: gah, what to do! I need a bigger keyboard :P do you know anything about python docstrings?
12:05  FernandoBasso: Sorry, I don't.
12:07  Dynetrekk: right. well, thanks, now I need to decide what to do with my shortcuts...
12:07  FernandoBasso: I have ^z^z instead of ^Space for omnicomplete.
12:08  Dynetrekk: FernandoBasso: oooh, sounds better. is there any harm in just ^z?
12:09  FernandoBasso: Dynetrekk: :verbose :inoremap <c-z><c-z> will tell you.
12:09  wahnfrieden: Dynetrekk: also consider just using <leader> for custom mappings
12:11  Dynetrekk: wahnfrieden: what do you mean? I don't know <leader>.
12:11  Dynetrekk: FernandoBasso: it seems to work without any hitches right now
12:11  FernandoBasso: Dynetrekk: The same here.
12:11  wahnfrieden: you set <leader> to some key, and use it for remappings
12:11  FernandoBasso: Also, what wahnfrieden just said is sure to be considered.
12:11  wahnfrieden: \ is common
12:11  wahnfrieden: I use , and remap , to something else since I don't use it often
12:12  Dynetrekk: wahnfrieden: oh, so you always use the same key for all your remappings?
12:12  wahnfrieden: yea so that i'm positive there will be no collisions
12:12  Dynetrekk: what does , do anyway?
12:12  Dynetrekk: I use , for commenting.... ,c specifically
12:12  wahnfrieden: I forget actually
12:13  FernandoBasso: Dynetrekk: With the <Leader> (\) we do not type two keys at the same time, we hit \ and quickly hit another key.
12:13  wahnfrieden: yeah me too, since I have ,c mapped to NERD-commenter
12:13  Dynetrekk: wahnfrieden: that's the one
12:13  wahnfrieden: well not ,c
12:13  Dynetrekk: \ is very awkward on my norwegian keyboard
12:13  wahnfrieden: <leader>c
12:13  Dynetrekk: what do I actually type? inoremap <leader> , ?
12:14  Dynetrekk: I haven't done remappings before
12:14  FernandoBasso: Yeah.
12:14  FernandoBasso:  :inoremap <Leader>z <c-x><c-o>
12:15  Dynetrekk: hm, doesn't work...
12:16  Dynetrekk: this is what I have http://paste.pocoo.org/show/303855/
12:16  Dynetrekk: m
12:21  FernandoBasso: Dynetrekk: It is wrong.
12:21  Dynetrekk:  FernandoBasso: I found it: let mapleader = ","
12:21  FernandoBasso: Yeah.
12:21  FernandoBasso: I was about to say it.
12:21  FernandoBasso: :D
12:22  Dynetrekk: google ftw
12:23  FernandoBasso:  :let mapleader = ','
12:23  FernandoBasso:  :inoremap ,z <c-x><c-o> should do it.
12:23  Dynetrekk: that's exactly what I hve now
12:23  Dynetrekk: except <leader>z not ,z
12:24  FernandoBasso: Well, I think ,z is a must now.
12:27  bloger: why got different sytanx highlight on "set filetype=html" and "runtime! syntax/html.vim"?
13:20  BlueBeret: hi. I believe there was an option in vim to save files under an alternate name and only replace the original ones once the write is finished (thus being safe for updating live web pages), but I forgot what it was called. does anyone know?
13:25 --- altamic_ is now known as altamic
13:36  fow: BlueBeret, 'writebackup'
13:59  complete: Hey People! You know, what Im really missing in VIM? A tab bar with a tab for every open file.
14:04 --- altamic_ is now known as altamic
14:04  BlueBeret: wow, you have trolls in here, too?
14:10  tmr: Surprised?
14:12  seku: he isn't trolling, i think
14:13  seku: its the way he is used to use vim
14:13  Dynetrekk: doesn't vim have a "tab bar"?
14:13  fow: vimgor, tabs
14:13  vimgor: Tab pages are not buffers, don't try to force them to act like buffers. Consider tab pages like viewports, layouts, or workspaces. Trying to setup 1 tab page == 1 buffer is an exercise in futility. Do ':set hidden' and get started. Get FuzzyFinder, LustyExplorer or BufExplorer to make getting around your buffers easier. See http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Tabs for more info.
14:15  complete: i like to have a bar with all open buffers on top of my screen
14:15  Dynetrekk: fow: are you saying tabs are evil?
14:15  seku: hey complete, isn't there plugins which show you open buffers all the time
14:15  seku: that'd do what you want
14:15  seku: minibufexplorer or something
14:15  complete: when i work locally, i realize it by having one terminal per vim and gnome terminal manager displays a nice tab bar.
14:15  fow: Dynetrekk, not at all. I love tabs and do use them a good amount. Vim tabs are just used differently than they are in other programs
14:15  Dynetrekk: fow: how?
14:15  complete: but i move more and more onto remote servers
14:16  complete: and work via ssh.
14:16  complete: and i what i miss most is a tab bar with one tab per file.
14:17  Dynetrekk: complete: in my vim, there is a tab bar on top
14:17  complete: Dynetrekk: one tab for every file?
14:17  seku: well, vim tabs aren't that kind of tabs. They're containers for groups of windows, more like. Check minibufexplorer or something. That does what you want
14:17  complete: i dont want to go the "vim way" of multiple files per tab.
14:17  Dynetrekk: complete: I thought so
14:18  fow: Dynetrekk, like vimgor said, they're more like viewports. Say I have two files open in a split, and I want to do the same with two files unrelated to the two I have open now. I'll open a tab and split those other two files, so that my splits don't get small and so I only have related files open in a view
14:18  complete: i know all that
14:18  complete: i just dont use it
14:18  complete: i use a tab bar with one tab per file and one file per tab
14:19  Dynetrekk: fow: aha, I see
14:19  Dynetrekk: fow: it kinda boils down to screen real estate I guess
14:19  fow: Dynetrekk, somewhat, yeah
14:20  seku: can i remove toolbar from gvim
14:21  complete: guess i will have dive into screen to get my tabs on remote machines.
14:21  seku: as you see fit
14:24  Dynetrekk: seku:  :set guioptions-=T
14:24  seku: Dynetrekk: thanks
14:25  tmr: complete, :he 'stal
14:28  complete: tmr: that doesnt help me. i need a "one file per tab, one tab per file" behaviour. i guess i will only achieve it via screen.
14:28  tmr: Oh sorry, I thought you needed tabline..
14:29  complete: i hope screen has tabs. i only used it for quick co-coding so far. never did fancy stuff with it.
14:29  tmr: So now you want one vim per file.
14:30  complete: yes
14:30  complete: thats how i work locally all the time
14:30  complete: but now im coding on a remote machine
14:34  ws: I have a question about Win 7 system sounds -- I changed the windows beep to point to another .wav file, which is also a RIFF (little-endian), 16 bit, steero 44100 Hz -- but the wav is played differently by windows media player than in the "test" button in "Sound" Control Panel entry... has anyone encountered this problem?
14:34  ws: ops, sorry
14:34  ws: was meant to to send it to another channel
14:36  ws: unless someone knows if I could change the beep sound in gvim itself, which would be still a valid question here :-)
14:37  tmr: complete, isn't tabbar exactly what you want then, I'm confused.
14:38  complete: comex: what do you mean with "tabbar"? vims tabbar?
14:39  tmr: complete, :set stal=2
14:41  complete: tmr: that will not put a list of all open files on my screen
14:41  complete: it will just.. uhm... put the path and name of the current file on the screen.
14:42  ws: complete:  are you using buffers, windows or tabs?
14:43  complete: ws: at the moment im using one buffer per tab. but its not a good solution. what i would like is a list of all open files permanently on the screen. like the tab bar in other programs.

14:50  virus_found: Hello. How do I delete all lines, starting with #       Doesn't work, like in sed: %/^#/d
14:51  iaj: virus_found: :he :g    you want :g/^#/d

15:08  garotosopa: How do I make Vim to save a temporary file so I can use :!run php %
15:09  garotosopa: sorry, there's no "run" there. I meant :!php %
15:11  seku: :w|!php %
15:12  seku: although thats not
15:12  seku: a temp file
15:13  iaj: :w! tempfile|!php tempfhile  should work 
15:13  iaj: s/fhi/fi
15:14  garotosopa: yeah but I didn't want to remove the regular file 'tempfile' manually
15:14  garotosopa: of course I could always do :w /tmp/foo. I was just hoping there were something like that built in
15:15  nico_le_terrible: hi all :p

15:20  tdn: How do I remove all trailing whitespace from lines in vim?
15:20  tdn:  /\s$ only finds the last whitespacechar.
15:21  tdn: I want to remove all trailing whitespaces.
15:21  nico_le_terrible: :%s/ *$//gc
15:21  nico_le_terrible: something like that ;)
15:21  nico_le_terrible: Supposing it's greedy ;)
15:22  tdn: Ok. Thanks.
15:23  fow: yes, * is greedy in Vim regex
15:23  nico_le_terrible: it doesn't work well :s
15:23  nico_le_terrible: he ask me for each char in the file :s
15:23  Kuukunen: isn't * greedy in all regexps?
15:23  nico_le_terrible: but change only trailing spaces :s
15:23  fow: /\s*/ should work fine
15:23  Kuukunen: all I've ever used anyway :S
15:23  fow: Kuukunen, I think so, now that I think about it
15:24  nico_le_terrible: fow = /\s*$/
15:24  fow: err yes, nico_le_terrible
15:26  seku: garotosopa: write a function?
15:26  seku: and map it
15:26  garotosopa: seku, agreed. thanks.
15:32  nico_le_terrible: and no one could help for OmniCompletion ? :$
15:36  seku: you'd need to be more elaborate
15:39  nico_le_terrible: I do :set ofu=syntaxcomplete#Complete and when I do <C-X><C-O>, it tells me thaht :"omnifunc is not enable"
15:39  nico_le_terrible: I have a ctags in my dir ;)
15:40  mattcodes: how do I change the current work directory to that of the current doc being edited without having to manually do :cd /blah/blah/blah
15:41  peth: mattcodes: see :help cmdline-special and :help filename-modifiers
15:41  peth: as in :cd %:p:h or :lcd %:p:h
15:42  nico_le_terrible: set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete
15:42  nico_le_terrible: set completeopt=menuone,menu,longest,preview

15:44  iaj: nico_le_terrible: no clue about that omnifunc.. did you try omni on other files?
15:44  nico_le_terrible: yeah ;)
15:44  maxxe: MetaCosm: yeah :)
15:45  iaj: nico_le_terrible: and its working there?
15:45  nico_le_terrible: no :s
15:45  maxxe: MetaCosm: what's strange about that?
15:45  nico_le_terrible: always the same error
15:45  iaj: on other filetypes - with other omnifunc set.
15:46 @MetaCosm: maxxe, http://devnul.9c0.com/Vim_Movement_Shortcuts-wallpaper.png

15:52  mountained: does anyone use eclim?
15:53  iaj: mountained: trying to.... but its driving me crazy sometiems -_-
15:54  mountained: iaj codecompl is not set
15:54  iaj: mountained: when does that occur??  eclim with java?
15:54  mountained: iaj, yes
15:55  iaj: :PingEclim is working?
15:55  mountained: yes seams so
15:55  mountained: eclim   1.6.1
15:55  mountained: eclipse 3.6.1
15:55  iaj: when does the codecompl is not set appear?
15:55  mountained: <ctrl-x><ctrl-u>
15:56  iaj: so when you are on a word and type :JavaSearchContext<CR>  its crying about the same?
15:56  singlecore: dudes
15:56  iaj: or... rather is JavaSearchContext an available command?
15:57  iaj: cos if not its your projectsettings somehow.
15:57  singlecore: is there an option that makes vim remember the last cursor position for a re-opened file?
15:57  mountained: ok now its not available
15:57  iaj: 'now'? What did you do?
15:57  fow: singlecore, :h last-position-jump
15:58  mountained: ah no ;-) it isnt available
15:58  singlecore: thx fow
15:58  mountained: :ProjectList does work
15:58  nico_le_terrible: singlecore: gi
15:59  nico_le_terrible: not really the last position, but the last editing position
16:00  iaj: mountained: Do a ProjectImport /file/path/to/project
16:01  singlecore: nico_le_terrible, that was what i meant
16:01  mountained: iaj, already exists
16:01  nico_le_terrible: singlecore: so... cool \o/
16:02  fow: wlcm, singlecore
16:02  iaj: mountained: So when you are in the file and hit :ProjectInfo its returning something??  And putting cursor on a word and typing :JavaSearchContext  ain't working as well?  No clue then :D
16:02  singlecore: fow, wlcm == welcome?
16:03  nico_le_terrible: wildcharm ?
16:03  fow: singlecore, thx == thanks? ;)
16:04  mountained: iaj, :ProjectInfo works :JavaSearchContext doesnt
16:04  nico_le_terrible: thx is often used, wlcm less
16:04  iaj: mountained: I don't have a clue then :\\\\\\\\ :JavaSearch <exisiting class>  neither?
16:04  singlecore: fow, truly this was what i meant :)
16:05  mountained: iaj, no neither
16:05  iaj: i read wlcm the first time :) looks like a vim option for me.
16:05  iaj: s/for/to
16:06  mountained: iaj,  but there was a waring while starting eclimd : WARN  [org.eclim.plugin.jdt.PluginResources] Unable to locate jre src.zip for JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.22/jre
16:06  iaj: mountained: think that doesn't matter.. did you try both eclimd  and the one in eclipse?
16:07  mountained: iaj, only in vim
16:07  mountained: should i try eclipse?
16:07  iaj: eclipse, then open a new view - eclim... and try then from within vim.. as its called headed mode.
16:07  iaj: but I doubt that will work... ;\
16:08  singlecore: nico_le_terrible, whats the first autocmd argument for buffer opened event?
16:08  iaj: i've made the experience - that if its working on eclipse correctly and everything is set up smoothly - then compl in eclim is working as well
16:08  nico_le_terrible: singlecore: don't know
16:09  singlecore: nvm
16:09  singlecore: means nevermind
16:09  singlecore: ;)
16:11  singlecore: nico_le_terrible, it was BufEnter
16:11  Tobias|: Is there a way to make gvim use my system's file open dialogues instead of its default ones?
16:11  singlecore: i should read more and ask less
16:12  DHulme: Tobias|: No, no one uses them anyway.
16:14  mattcodes: what the vimrc option for f and F to search all lines not just the current one?
16:14  mountained: iaj, i think i need to install gvim first...
16:14  zmbmartin: how do I map copy -> "+y to something like Alt C?
16:14  Tobias|: How can I get rid of the buttons then, DHulme?
16:15  iaj: zmbmartin: map <M-c> "+y   I think
16:15  DHulme: Tobias|: by changing the value of the 'guioptions' option
16:15  DHulme: mattcodes: use / instead of f and ? instead of F when you want to do that
16:16  zmbmartin: iaj: no I tried that. It does not work.
16:16  iaj: zmbmartin: which OS?
16:17  zmbmartin: iaj: ArchLinux
16:19  mountained: iaj, no doesnt work either
16:20  indietrash: how can I delete every line that doesn't start with "<"?
16:21  fow: indietrash, :v/^</d
16:22  indietrash: fow: thanks!
16:22  iaj: zmbmartin: hmm works for me :\  
16:23  fow: you're welcome
16:23  iaj: mountained: bah... that's odd... maybe try to create a project in vim from scratch according to the manual on eclim.org -_-
16:24  mountained: iaj, i think i need to install the filetypeplugin
16:26  mountained: iaj, no doesnt help
16:26  iaj: mountained: sorry no clue then :(
16:36  mountained: iaj, now it works just fine think the installer messed up some dirs so it copied the plugins into the wrong direction
16:36  iaj: mountained: nice!  :-)
16:53  nico_le_terrible: I want to map something to add // to the begining of the line
16:53  nico_le_terrible: I don't see how manage it
16:54  spiiph: nico_le_terrible, I suggest using a commenting plugin
16:54  spiiph: Such as NERD_commenter

19:04  henrikbjorn: has_gui
19:04  iaj: has('gui')  ain't accomplishing what I want

19:20  jerojasro: kongo: can you suggest anything?
19:25  kongo: jerojasro: I would just try to add some like "%-Gmsgfmt"

20:26  Geralt: hi, is it possible to move between folds that are on the same level?
20:26  cirwin: iaj: the tags aren't typed, so it's not easy to fix, you can just go to the next tag
20:26  iaj: cirwin: how would I go on to the next?
20:27  MarcWeber: Geralt: :h zj
20:27  MarcWeber: search nearby that.
20:27  MarcWeber: iaj: :tjump then :tnext
20:28  MarcWeber: Geralt: Also see :h foldlevel.
20:28  iaj: cirwin: well when I watch the tags file - theres a notation there the tag leads to - and in the description is the classname as well :\
20:29  cirwin: right, but when looking at a string in a file, vim doesn't look at context
20:29  cirwin: it's probably fixable if you want to spend a few days writing a plugin
20:30  iaj: cirwin: ahh..i pass.
20:30  MarcWeber: iaj: For C/C++ there exists a vim patch. You can alsot ry making your tagging application output line numbers instead of regex
20:30  iaj: I just thought it was possible to browse for a tag + something in its description
20:32  trone: Hi there. I would copy a file portion in my current buffer. Usually I open a window with split, and yank&paste the portion. Is possibile give some parameters (lines range?) and use read? ( I use read to append the full file, not a portion) I've looked in help read, but not understand really well.
20:32  Geralt: MarcWeber: as far as I understand zj and zk they move to the next/previous fold, regardless of the foldlevel of the fold below the cursor
20:32  iaj: Oh well :tn :tp will do then i guess :)
20:35  cxreg: :q
20:43  MarcWeber: Geralt: so create your own mapping which calls normal zj until foldlevel() is equal again ?
20:43  MarcWeber: or close the fold you're on before running zj
20:43  MarcWeber: eg zmzj

21:06  firecat53: Raimondi: well, I think so...I rarely edit more than 4 or 5 files at once, so it seems to have the info about buffers that I'm looking for. I tried minibufexplorer, but it seemed to have some issues after using it for a few days...
21:07  firecat53: Raimondi: and :ar gives a nice list of buffers with [] around the active one

22:57  Fatih`: Hi
22:58  Fatih`: Can I append line to a spesific line in vim.current.buffer ? the append method of vim.current.buffer appends the line at the end of file.
23:03  evanton: Fatih`: I would try to replace the line with line+new content, assuming the line in question matches only once, that should work
23:05  Fatih`: evanton, I have to add 6 lines in a column that are different, these are XML tags.
23:06  Raimondi: Fatih`: :h append()
23:08  Fatih`: Raimondi, thanks a lot
23:09  evanton: XML is not text, I'd rather use a DOM API to fiddle with it
23:11  mr_daniel: I have a server and a local desktop machine. The vim on the server is nicely configured, e.g. with syntax highlighting. But the vim configuration of my local desktop machine is bad, e.g. no syntaxy highlighting. Also when I enter 'manipulation/edit mode' with 'i', the arrow keys are not working properly and I don't like this.
23:12  mr_daniel: I already checked the following configuration files, but there are the same on the server and on the desktop machine: /etc/vim/vimrc, /etc/vim/vimrc.tiny
23:12  mr_daniel: The ~/.vimrc file doesn't seem to be a configuration file, but some sort of history file
23:12  mr_daniel: So my question: how is vim configured? There must be a configuration file somewhere which introduces the difference in the behavior between my server and desktop vim environment
23:12  evanton: mr_daniel: there's also ~/.vim
23:12  evanton: it's a whole directory and user specific settings overwrite global settings
23:13  homekevin: Adman65: I could take a look at that colorscheme, but I'll need a URL.
23:14  mr_daniel: evanton: unfortunately there is no ~/.vim/ folder, neither on the server or the desktop machine
23:14  strull_: mr_daniel: what makes you think ~/.vimrc is a history file ?
23:14  evanton: btw ~/.vimrc is not supposed to be a history file indeed
23:15  evanton: ~/.viminfo is a history file
23:15  mr_daniel: sorry, I mean it seems like that ~/.viminfo is a history file

23:26  Boohemian: homekevin: do you know of a theme for vim that doesn't require simbl?
23:26  homekevin: Boohemian: I don't know what simbl is, and I don't know of a colorscheme that requires it.
23:26  Fatih`: MarcWeber, wow that's great, really god tip, thanks

23:46  zulax: i am trying to integrate sound on my vim insert mode
23:46  zulax:   silent! exec '!afplay ~/.vim/support/my_typewriter_sound.aiff &'
23:47  zulax: thats for mac, on linux, i change afplay to aplay
23:47  zulax: and how to send the output to null? it just keeps beeping
23:48  homekevin: zulax: That's not making much sense to me.
23:48  zulax: this is cool http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4418364/how-can-i-make-vim-play-typewriter-sound-when-i-write-a-letter/4418605#4418605
23:48  homekevin: You want sound, but you don't want sound?
23:48  altamic: hello fellows, I use to mark my done items with a digraph: ^k + OK but now I can't remember the complimentary sign that is similar to an X, anyone remember the correct digraph? thank you
23:49  strull: altamic: try :dig  to look it up
23:49  zulax: homekevin, the instructions for linux say send to null, dont know what though
23:50  altamic: I have it in front of me, stil scrambling
23:51  homekevin: zulax: I'm sorry, I just don't know what your question is. It sounds like you are concerned that something needs to go to null but you don't know what.
23:52  zulax: homekevin, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4418364/how-can-i-make-vim-play-typewriter-sound-when-i-write-a-letter/4418605#4418605
23:52  Boohemian: Raimondi: thanks :)
23:52  zulax: so it does make sound, but the editor becomes weired after a sound
23:52  homekevin: zulax: I saw that already.
23:52  homekevin: We need more than "becomes weired"
