20:32 --- Channel #vim was synced in 68 seconds
20:52  jvv: hi, i know this is not vifm channel but vim... but maybe somebody uses it here... how can i start vifm so that dotfiles would be displayed from the beginning ?
21:06  fholgado: hi guys, how do I initialize an empty list?
21:18  tlp: I've got a vim script that says one of the keybindings is <s-a>. Not sure how to interpret that.
21:18  tlp: not "space a" apparently
21:19  fholgado: shift?
21:20  fholgado: whoops
21:20  fholgado: no
21:21  Miesco: How do you remove a tab file and the buffer?
21:21  Miesco: tabc?
21:21  Miesco: damn I forgot
21:22  FernandoBasso: Do you guys use to make summaries of what you learn?
21:23  FernandoBasso: Miesco: tabclose, bdelete, bwipeout
21:23  Miesco: bdelete makes my tabs go away
21:23  Miesco: Is that normal?
21:23  FernandoBasso: Yeah.
21:23  FernandoBasso: If it is the buffer you are current editing.
21:24  rindolf: Miesco: did you try :tabd ?
21:24  Miesco: rindolf: I thought it was tabc
21:24  rindolf: FernandoBasso: I'm using vim for summaries.
21:24  FernandoBasso: If in a tab, you are in buffer 2, and do :bw 3, then I think you don't close the tab 'accidentaly'.
21:24  rindolf: FernandoBasso: unless they are in Hebrew, when I use kate.
21:24  FernandoBasso: rindolf: How do you do? Could you show me something? A screenshot, or send me a file?
21:25  Miesco: It makes all my tabs go away if I do :bdelete
21:25  tlp: fholgado: ah, you were right. thanks for the guess :)
21:25  rindolf: FernandoBasso: what?
21:25  rindolf: FernandoBasso: of a summary?
21:26  FernandoBasso: Today, I accidentally deleted a directory where I used to kept all my summaries. They were a mess, some odt files, some txt, all unorganized. I am starting over...
21:26  rindolf: FernandoBasso: did you have backups?
21:26  FernandoBasso: rindolf: Yeah. Do you use any kind of formatting?
21:26  FernandoBasso: rindolf: No.
21:26  rindolf: FernandoBasso: well, nothing well-defined.
21:27  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: First thing to put in your new todo system ;-)
21:27  rindolf: FernandoBasso: * for bullets - for nested bullets indentation -------- for headers etc.
21:27  rudi_s: "Keep backups of everything"
21:27  FernandoBasso: They were just summaries. I didn't pay much attention. Now, I'm starting over, with folders, and everything well organized.
21:27  rindolf: rudi_s: yes, I agree.
21:27  FernandoBasso: When I needed to find some thing, I was not able to. They were almost useless in the way they were.
21:27  fholgado: guys, can I add a list to a list? or does something happen to it?
21:28  FernandoBasso: rindolf: Yes. Backup is important.
21:28  fholgado: docs says it's added as a single item, but not sure what that means...
21:28  FernandoBasso: rindolf: Would you mind show a screenshot?
21:28  rindolf: FernandoBasso: let me see if I have anything.
21:28  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: I just use plain text files in a AsciiDoc-like stype. Dates are stored in remind.
21:28  FernandoBasso: Any one else has ideas on formatting with vim only?
21:29  rudi_s: *style
21:29  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: If you want to share a screenshot, feel free. :)
21:30  FernandoBasso: I know there is nothing much on this, but....
21:31  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: No screenshot necessary, it's just a bullet point list.
21:31  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: For summaries? Do you write code snippets/examples in the summaries?
21:31  rudi_s: remind is a program to remind you of dates (quite sophisticated), it also uses a text file.
21:32  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: Sometimes, asciidoc can format them quite well.
21:33  rindolf: FernandoBasso: here's an old note called "Shell goodies" about readline - http://pastie.org/1407125
21:33  FernandoBasso: rindolf: Thanks. Let me see.
21:36  rindolf: rudi_s: where can I find remind?
21:36  FernandoBasso: rindolf: Well, kind of like I used to do.
21:36  FernandoBasso: I am also trying to use txtfmt.
21:37  rudi_s: rindolf: http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind/
21:37  rindolf: rudi_s: thanks.
21:37  rudi_s: np
21:53  FernandoBasso: Has anyone here tried using txtfmt already? If so, what did you think about it?
21:54  rindolf: FernandoBasso: I'm not familiar with txtfmt.

22:06  n00b_: i wish to make something like <a href="http://tulsidas.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/vim.jpg">this</a> in vim, but being a n00b is unable to do.. Please spare time to help mw
22:06  n00b_: http://tulsidas.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/vim.jpg
22:07  rindolf: n00b_: you need the NERDTree plugin.
22:07  n00b_: ok
22:07  homekevin: n00b_: You want to write Windows in Vim??
22:07  rindolf: n00b_: and a plugin to read tags.
22:07  n00b_: no
22:07  rindolf: n00b_: and display them.
22:07  n00b_: homekevin: no
22:07  n00b_: rindolf: so how to do that
22:07  rindolf: homekevin: it's a screenshot of gvim with certain configuration.
22:08  rindolf: n00b_: go to http://www.vim.org/
22:08  homekevin: I see that, but it's not clear from a screenshot what he or she wants to do
22:08  n00b_: homekevin: He,, I was willing o get the sidebars
22:08  homekevin: Especially since all the stuff in Vim is clearly already available for Vim.
22:10  n00b_: rindolf: is it tree..
22:10  rindolf: n00b_: what?
22:11  homekevin: I can sometimes be over-literal, so maybe that was the case when I assumed "make something like this" meant "develop"
22:11  n00b_: nerd tree
22:11  rindolf: n00b_: yes, you can find it there.
22:11  n00b_: rindolf: ya tree is already installed, so what to do now
22:11  rindolf: n00b_: type :NERDTree
22:16  n00b_: rindolf: It says it not an editor command
22:16  rindolf: n00b_: you should work on your English.
22:16  rindolf: n00b_: did you follow the instructions on installing NERDTree?
22:16  n00b_: rindolf: ya...
22:20 --- Araxia_ is now known as Araxia
22:20  tonymec: n00b_: check the output of :scriptnames for nerdtree.vim (or whatever), I'd expect it to be in a plugin/ subdirectory of some directory listed in 'runtimepath', but not in $VIMRUNTIME/plugin/
22:22  n00b_: tonymec: ok... i am putthing it in the PATH
22:23  tonymec: the Os's $PATH has nothing to do with it. Check ":set runtimepath?" without the quotes
22:23  n00b_: still unable to do
22:24  n00b_: ??
22:24  n00b_: tonymec: rindolf Still unable to do
22:26  tonymec: n00b_: maybe you didn't install it properly? reread your install instruction and double-check that you don't make typos
22:27  rindolf: n00b_: good luck with installing NERDTree. I'm going to sleep.
22:27  n00b_: rindolf: Good Nyt and Thanks
22:27  rindolf: n00b_: you're welcome.

22:39 --- Channel #vim was synced in 65 seconds
22:40  nvictor: hello all
22:40  nvictor: how do i uninstall a vba?
22:41  walt: you can't afaik
22:41  walt: I hate vba's
22:41  walt: it is the dumbest edition to vim by far
22:42  Raimondi: nvictor: See  :h RmVimball
22:42  nvictor: thanks
22:42  Raimondi: walt: Why is that?
22:43  walt: Raimondi: because it is pointless, dropping a plugin in a folder using pathogen is a magnitude simpler
22:43  walt: it's an extra layer of abstraction over something that doesn't need to be complicated at all
22:44  Raimondi: Yeah, the problem is that pathogen is not part of the Vim distribution
22:44  walt: then adding it instead of introducing vimballs would have been better
22:45  Raimondi: iirc, vimball is older than pathogen
22:45  Random832: is there a 64-bit independent version of the windows shell extension that works with 32-bit vim?
22:45  walt: then inventing pathogen would have been much better and simpler than inventing vimballs
22:45  walt: :)
22:46  Random832: or did they fix that
22:47  Raimondi: walt: besides, vimball can install/remove a plugin in a directory used by pathogen, they have different functions :)
22:47  walt: Raimondi: I can't think of a situation where I would want or have wanted vimballs
22:48  Raimondi: walt: That doesn't make it a bad tool ;)
22:48  walt: Raimondi: it does, because when people distribute things only as vimballs, I get into problems
22:49  Raimondi: walt: That's what I'm interested about, what kind of problems?
22:50  walt: I am probably just being ignorant. You said vimballs can install into pathogen dirs. I did not know this. But that has been my major issue
22:51  Raimondi: walt: :h :UseVimball
22:51  homekevin: Ah, vimballs.
22:51  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: Earlier we were talking about summaries: http://metabox.it/3jKp9.png
22:52  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: Looks good.
22:52  Raimondi: homekevin: Yeah, I always hear/read that vimball is pure shit, but never a good argument to sustent that those opinions...
22:53  Raimondi: Tat's why I'm curious about the problems it has...
22:53  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: I make those colors with txtfmt plugin, and just %TOhtml
22:54  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: Yeah. Personally I prefer plain ASCII (or UTF-8) though, hidden characters aren't such a good idea IMHO. (I prefer Asciidoc which uses *xxx* for bold for example, or _underlined_, etc.)
22:56  walt: Raimondi: I am exaggerating my hate. But my core point is that I simply don't see a reason for them, and that I have haad even slight problems with them
22:56  walt: i.e they are a feature I never needed that has given me annoyance
22:57  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: I don't disagree with you. I think you have a good point here. But it is nice that vim is able to colorize in whatever way we like a plain text file (if we want/need/like, etc), isn't it. Also, of course that can be viewed in vim alone. I just converted to html to see the results.
22:58  rudi_s: FernandoBasso: Yeah, the plugin is really good for that. With the latest vim it got even better (as you don't need a separator char between words anymore).
22:59  Raimondi: walt: One of the arguments that I've seen on its favor, is that vimballs are supported whenever Vim is installed, which is not the case of zip, tar, etc. I know that might not be an issue for most people, but for some it is.
22:59  FernandoBasso: rudi_s: Sure. Those 'extra spaces' were annoying.
22:59  homekevin: Sure, if it actually installs properly.
23:00  homekevin: We had a dude in here a week or two back that inflated a vimball and ended up with 700 empty files, each named with a line from the vimball file.
23:00  rudi_s: Raimondi: My main problem is that installs in the wrong directory if you change the 'rtp'.
23:01  rudi_s: And I can't easily extract it (without installing), like a zip, or tar file.
23:01  Raimondi: rudi_s: You can  :h :UseVimball
23:02  rudi_s: Raimondi: Ah, nice. Didn't know the [path] option. Thanks.
23:02  Raimondi: homekevin: I agree that would be problematic.
23:25  Raimondi: Besides the other vi clones, are there other text editors that went the modal way?
23:25  mail: e
23:25  mail: recently
23:28  gkatsev: isn't yi modal?
23:30  sir_lewk: it really depends on how precisely you define modal
23:30  Raimondi: e has a nice feature I'd like on Vim, the one that restricts commands to syntax regions.
23:30  sir_lewk: if you define it too tightly the you'll end up only including vi-clones by definition.  with sufficiently loose definitions emacs fits though.
23:33  FernandoBasso: Are netrw and Explore the same?
23:36  fow: FernandoBasso, netrw is the plugin that provides :Explore, yes
23:36  FernandoBasso: fow: So, :Explore, is a plugin, provided by other plugin?
23:37 --- Araxia_ is now known as Araxia
23:37  fow: err, I thought you were referring to the Vim command :Explore, which is provided by netrw
23:37  fow: I was not aware of some other plugin named Explore
23:38  FernandoBasso: fow: I really mean :Explore that ship *with* vim by default.
23:38  fow: ah, okay. yes, that's provided by netrw
23:39  FernandoBasso: I think I misunderstood. :Explore is not a plugin alone. It is part of the features provided by the netrw plugin.
23:39  fow: yes
23:40  FernandoBasso: Thanks.
23:41  FernandoBasso: I might be wrong, but it seems that xterm is rendering fonts even better than gvim. Strange.
