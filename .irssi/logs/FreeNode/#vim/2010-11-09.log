10:10  twoface: Hi. What should I write in my .vimrc to alter what characters in considered word characters? I would like to exclude ".", but include "-" (at least for some filetypes)
10:12  fow: twoface, :h 'isk'
10:16  twoface: great, thanks - i was looking for the term 'word characters' instead :)
10:18  fow: you're welcome
10:18  MagusOTB: is there a way to force vim to highlight files as different languages than it thinks they are?
10:19  MagusOTB: i.e. I want something.js.php to be highlited as a Javascript file rather than a PHP file.
10:19  Jerub: MagusOTB: :set filetype=php
10:32  samlt: hello, I'm trying to search backward for an IP address which is not 192.168.20.171, how do I do that? '?192.168.20.???'
10:33  Jerub: samlt: that's more or less impossible
10:33  Jerub: samlt: perhaps you should just remove all lines containingthe ip you don't want:P
10:33  Jerub: :d/192.168.20.171/d
10:33  Jerub: er
10:33  Jerub: :g/192.168.20.171/d
10:34  samlt: Jerub, yeah, that's what I was doing, just though I should ask if there was an other way! Thank anyway:)
10:35  Jerub: ooh, just occurred to me
10:35  Jerub: youcould do somethingwith :v/192.168.20.171/g/192.168/p
10:35  Jerub: or something...
10:38  samlt: Jerub,  Cannot do :global recursive :/ ;)
10:39  Jerub: you can usea let
10:39  Jerub: to set thelinenumber

12:24  Shrat: Hello everyone. I saw that you can tell vim not to connect to the X server using the -X option. Will it accelerate the redraw or it's only a matter of startup time? Thanks.
12:31  spiiph: Startup only..
12:33  iaj: a little bit confusing at first when one got rnu set- 3 dd actually deletes to the -2- below... ;)
12:45  strull: use 3dj or d3j then
12:47  iaj: you'r right strull I shall get used to that one
12:49  strull: the advantage is, that d3k goes in the other direction
12:51  iaj: strull: so you tend to use it that way?
13:10  Shrat: Hello everyone. I saw that you can tell vim not to connect to the X server using the -X option. Will it accelerate the redraw or it's only a matter of startup time? Thanks.
13:12  iaj: how can I complete from all occurences in the current buffer that start with # ?
13:13  krisfremen: Shrat: start up time is faster, but you won't be able to access the clipboard
13:13  Shrat: wellâ€¦ I don't care about the clipboard. Guess I should get rid of that connection
13:16  deryni: I think startup time is likely to be unaffected on a local connection and will likely only be affected when the X display isn't actually there or is remote, but you could test it and find out easily enough in your situation.
13:21  iaj: is there some way to have a css validation in vim?
13:21  jamessan: Shrat: it only speeds up startup time if there's information in your environment that says Vim can connect to an X session, but that information isn't accurate
13:29  heeen: is it possible to jump to a file in the quickfix window using the cursor
13:30  heeen: instead of using cnext until you have the right line
13:31  kurkale6ka: yeah, hit enter
13:33  _rane: anyone use MacVim and know how I can get rid of GUI warnings about changed files?
13:34  _rane: you can only control those dialogs with mouse so it's super annoying
13:34  Dynetrekk: _rane: you can control those dialogs with the keyboard. use tab and space :)
13:35  _rane: doesnt' work
13:35  Dynetrekk: _rane: It does for me?
13:35  _rane: on latest MacVim at least
13:35  Dynetrekk: hm
13:35  _rane: co-worker complained as well
13:35  _rane: that they stopped working
13:35  Dynetrekk: what is your value of
13:35  iaj: _rane: im using 7.3 macvim.. i can use the commandline for such things
13:35  Dynetrekk: latest? mine i 7.3.(55)
13:35  heeen: kurkale6ka: that just tells me the buffer is unmodifiable
13:36  _rane: 7.3 (53) ...
13:36  _rane: meh, I can't control it with keyboard
13:36  et: _rane: system preferences -> keyboard & mouse -> keyboard shortcuts
13:36  Dynetrekk: _rane: upgrade to the latest and use the keyboard then?
13:37  heeen: mh. might be my cr remapping
13:37  et: it doesn't have anything to do with the version
13:37  kurkale6ka: heeen: so you click in the qfix win, then enter and it says that?
13:37  kurkale6ka: heeen: yes, most like
13:37  Dynetrekk: et: aha, it's the osx rules for how you use the keyboard in dialogs?
13:37  et: osx has an option for keyboard controls only switching between text fields and all controls
13:37  _rane: lol, so I've accidentally pressed CTRL-F7
13:37  _rane: and that setting has changed
13:40  heeen: I have nmap <CR> i<CR>
13:40  heeen: doh!
13:41  heeen: au BufReadPost quickfix nunmap <CR>
13:59  iaj: can I have an autocommand for when I delete a certain BuffeR?
13:59  heeen: mh
14:00  heeen: can I have a key mapping only be in one buffer
14:00  strull: heeen: sure. :map <buffer> ....
14:01  heeen: au BufReadPost quickfix nunmap <buffer> <CR>
14:01  heeen: ?
14:03  jamessan: heeen: that's not a key mapping. that's a key unmapping
14:03  heeen: yeah
14:03  heeen: but should be the same, right?
14:03  jamessan: no
14:04  jamessan: you could "nnoremap <CR> <CR>" for the quickfix window
14:04  jamessan: well, with the <buffer> argument
14:04  jamessan: or you could map your <CR> behavior to a different key

14:16  rical: 166         match extraChars /\%>80v/
14:16  rical: something like match extraChars /\%>%{max_chars}v/

15:57  deryni: Do you have modelines turned on?
15:57  filosofo: Hello, is there a way to set height of a window pane in vim to a specific amount?  Say 10 lines tall.

15:59  kurkale6ka: no, # vim: noexpandtab: is not correct
15:59  kurkale6ka: filosofo: z10 enter
15:59  caio: I have "set modeline" in my vim.rc, and vim: noexpandtab: didnt work
15:59  filosofo: kurkale6ka, awesome, thanks.  Is there a vertical equivalent?

16:01  caio: .vimrc sorry :)
16:01  the_isz: caio: oh, forgot:   # vim: set noexpandtab:
16:01  deryni: Does ':set modeline?' say modeline?

16:16  tinsolder: Hey, I have a question about the omnicomplete python functionality.
16:16  tinsolder: function information shows up in a scratch/preview buffer, below the pane that i'm working on.  Is it possible to set up a buffer in a pane of my choosing that will capture this information?
16:18  tinsolder: In other words, my screen is very wide, and I don't use the entire width.  But I do use the entire height.  I'd like the scratch buffer to be _beside_ my working pane, instead of below it.
16:25  kurkale6ka: rical: not sure but maybe you should use :exe... exe 'match...' . '/' . g:bla
16:27  tinsolder: Ah, I worked it out.
16:27  tinsolder: Open a new pane, then use:
16:28  tinsolder: :setlocal previewwindow ro nomodifiable nomodified
16:30  PlasmaHH: hi, following some advice from yesterday to profile I started profiling with ":profile start prof.log" however when I now exit vim, the file is empty... is there anything I am missing?
16:30 * creidiki uninstalls vimperator
16:32  dsetchell: Hi all, new to vim so general apology if this is a RTFM question.  Is there a way to get the filename of the currently active buffer from a function?
16:32  estragib: dsetchell: :h c_%
16:34  dsetchell: estragib: so in a function i can, `let foo = %`
16:34  dsetchell: that doesn't seem to work for me
16:34  estragib: you could use expand there

16:42  pigdude: what's an easy way to double-space some lines?
16:44  iaj: pigdude: :set sw=2       select the lines and > ?
16:44  iaj: or <C-V> 10j (for 10 lines)  I<space><space><ESC>
16:45  iaj: sorry 0<C-V>
16:45  pigdude: iaj: oh, I'm sorry, I was not referring to indentation
16:45  pigdude: iaj: rather, I am thinking of line spacing
16:45  kurkale6ka: pigdude: :g/^/norm o
16:46  consumerism: how can i grep all buffers for a string?
16:46  kurkale6ka: consumerism: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2545
16:46  pigdude: kurkale6ka: thanks, I didn't even know I could use that technique
16:46  pigdude: kurkale6ka: I think I'll have a lot of fun with that
16:47  kurkale6ka: pigdude: :g/^/pu=''
16:47  kurkale6ka: pigdude: many ways to do that :)
16:47  pigdude: kurkale6ka: hehe that is clever
16:47  pigdude: kurkale6ka: yea, I never use :g/ day to day, I think I'll try and use it now
16:48  pigdude: thanks kurkale6ka!
16:48  kurkale6ka: np pigdude, :g is very powerfull
16:48  iaj: what's the pu='' part doing?
16:48  pigdude: iaj: it puts that
16:48  strull: the one thing :g misses is recursiveness
16:48  pigdude: iaj: it puts a blank line, since '' is empty
16:49  pigdude: iaj: if you did 'abc' it would be a line w/ 'abc', :h pu
16:49  iaj: never heard of that put command :)
16:49  kurkale6ka: :h:pu
16:49  pigdude: strull: what do you mean by that?
16:49  pigdude: strull: as the global transformations I perform tend to be very conservative, I probably would never even attempt something like that
16:50  strull: pigdude: something like :g/foo/g/bar/..... is not possible
16:50  strull: it yields e147
16:51  pigdude: strull: what do you expect that to do?
16:51  pigdude: strull: oh, I understand now
16:51  kurkale6ka: :g/.*foo\&.*bar?
16:51  pigdude: strull: yes, that would be nice to have I suppose
16:51  pigdude: kurkale6ka: I agree, usu a way to express w/ regex
16:53  iaj: what's the difference between .*foo\&.*bar and .*foo.*bar$, is there any?
16:53  kurkale6ka: yes, in the latter you won't get lines like bar.....foo
16:54  iaj: ahhh I get it now, thakns kurkale6ka 
16:54  gkatsev: :h regex
16:54  gkatsev: :h /\&

17:11  AlexMax: How do I nest colorschemes?
17:11  cryptic0: oh my god, I just opened my homework .tex file in vim, and it says a swap file already exists.  When I click recover, the last 3 questions from the homework file are missing.  I had saved it and also created pdf, how come I have lost 3 questions?
17:12  AlexMax: MacVim has an issue with cleared colorschemes.  If you use hi clear, there is no dark background color scheme at all.
17:12  AlexMax: So I want to load the 'default' macvim colorscheme and then put mine on top.
17:13  AlexMax: cryptic0: The swap file is out of date probably...you might have another vim session open somewhere or maybe vim simply did not delete it for whatever reason.
17:13  AlexMax: as long as you didn't save, you're good
17:14  cryptic0: AlexMax:  so what should I do to get back my file?
17:15  cryptic0: Edit anyway?
17:15  AlexMax: quit, don't save
17:15  AlexMax: delete the swap file
17:15  AlexMax: (or rename it to be safe)
17:15  AlexMax: open your file again
17:15  cryptic0: oh ok, let me try
17:16  cryptic0: ah, thanks a lot.  that worked. should keep that in mind from now on.
