22:05 --- Query: Starting query with mcantor on FreeNode
22:05 iaj: lo there
22:05 iaj: may I ask you a question :)
22:06 mcantor: Absolutely!
22:09 iaj: heh, cool :-) Im currently finding out a good setup on howto do completions... like.. do you use <C-N> <C-P> or have you some plugin for that in use?
22:09 mcantor: There's a fairly nice omnicomplete function that ships with vim nowadays, but the inconsistency bugs me
22:10 iaj: hmmm... so how do you act?
22:13 mcantor: right now I mostly shake my fist at the sky.  :-(  I haven't figured out an ideal setup yet, but you should definitely peruse the docs for ":he ins-completion"; it details every single built-in completion ability that vim has
22:15 mcantor: I've actually e-mailed the dev AND user lists with some questions & ideas, and literally no one responded :-(
22:16 iaj: Oh... ok... ohwell yeah... so but you don't use supertab or stuff like that at all right :)?
22:17 mcantor: no; right now, literally the only plugin i use is VCSCommand... i'm very stingy about using plugins
22:17 mcantor: what does supertab do, again?  rofl
22:17 iaj: haha.. well it tries to find out which completion you wanna use.. that you basically have only tab to press for completion
22:18 mcantor: that's odd... i_<CTRL-N> does that
22:18 mcantor: you can populate the 'complete' option with the sources you want
22:18 mcantor: if you really need tab, you can just remap i_<Tab> to i_<CTRL-N>
22:19 iaj: yeah im just bugging around with that.. hehe
22:19 iaj: i shall get used to C-N right?
22:19 mcantor: yeah; it's quite flexible
22:19 iaj: well the problem is I tried supertab
22:19 iaj: but when Im doing codecompletion with lots of classes open
22:19 iaj: it sometimes takes ages (because it brwoses through all the code completion stuff)
22:19 iaj: even tho if I simply wanna use C-P basically
22:20 iaj: I guess one uses <C-P> in insert mode more often than <C-N>
22:20 mcantor: yeah, vim has some heuristics to try and handle that... check out ":he i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I"
22:20 mcantor: or ":he compl-keyword"
22:20 mcantor: (same thing)
22:21 mcantor: i bet you could get a very fast & usable completion by dynamically setting 'path' or 'include'.
22:21 mcantor: I think what happened is that over time, people had many different ideas for solutions
22:21 iaj: actually sometimes its weird that those <C-N> and <C-P> browse through all the 
22:21 mcantor: and Vim represents about 5 different incomplete solutions... LOL
22:21 iaj: heh
22:21 iaj: yeah maybe
22:21 iaj: im trying to find one that I'm most comfortable with
22:21 iaj: I'm using eclim in order to do some java coding
22:22 iaj: so I mapped C-Space to <C-x><C-u> actually - which is the usercompletion - eclipse' ones.
22:22 mcantor: yeah... it should be less of an issue in static languages, because you can unambiguously resolve tags without the use of an interpreter
22:25 iaj: vim is just so amazing
22:26 mcantor: it is!  i love it.  i hate text editing, but vim makes me hate it less.
22:26 iaj: hihi... eyah... I'm actually trying to replace everything by it
22:26 mcantor: yeah, i find myself using it increasingly even for stuff like word processing
22:27 iaj: heh.. yeah :)
22:33 iaj: ah I like the completeopt=longest,menuone :)

22:58 mcantor: what's 'menuone' do?
23:01 iaj: heh showing a menu - even if theres only one completion - useful for coding where you want to see what paramters a function uses...
