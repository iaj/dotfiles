16:18 iaj: lo ther
16:19 mcantor: Greetings!
16:19 iaj: Hey mate :)
16:19 iaj: Have you been using tidy ?
16:19 iaj: I just grabbed it.. load up the html file
16:19 iaj: and do :!tidy
16:19 iaj: that's the way of doing it, I think?
16:19 mcantor: :.!tidy should work.
16:19 iaj: whats the . for?
16:19 mcantor: The dot's important; it means "act only on this line."
16:19 mcantor: You may also get better results with :.!tidy -xml
16:23 iaj: hmmmm
16:23 iaj: my line is actually looking like that
16:23 iaj: http://pastebin.com/tmgDbgHj
16:23 iaj: but it doesn't seem to be working correctly on that one :(
16:24 mcantor: Yeah... you'll have to dig into the tidy manpage.
16:24 mcantor: Sorry :-\
16:24 iaj: np :)
16:24 iaj: Thanks!
16:25 mcantor: No prob!
