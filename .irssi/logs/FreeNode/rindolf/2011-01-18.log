21:33 iaj: hey there. you up?
21:33 rindolf: Hi.
21:33 rindolf: I'm fine.
21:33 rindolf: Yes, I'm up.
21:33 iaj: I finally got into testing your Makefile thing:)  When I do a lftp -e 'put bla.txt' ftp://ftp.myserver.com/
21:33 iaj: where does it take user/pass from?
21:33 rindolf: iaj it doesn't.
21:33 iaj: I got it specified in .netrc for vim but I doubt that's sufficient :)
21:34 iaj: i need to ftp://user:pass@ ?
21:34 rindolf: iaj: you need to specify it somehow.
21:34 rindolf: You can.
21:34 rindolf: As long as your makefile is kept secret.
21:36 iaj: Ahh, ok thanks.. wow quite a large man page that 'lftp' has got.
21:36 iaj: Do you use many of those Makefiles?
21:37 rindolf: I have written many makefiles
21:37 rindolf: Or generated them.
21:38 iaj: Wohhoo its actually using .netrc
21:38 iaj: Still its not working ;(
21:39 rindolf: Ah.

22:00 rindolf: Did you try adding the credentials to the command line?
22:01 iaj: I got it set up now
22:01 iaj: It really uses .netrc
22:01 rindolf: Nice.
22:01 iaj: But one has to specify  lftp ftp.server.org  only
22:01 rindolf: How strange.
