19:45 --- Query: Starting query with rindolf on FreeNode
19:45 iaj: hey, could you mb pastebin a examplefile on a file foobar.txt uploaded to ftp://myserver.com/foo/foo/ and overwriting any previous files?
19:46 rindolf: Yes.
19:46 rindolf: Wait a sec.
19:47 iaj: Thank you:)
19:49 rindolf: http://pastie.org/1460980 # Untested.
19:49 rindolf: You can also use a shell script.
19:51 iaj: Thanks... I didn't even have the lftp script :D
19:52 iaj: did you upload to pastie by hand or used a command line tool?
19:52 rindolf: It's not a script.
19:52 rindolf: Well, I copy and pasted.
19:52 iaj: s/script/tool
19:52 iaj: sorry about that
19:52 iaj: where could I obtain informations about that Makefile stuff?
19:52 rindolf: There may be some make tutorials on the web.
19:53 rindolf: I don't recall how I learnt make exactly.
19:53 iaj: Oh.. mhh... 
19:53 iaj: I just saw
19:53 iaj: i need to 'make upload' now?
19:53 rindolf: Yes.
19:54 rindolf: You can also invoke it from vim using :make upload
19:57 iaj: dont i need to do :!make upload?
19:57 iaj: and I guess I need to be on the same directory for it to work correct?
19:59 rindolf: :help :make
19:59 rindolf: Yes.
19:59 rindolf: Well, you can create a wrapper makefile that will call the top-level one.
20:03 iaj: like how? :-)  heh sorry for bugging you
20:06 rindolf: Learn make properly.
20:06 rindolf: Or ask on ##toolchain or something.
20:09 iaj: hmm ok.. so basically the file is just all: (if just invoked make all)  and upload: make upload
20:09 iaj: and I can then enter commands like I would in a shell script
20:09 rindolf: The all target is the default target.
20:10 iaj: Ok :-)
