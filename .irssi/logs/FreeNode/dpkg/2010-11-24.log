16:10 --- Query: Starting query with dpkg on FreeNode
16:10 dpkg: abrotman wants you to know: You can use lspci, lsusb, lsscsi, lspcmcia, lshal, hwinfo, dmidecode, and/or lshw, or even dmesg to find out what kind of hardware your machine might have, or you could crack the lid and look inside ... oooh, shiny!  If you install lshw, run "lshw -html > myhardware.html" as root and you'll have a nice HTML summation.  See also <myram>, <driver locator>.

17:32 iaj: etch sources.list
17:32 dpkg: rumour has it, etch sources.list is "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free" and "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security etch/updates main contrib non-free".  But realise that Etch has not had security support since February 2010 and that you should upgrade to a newer release.  Ask me about <etch->lenny>.

17:40 dpkg: Read the release notes, ask me about <lenny release notes>.  Ensure your Etch installation is up to date, ask me about <etch sources.list> (aptitude update; aptitude dist-upgrade).  Then ask me about <lenny sources.list>.  aptitude update; aptitude install aptitude; aptitude safe-upgrade; aptitude full-upgrade.  Also ask me about <apt-listbugs>, <etch->lenny key>.
17:43 iaj: lenny sources.list
17:43 dpkg: The list of repositories for installing packages is /etc/apt/sources.list and has lines like "deb http://ftp.CC.debian.org/debian lenny main" and "deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main" where CC is your country code.  Be sure to run "aptitude update" after editing sources.list.  Also see <mirrors> <apt-spy> <lenny security> <testing security> "man sources.list" and /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list
