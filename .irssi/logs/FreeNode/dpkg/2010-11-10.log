10:26 [msg(dpkg)] etch->lenny
10:26 --- Query: Starting query with dpkg on FreeNode
10:26 dpkg: Read the release notes, ask me about <lenny release notes>.  Ensure your Etch installation is up to date, ask me about <etch sources.list> (aptitude update; aptitude dist-upgrade).  Then ask me about <lenny sources.list>.  aptitude update; aptitude install aptitude; aptitude safe-upgrade; aptitude full-upgrade.  Also ask me about <apt-listbugs>, <etch->lenny key>.
10:26 iaj: etch sources.list
10:26 dpkg: from memory, etch sources.list is "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free" and "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security etch/updates main contrib non-free".  But realise that Etch has not had security support since February 2010 and that you should upgrade to a newer release.  Ask me about <etch->lenny>.
10:27 iaj: lenny sources.list
10:27 dpkg: The list of repositories for installing packages is /etc/apt/sources.list and has lines like "deb http://ftp.<cc>.debian.org/debian lenny main" and "deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main" where <cc> is your country code.  Be sure to run "aptitude update" after editing sources.list.  Also see <mirrors> <apt-spy> <lenny security> <testing security> "man sources.list" and /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/sources.list
