10:08 --- Query: Starting query with dpkg on FreeNode
10:08 dpkg: cutmeownthroat wants you to know: In lenny and squeeze, create/edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local.conf and add a line similar to this (without quotes): "blacklist module_name".  If this doesn't work, do 'echo "install modulename /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local.conf'.  IMPORTANT: ask about <blacklist-initramfs>.  To blacklist a module at installation time, ask me about <installer blacklist>.  http://wiki.debian.org/KernelModuleBlacklisting

12:45 [msg(dpkg)] etch sources.list
12:45 --- Query: Starting query with dpkg on FreeNode
12:45 dpkg: it has been said that etch sources.list is "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free" and "deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security etch/updates main contrib non-free".  But realise that Etch has not had security support since February 2010 and that you should upgrade to a newer release.  Ask me about <etch->lenny>.

13:49 dpkg: babilen wants you to know: Lenny users: To change your console keymap, run "dpkg-reconfigure console-data".  To change your X keymap, read "man xmodmap", ask me about <drxx>, use kcontrol, gnome-control-center or similar.  For setting up X keymaps, also check out xkeycaps, xev and ask me about <multimedia keys>.  In console you can also use "loadkeys" for once-only/temporary adjustments.  Squeeze users: "dpkg-reconfigure console-setup" for both console and X.
