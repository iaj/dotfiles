00:12  plugwash: has anyone ever tried running 100base-TX over short runs of flat telephone style cable
00:13  plugwash: and if so how well/badly did it work?
00:14  lupine_85: not tried, but cat5 is good for 100m
00:14  lupine_85: I'm sure poor-quality cable could do a short distance
00:15  plugwash: mmm, i'm thinking much the same
00:16  plugwash: basically I have a situation where for reasons i'm not going to get into I need a cable to come out of a peice of equipment and then immediately do a U turn and I don't think cat5 is flexible enough
00:16  plugwash: but the total run will be under half a meter
00:18  stakkars: context: OS X 10.6.5 connecting to windows 7.
00:18  lupine_85: I've never had real problems with cat5's flexibility
00:18  stakkars: by default, OS X will not see any Windsows 7 shares in the Finder,
00:19  stakkars: although connecting with "go to server" "smb://ip_or_name" works.
00:20  wolfric: plugwash: try it out i'd be interested in seeing if it works or not. Main problem with that is interference. In cat 5 the wires are twisted at different rates which means the magnetic interference coming off them isn't likely to interfere with eachother. On the shielded side of things those very few are actually shielded and even fewer propperly set up grounded nodes on either side
00:21  stakkars: this problem is reported for "Vista" as well, while WinXP does work without problems.
00:21  Shambat: stakkars: what is your actual problem?
00:22  stakkars: I am looking for a better solution than to:
00:23  stakkars: 1. run "secpol" and relax the protocol requirements
00:24  stakkars: 2. edit /private/etc/smb.conf and make the Mac a browser master.
00:25  stakkars: after that, all windows clients must be shut down, and OS X restarted, to make sure that OS X
00:26  stakkars: becomes the browser master. From then on, it works.
00:26  stakkars: I want to improve that.
00:29  tomeo: hi
00:30  Shambat: hi
00:32  tomeo: Im having a strange problem. I have three computers, all use the same router/modem from my ISP to connect to the internet. 2 of them are working fine, the third was working fine... however since a few days ago it the internet connection has been jumping up and down on it. Strange thing is that if Im on a Skype call that doesnt stop working, but I cant browse the web or ping any domains. That led me to believe it was a
00:32  tomeo: DNS-problem, however Im using the same DNS as the other two computers which work all the time. Any suggestions on what could be wrong? (Heres what it looks like when I ping google for example http://pastie.org/1348258)
00:32 +xand: what about pinging the router.
00:33  tomeo: xand: that works fine, and the webbserver running on it for config is running well too
00:34  tomeo: no wait, sorry, xand... I actually get the same behavior pinging the router
00:34  tomeo: hmm
00:34  Shambat: bad cable?
00:34 +xand: is it wireless?
00:34  tomeo: Shambat: tried two different 1 week old cables
00:34  tomeo: xand: only wired
00:34 +xand: maybe the network card is dodgy
00:34 +xand: or the port it's connected to on the router
00:35 +xand: does it do the same pinging another PC from that one?
00:35 +xand: (assuming the other PC's firewall allows it)
00:36  Shambat: those are kind of high ms times for the ones that do work.
00:37  tomeo: xand: I can ping my other computer without a problem, but the ping running to the router is working fine now too
00:37  tomeo: 0-5ms
00:37 +xand: er... ok
00:38  tomeo: is there any way to determine wether the NIC is bad?
00:39 +xand: process of deduction
00:39 +xand: and elimination
00:39  Shambat: tomeo: could you try changing the ports on the router? try switching a good PC with the bad PC and see what happens
00:40  tomeo: Shambat: I only have one cable running from the router, and that leads to a switch. Ill try switching the ports in the switch. brb
00:54  tomeo: hi again
00:54  tomeo: same problem
00:54  tomeo: and I couldnt get it running again
00:54  tomeo: so I switched to wireless
00:55  tomeo: which is actually having similar problems
00:55 +xand: o.O
00:55 +xand: what OS do you have on there
00:55  tomeo: and afaik they are two separate NICs
00:55  tomeo: OSX
00:55 --- em is now known as emma
00:55  tomeo: its an iMac
00:56 +xand: hm
01:01  Shambat: tomeo: so, to be clear: one of your machines is having problems wit TCP connections? this machine has unstable pings and the problem follows the machine, and not the port it's connected to ... for some reason, the same behavior occurs when using wireless on that machine.
01:02  tomeo: Shambat: its not AS bad using wireless
01:02  tomeo: Shambat: otherwise yes
01:02 +xand: not sure what to do with OS X
01:03  tomeo: I have windows XP on vmware if that helps
01:06 +xand: well that'd still rely on OS X underneath... a better test would be to boot from an ubuntu cd or something and see if that works properly or not
01:07  Shambat: Genius Bar?  - _ -
01:07  tomeo: xand: osx is unix based, I may have or be able to get whatever tools youd suggest in my terminal
01:07 +xand: well there are os x channels on here
01:07 +xand: tomeo: I know it is, but don't have any tools to suggest - the point is to see if the problem goes away in another OS :)
01:08  tomeo: xand: thats a very good point
01:08  tomeo: xand: if it does, what could be wrong?
01:08  tomeo: is osx screwing up the application layer somehow?
01:08 +xand: I don't know
01:09  tomeo: Shambat: we dont have genius bars in Sweden :(
01:10  Shambat: are the other machines OSX?
01:10  tomeo: Shambat: one is, one is freebsd
01:12 --- emma is now known as em
01:14  Shambat: I wonder if all NICs share the same TCP stack ...
01:14  Shambat: wifi/ethernet
01:16  xylox: tomeo what about MTU? sometimes that can produce random network problems
01:17  tomeo: xylox: can I even change that?
01:18  xylox: before change it, take a look what value it has, ifconfig in a terminal will show
01:18  Shambat: yeah it could be that the machine is setup to use jumbo packets
01:18 --- KindTwo is now known as KindOne
01:19  Shambat: which are more than 1500 bytes for ethernet
01:19  Shambat: I mean, default is 1500 bytes, but jumbo frames could be more...
01:19  tomeo: Shambat: my NIC doesnt support jumbo
01:19  tomeo: en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
01:20  xylox: and the mtu of you router/isp?
01:20  tomeo: xylox: Im sorry, but I dont know how to check that
01:21  xylox: log in your router, there should be some info about that
01:21  lupine_85: pmtu discovery should do the trick
01:21  lupine_85: there's a tool for it in the repos
01:21  lupine_85: scamper
01:23  xylox: or easier is to check if the other computers that haven't problems have that same value, if so, you can discard that then
01:27  tomeo: xylox: they do
01:27  tomeo: re0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
01:28  tomeo: is from my freebsd-computer

12:03  learningC: yes, it on already
12:04  learningC: does an application have to be NAT compatible or something?
12:05  Shambat: what is the app?
12:05 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 166 seconds
12:06  learningC: it's an ip chat program, it has 2 parts, the server and the client
12:06  learningC: the server would listen on port 8084 tcp
12:07  learningC: and the client would sent at the ip you specify to port 8084 tcp
12:07  learningC: they connect fine over non-NAT
12:08  learningC: but when I put my computer behind a router, they won't connect anymore
12:09  learningC: could it be because there is a special feature that is required in a software to deal with NAT?
12:10  Shambat: if the only port being used is 8084, and this is forwarded to the right machine, then it should be ok
12:10 --- CMI-DOS_Zzzzz is now known as CMI-DOS
12:11  learningC: I tried on 2 different routers and I'm not able to connect despite disabling firewallls and port forward
12:11  learningC: is there any other option that would prevent the connection?
12:16  Shambat: learningC: are you sure 8084 is the only port?
12:19  learningC: yes, it's the only port, that's what it says on the application header
12:22  learningC: is a NAT transparent?
12:25 --- ChanServ sets modes [##networking +v Sargun]
12:25  learningC: for example, if my server ip is 192.168.1.100 and the client is 69.10.10.10

13:02  ovrflw0x: what does 102.12.122.12/12 mean/
13:02  ovrflw0x: ?
13:02  ovrflw0x: what does 102.12.122.12/12 mean?
13:02  lupine_85: ipcalc will tell you
13:02  ovrflw0x: why is there a forward slash?
13:02  lupine_85: that's the netmask
13:02  ovrflw0x: are 12 number of bits?
13:03  ovrflw0x: my router gives ip address from 192.168.1.100 and max users are 10 so what will the address with a "slash" be?
13:03  ovrflw0x: 192.168.1.100/10?
13:05  lupine_85:  /32 = netmask of 255.255.255.255, /24 = netmask of 255.255.255.0
13:06  ovrflw0x: lupine_85-->  so?
13:06  ovrflw0x: it should be 24?
13:06  ovrflw0x: 192.168.1.100/24
13:06  ovrflw0x: my netmask ends with 0
13:06  Greeksta: /24 is a class c
13:07  Greeksta: 255 hosts
13:07  lupine_85: it's a method of splitting the address into network & host parts
13:15 +xand: (note: classes are no longer used)
13:17  Greeksta: classes are no longer used?
13:20  lupine_85: mm, you don't get a class C any more
13:20  lupine_85: you get a /24
13:20  lupine_85: if you're really lucky
13:21  lupine_85: most will get a /27 or smaller, of course
13:21 +xand: Greeksta: yes, not since ... mid 1990s
13:23  OmNomSequitur: I should have asked for a /8 in 1989.
13:23  OmNomSequitur: I was three at the time, but I should've thought ahead.

13:52  Shambat: ovrflw0x: if your router says 10 users max, does not necessarily reflact on the size of the netmask
14:00  Idol_Mind: anyone know if it is possible to embed a website address into a widget on the desktop?
14:00 +xand: CMI-DOS: that's quite enough of that.
14:00  Shambat: ovrflw0x: but if you want to find the subnet mask for 10 hosts, plus broadcast and network addresses, thats 12 addresses in the subnet ... how many bits do you need to represent 12? 1100 binary = 12 decimal ... so 4 bits ... 32 - 4 = 28 ... netmask will be 255.255.255.240 or /28   .... this subnet actually holds 16 adresses

17:45  AgentCarmichael: If one is on ventrilo on someone's server, says something and waits for the other to say something back, sees he doesn't say anything but notices the ping raises from 108 to 308, does that mean the person on the other side just did something on his computer or does that mean vent was sending my voice over to the server?

18:22  infid: how come when i disconnect from my vpn (i'm using ubuntu's NetworkManager), when i type 'route' it shows:  <ip of VPN Server>  home            255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 eth0
18:22  infid: yet ifconfig no longer shows ppp0
18:22  infid: i can tell i'm not still connected in the sense that the internal IPs of the vpn no longer work, but why does it show up in the routing table at all
18:42  ns44: hi
18:42  ns44: "syn" she said, and i could not take my eyes off of her overflowing headers with more than 20 bytes. "ack" i replied. "syn ack syn ack rst fin" oh god, her ports were open, i fingered her on port 79 and smtp'd her glorious 25 port. my packets were oozing into those open ports, the glorious tcp flow came to a climax with a final fin
18:42  ns44: i had to write hat, because when i googled for tcp/ip fan fiction nothing came up
18:46  daemonkeeper: omg
18:50  infid: i changed my DHCP IP range from 192.x.x.x to 172.x.x.x but my att&t u-verse 2wire router's ip is 192.168.1.254 and now i can't even ping that ip or long into the web interface. Is there a 172.x.x.x ip it should be at now or what?
18:51  daemonkeeper: It should be in that range, yes. Otherwise you'd have to fiddle around a bit.
18:52  daemonkeeper: You have to configure it on your own to be there though
18:53  infid: so i guess i should nmap myself to figure out what 172 is open
18:54  daemonkeeper: Your router will still be at 192.168.1.254 unless you configured otherwise (you didn't by changing DHCP range)
18:55  Shambat: ns44 ... you are sick ... and I like it
18:56  infid: daemonkeeper: well it's not still at that ip for wahtever reason. i can't even ping it now
18:56  daemonkeeper: Yes, because you lie in another subnet.
18:57  infid: daemonkeeper: right so how do i ever get back in the router
18:57  infid: it's a catch22 if i have to change the ip range back to 192 yet i can't because i need to get into the router which is in 192, but i'm in 172
18:57  daemonkeeper: The easiest way is to configure an additional local IP on your host in the 192.168.1.0/24 range and go to the web interface
18:59  infid: how?
18:59  daemonkeeper: Are you on Linux?
18:59  infid: yeah
18:59  infid: ubuntu
18:59  daemonkeeper: What is your network interface, eth0?
18:59  infid: yeah
18:59  daemonkeeper: Then do "ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up" as root
19:00  infid: so i have to do that everytime i want to go into my router, then turn it back off so it doesnt conflict with my vpn? how do i turn that back off?
19:01  crilly: change 'up' to 'down'
19:01  daemonkeeper: You can reach the web interface afterwards. Just configure your router to an IP being in your new network, e.g. 172.x.x.1
19:01  infid: i see, thanks
19:02  daemonkeeper: (Make sure DHCP doesn't assign that IP though)
19:07  infid: i did that ifconfig command but i still can't even ping 192.168.1.254, does it take a few minutes to start working or something? i can see it in 'ifconfig' already
19:07  infid: inet addr:192.168.1.100  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0    UP BROADCAST ...
19:07  daemonkeeper: It should work by now
19:07  daemonkeeper: Show me your routing table
19:08  infid: it's in the routing table now but so is the VPN server's IP even though i disconnected from the vpn a while ago. in the order: VPN IP, 192.168.1.0, 172.16.0.0
19:09  infid: then after that 'link-local' then 'default'
19:09  daemonkeeper: Show it to me, there may be conflicts as you indicate already yourself. If so, you have to remove that route first.
19:10  infid: http://pastebin.ca/2011301
19:11  infid: if i were to reboot, and type 'route' again, that first 69.x.x.x ip of my VPN would go away, it only shows up once i connect/disconnect from the vpn
19:11  infid: not sure why
19:11  infid: i'm currently *disconnected* from the vpn
19:11  daemonkeeper: What is link-local for an IP?
19:11  infid: dunno
19:12  daemonkeeper: Do route -n
19:12  lupine_85: link-local is something in fc00::/7 IIRC
19:12  infid: 169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 eth0
19:12  lupine_85: it generally means an IP that only makes sense in the context of that particular segment
19:12  daemonkeeper: In IPv6, yes, lupine_85 ;)
19:12  lupine_85: i.e., not globally unique
19:13  lupine_85: you can probably set link-local IPv4 addresses too
19:13  lupine_85: isn't that what 169 is for?
19:13  lupine_85: yuss
19:13  daemonkeeper: 4to6 I think
19:13  lupine_85: upnp, all that
19:13  lupine_85: no, that's not 169
19:13  daemonkeeper: Anyway, not his problem
19:14  daemonkeeper: Your routing table looks feasible infid. Perhaps you changed something on the router besides of DHCP?
19:14  infid: nope
19:14  infid: well
19:15  infid: i did call at&t and they told me to try factory resetting the router
19:15  daemonkeeper: So it should listen on the default IP now
19:15  daemonkeeper: Which is vendor-dependend.
19:15  daemonkeeper: Consult your manual where you should be able to reach your router now
19:15  infid: because when i was tryin to save my dhcp change to the new 172 range it wouldnt let me save, kept saying my login password was wrong. so i called at&t and they told me to factory reset it by holding the reset button down on my router, so i did that and some how it did save my settings because after that i was in 172.16.1.0 range
19:16  daemonkeeper: To what does home resolve?
19:16  infid: i'lll have to google for the manual since i dont have a physical one for it and at&t tech support didnt seem to know jack
19:16  infid: daemonkeeper: home is
19:17  infid: 0.0.0.0         172.16.0.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
19:17  daemonkeeper: Oh, so your router should have 172.16.0.1 by now
19:17  daemonkeeper: At least it told your client that
19:18  infid: aha!, yep
19:18  infid: thanks
19:18  infid: kinda glad all this stuff went wrong, it forced me to get a networking 101 lesson :)
19:20  daemonkeeper: You should be fine by now. Your router changed subnet now and should not intercept with your VPN anymore
19:21  infid: sweet
19:21  infid: oh so last question is, why does my VPN's IP still show up in 'route' even though i'm disconnected?
19:21  infid: and how can i clean that up
19:21  daemonkeeper: Why do you think that? I don't see such a route
19:22  infid: the first line of route
19:22  infid: that's the same ip as the VPN i connect to
19:22  infid: in fact if i connect to the vpn right now it will show that line twice
19:23  daemonkeeper: That is not related to your VPN directly. If anything your VPN might set that route statically
19:23  daemonkeeper: Then your VPN does an unclean shutdown by not removing that route afterwards
19:26  infid: got disconnected did you say anything ?
19:26  daemonkeeper: Depends
19:26  infid: just connected to the vpn now route shows 192.168.1.1, then 69.198.100.228 then 69.198.100.228 again, then 192.168.1.0...
19:26  daemonkeeper: What was the last you got?
19:26  infid: nothing
19:26  daemonkeeper: [19:23] <daemonkeeper> That is not related to your VPN directly. If anything your VPN might set that route statically
19:26  daemonkeeper: [19:23] <daemonkeeper> Then your VPN does an unclean shutdown by not removing that route afterwards
19:27  daemonkeeper: "route del -host 69.x.x.x gw 172.16.0.1" should do its job if you want to remove that route on your own. It won't hurt though, as this is just a static route to override your VPN gateway
19:27  infid: thanks, how did you learn all this stuff btw?
19:28  daemonkeeper: Mostly on my own
19:28  infid: i taught myself linux and programming but never learned much networking. have any good sites/books?
19:29  daemonkeeper: Not really, I'm a really lazy person and Google things if I want to learn something. I have some network related books about JUNOS but that's it.
19:30  infid: honestly i think the main rason i never learned was because i was afraid to tinker with tutorials because of never having the time to let my network go down, since i always need it for work for php jobs
19:30  infid: oh well at least i think i know enough now to be able to tinker and bring my network back if i mess up
19:30 * Kyosh codes for motor oil
19:30  daemonkeeper: Networking is not that complicated, if you do really care.
19:31  daemonkeeper: At least fundamentals like your problem
19:31  infid: like anything it's inimidating until you get the fundamentals
19:31  daemonkeeper: *g* You're right
19:31  infid: but now it doesnt seem so scary. i really want to learn about ipv6 next
19:32  infid: i think another reason it was scary is most of the time i'd ask questions on irc, no one would answer me, but you did and one person yesterday did in #slackware and that was enough to help me get over the initial hump. so thanks :)
19:32  daemonkeeper: You just have to be patient in IRC.
19:33  daemonkeeper: Mailing lists/bulletin boards are better ideas if you really need an answer. IRC is more like "by the way, does anyone know ..."
19:33  Kyosh: irc is a cruel, harsh place, but many times you get what you need
19:33  Shambat: infid: you should look at "Computer Networks" by Andrew Tanenbaum ... I think its available through google books for free
19:33  infid: i find irc better than bulletain boards for some reason. everytime i google and see a forumn somewhere there's a question that's either not answered or is answered with 'idk? try [insert something that didnt work here]'
19:34  infid: Shambat: cool i will
19:34  daemonkeeper: Yup, Tanenbaum is good.
19:34  infid: is he royal
19:34  daemonkeeper: No, the evil himself to Linux people
19:34  infid: how come
19:34  daemonkeeper: Nonetheless a respectable person.
19:35  infid: i need to find that book in epub so i can read it on my ipad
19:35  daemonkeeper: http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html
19:38  daemonkeeper: However, he is best known for his books on computer networks and operating systems.
19:38  TRay: Hey guys, I'm trying to set up a socks proxy through a linux server for a Windows 7 client running OpenSSH. I can SSH into the linux box successfully but when I run "ssh -D 8080 user@server" and log in successfully and change the settings in Internet Explorer to use a socks proxy on "localhost:8080" and try to browse pages, I get this error: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.1p1 Debian-3ubuntu1 Protocol mismatch.
19:38  daemonkeeper: For TCP/IP the reference book is tcp/ip illustrated by Stevens.
19:39  TRay: I've got wireshark set up and it doesn't look like the Windows 7 box isn't sending anything out to the linux box.
19:39  TRay: Any help or direction would be much appreciated.
20:11  infid: in /etc/hosts should i map only localhost to 127.0.0.1 or can i map my desktop's hostname to it too? and can i map my desktop hostname to both 127.0.0.1 and it's LAN ip of 172.x.x.x at the same time?
20:14  mAniAk-_-: yeah
20:14  mAniAk-_-: go for it
20:14  mAniAk-_-: whats the worst taht could happen
20:19  tomeo: xand: I found the problem!
20:20  tomeo: xand: I didnt think it could be my router as the other computers where working fine.. but apparently using bittorrent on this computer had made the routing tables so large that eventually they stopped working properly. I just did a reset of the router and now it works fine :D
20:23  mAniAk-_-: wat
20:34  ArtyG: tomeo: Routers without much RAM will choke on torrents.
20:36  tomeo: ArtyG: okay :( and Im guessing those with lots of RAM are expensive?
20:36  ArtyG: Nah. Is it like...an 802.11g router?

21:03  peter123: hi! how can 1 router on route (result from tracert) has always >400ms latency and all further servers have <50ms?
21:04  peter123: i thought latency should +- grow
21:04  daemonkeeper: distance, priority, load?
21:05  mrpog: oh
21:05  xingu: peter123: control plane != data plane
21:05  CartoonCat: peter123: not all routers have a strong control plane. this means traffic target to the router it self could be veery very low piority, or unable to process it, etc
21:05  daemonkeeper: If you are referring to a router in the middle of the rtrace, routers (in enterprise) have very specialized routing engine processors, that is they can route packets very fast, but do everything else (e.g. reply to ICMP) with low priority
21:06  CartoonCat: love the deltas on that
21:12  SamuraiAlba: Hello.  I have an issue printing from 2 Vista Home laptops on a wireless network to a Windows 7 Ultimate machine.  The Vista laptops SEE the rpinter, and install drivers, but whenever I go to print a test page, it says "failed to print"  Any ideas?
21:13  daemonkeeper: That may be a driver issue. You should ask in ##windows (or was it #windows?) since this is not really a network problem, if you can reach the printer
21:13  SamuraiAlba: I asked.  I get crickets.
21:13  SamuraiAlba: I have the x86 and x64 drivers installed on the host
21:15  peter123: daemonkeeper this is the latency on the output from tracert, i have low pings and am happy, but i just don't understand it. i also tryed tracetcp (this uses tcp instead of icmp) and the result is the same
21:16  daemonkeeper: peter123: Post your traceroute and show us, what you find suspicous
21:16 +Kevin`: two people explained this in what I consider clear terms :/
21:16  xingu: hee hee

21:19  peter123: http://pastebin.com/WKvWQ85Z
21:19  xingu: a 2.5s wakeup delay is fairly impressive though, even by csco's standards; for instance that's a whole lot of packet memory at gigabit line rates...
21:19  daemonkeeper: This is exactly what CartoonCat and I said.
21:19  daemonkeeper: The router might have low priority to reply ICMP

21:30  peter123: ok, one learns entire life :). but tracert is not very reliable then..
21:31 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 168 seconds
21:31  daemonkeeper: No. Indeed traceroute is a totally different thing. There is no "official" to find out, how a packet finds its way to the destination, so traceroute guesses by sending packets with increasing TTLs
21:32  peter123: yes i know, but i tought the latency estimation is reliable (+/-)
21:33  peter123: and should add up
21:34  daemonkeeper: In theory you are right, in practice you noticed that routers are highly specialized devices which can do one thing very well, and everything else is bonus.
21:36  peter123: thnx all for explaining, bye :)
21:40  xingu: in fact it's entirely possible that the hop concerned is not forwarding its reply via the same path as you take to reach it. :)

21:55  CartoonCat: SamuraiAlba: for what OS?
22:03  SamuraiAlba: WIn 7 x64
22:03  daemonkeeper: Uh, that Linux distribution is unknown to me
22:04  daemonkeeper: The usual way for that distribution is go to $vendor_homepage, enter $devicename, click download driver
22:04  SamuraiAlba: :P
22:04  daemonkeeper: It has no apt yet.
22:04  daemonkeeper: So this is very painful.
22:04  TRay: daemonkeeper: Some people say that's the thing that Ubuntu is based off of.
22:04  tonyyarusso: Alternatively, call and talk to some guy in India.
22:06  xingu: TRay: what, the atheros 9285?
22:06  TRay: Windows 7.

22:33  daemonkeeper: I cannot believe, O'Reilly didn't publish any new books on IPv6 since 2005/06
22:33  jawnah: has it changed?
22:33  jawnah: or is it still that conceptual idea that is magical and most network admins refuse to implement on a large-scale?
22:34  daemonkeeper: The later, though we _must_ consider it soon, whether we want or not.
22:34  jawnah: yeah... I just got an email at work from our head network administrator with an IPv6 refresher course asking those of us involved in network ops to read-up
22:34  jawnah: I think he's planning on pushing something out soon
22:35  daemonkeeper: And yes, it has changed since then. Or at least further developed in some parts.
22:35  daemonkeeper: Fundamentals are the same since a decade.
22:35  jawnah: well the question is... if its changed, how "standardized" are the changes?
22:36  jawnah: Microsoft has had IPv6 for Windows XP out for quite a while
22:36  daemonkeeper: As if Microsoft would give anything on standards while they see alternatives.
22:36  infid: in /etc/hosts should i point my desktop's hostname at it's 192.x.x.x ip or localhost, or does it not matter. reason i'm using a hostname rather than localhost is for a databascript config file?
22:36  infid: s/databascript/database
22:36  jawnah: and to add to that... I was shocked to discuss the latest Cisco CCNA curriculum with one my employees who is in the program and he told me that IPv6 really isn't discussed much
22:37  jawnah: I was like "WHA??"
22:37  jawnah: It was not discussed much at all when I took it back in 2004.
22:38  jawnah: infid, normally the hostname resolves to the network adapter's IP
22:38  daemonkeeper: Yup, this is no surprise. IPv6 is widely ignored on both, enterprises and universities (despite the research area and clean slate  yackety-yak)
22:38  jawnah: and localhost would always be your localhost.
22:39  daemonkeeper: A friend of mine did his second CCIE also recently, were the entire material is in IPv4 except one part, like "by the way, you configure IPv6 like that"
22:41  jawnah: I used to be on a path to get CCNA -> CCNP -> CCIE
22:41  jawnah: but I decided not to
22:41  jawnah: ;/
22:41  daemonkeeper: I think I will target the Juniper track, if I get a chance to
22:47  daemonkeeper: Anyhow, since O'Reilly seems to leave me alone here: Does someone know a good book about IPv6 for IPv4 experts? I.e. A book for people that do know how to deploy networks and use IPv4 and its associated protocols (ARP, DHCP), but just want to know ho to deal with such issues in IPv6?
22:47  ronghail: no dhcp
22:47  daemonkeeper: I know
22:47  ronghail: no arp
22:47  daemonkeeper: I know
22:47  psychoschlumpf: radvd
22:47  daemonkeeper: That's why I mentioned it ;)
22:48  daemonkeeper: I know this things change, and I used IPv6 a bit already. But its time to recover ... unfortunately
22:48  ronghail: I had to learn ipv6 just last week.  never touched it before that.  and found that nmap has a lot of trouble scanning it.  I wonder why
22:49  daemonkeeper: Because something like 60% of all applications are not really IPv6 ready (or well tested)
22:49  daemonkeeper: Perhaps even more
22:49  psychoschlumpf: is there a good book covering ipv4->ipv6 migration?
22:49  daemonkeeper: Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for too
22:49  ronghail: who is going to route all the way into their corporate network from the internet?
22:49  ronghail: (nobody)
22:50  ronghail: so why the need for ipv6?
22:50  psychoschlumpf: ronghail: because v4 is exhausted
22:50  daemonkeeper: http://www.amazon.com/IPv6-Network-Administration-David-Malone/dp/0596009348/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1291585802&sr=8-7 That book sounds good, but as said, its quite old
22:50  ronghail: do big companies still own massive chunks of the address space or have those been reappropriated?
22:50  daemonkeeper: They are almost exhausted
22:51  ronghail: like when I was at bofa in the 90s they had like 4 class Bs
22:51  daemonkeeper: Chinese ISPs have big troubles already.
22:51  daemonkeeper: Of course US companies haven't such problems with their /8 networks from the 80s *g*
22:51  psychoschlumpf: ronghail: even with reclaiming old blocks, ipv4 will be exhausted by the end of 2011 given the current rate
22:52  daemonkeeper: The latest estimate was even earlier
22:52  psychoschlumpf: daemonkeeper: they don't include regained blocks
22:52  psychoschlumpf: err reclaimed blocks
22:53  psychoschlumpf: http://inetcore.com/project/ipv4ec/index_en.html
22:53  daemonkeeper: Well, or the 95% empty /8 networks assigned to some companies two decades ago
22:53  ronghail: the current disa stig (government computer and network auditing) says ipv6 is an audit finding  :)
22:54  ronghail: ie you fail the audit if you are using it
22:54  daemonkeeper: I got a new /23 last week. Just to make sure not to run out of IPv4 too soon ;)
22:55  psychoschlumpf: we got a /17 about 2months ao
22:55  daemonkeeper: Well, you may be a bit bigger then.
22:55  xous: *cries*
22:55  xous: we got a /21 recently
22:55  lupine_85: nom
22:55  lupine_85: I think we're going for another /19 soon
22:55  lupine_85: certainly, before RIPE run out
22:56  daemonkeeper: I think everyone will do this now.
22:56  psychoschlumpf: still we plan to have dual stack up until june next year
22:56  daemonkeeper: So do we
22:56  psychoschlumpf: which is good as this will increase the exhaustion rate
22:57  daemonkeeper: Though our carrier is not IPv6 ready yet. I've been asking for it since August. Idiots.
22:57  xous: o.O
22:57  xous: I've been annoying my ISP for native IPv6 for years
22:59  xous: Last time I was told "no, we only support PPPoE"
22:59  xous: -_-"
22:59  daemonkeeper: I don't know about plans of my ISP. But my carrier providing our dc uplink _really_ should take care soon.
23:00  daemonkeeper: I mean, come on, it's not such a big deal to announce an additional IPv6 route on BGP
23:00  xous: most of our hardware and offerings can't support it anyway.
23:01  xous: I can't wait to lol at cPanel 'solution' to the problem.
23:01  ScottG: So I have this TCP packet in wireshark whos info is "[TCP segment of a reassembled PDU]"
23:02  ScottG: What does that mean exactly?
23:02  xous: sounds like it's part of a fragmented packet to me.
23:02  psychoschlumpf: daemonkeeper: we have the problem that one of our carriers doesnt have an ipv6 ready infrastructure, so we could announce a ipv6 subnet, but their routers won't support it
23:02  lupine_85: get a better carrier? :p
23:03  ScottG: xous: What does that mean?
23:03  daemonkeeper: psychoschlumpf: That's exactly the problem we have. Although I think their hardware is capable to do that, they are just too lazy until now.
23:03  xous: ScottG: networks have a MTU value (usually 1500 bytes with Ethernet)
23:03  daemonkeeper: As far as I know the route with decent MX routers and EX switches
23:04  xous: if a packet hits a network with MTU lower than the packet size
23:04  xous: it's fragmented into smaller packets
23:04  psychoschlumpf: xous: that's what mtu discovery is meant for iirc
23:04  psychoschlumpf: but yes, it will be fragmented
23:04  xous: isn't that pretty broken because a lot of people disable in on public routers?
23:05  ScottG: xous: Ok, this is what I thought. Trying to wrap my head around it, though. So technically could the data you are sending be TCP header information for another packet? (If that doesn't make sense I will try to reword it)
23:05  xous: I can't make heads or tails of that.
23:07  xous: Argh. I think I'm watching a company fall a part from the inside out.
23:07  ScottG: xous: Well from what it seems to me this packet was fragmented into two pieces, one for the packets header information and one into the HTTP data
23:07  ScottG: Because another HTTP packet references then mentioned packet above
23:08  xous: No. each packet must have IP/TCP header
23:08  xous: http payload will be split between the two in the TCP data field
23:08  ScottG: Yea, but it doesn't look to me like the data was split up at all
23:09  ScottG: Unless wireshark just abstracts that away
23:09  xous: It might reassemble the complete packet
23:09  xous: not sure.
23:09  ScottG: I think that is what it is doing
23:09  ScottG: xous: On what OSI layer is the fragmenting handed?
23:09  ScottG: handled*
23:10  xous: TCP I think
23:10  xous: but hell. I'm rusty.
23:10  rvsjoen: you can get fragmentation on any layer that changes the max payload
23:10  daemonkeeper: psychoschlumpf: #ipv6 recommended me http://www.ipv6forum.com/dl/books/the_second_internet.pdf That looks reasonable good.
23:11  ScottG: Because what I see is an HTTP packet with all the HTML data in it but it references this other frame and that frame says it is a segment of a reassembled PDU.
23:12  ScottG: I would think it would show me two HTTP packets with half the HTML in each
23:12  psychoschlumpf: daemonkeeper: thanks
23:12  ScottG: I don't get why it isn't doing that besides for simplicity I suppose
23:12  rvsjoen: you can probably configure it not to do application level reassembly
23:12  rvsjoen: wireshark I mean
23:12  ScottG: Right
23:13  ScottG: ugh, that was confusing the hell out of me
23:14  ScottG: rvsjoen: I still don't get why it called that other packet TCP instead of HTTP, though
23:16  ScottG: AHA! That was it!
23:17  ScottG: I went into the settings and unchecked "Reassemble HTTP bodies spanning multiple TCP segments" and that TCP packet changed to a HTTP packet
23:21  ScottG: Although when I do that it seems that i can't look at the raw HTML data anymore, odd
23:21  ScottG: I really want to see that physical separation of the HTML into multiple packets
23:24  ScottG: Hm, i actually don't think it did do that. It split it up so that the HTTP header info was in one fragment and the HTML was in another
23:24  ScottG: Dam
