15:44  marshallmc1: can anyone suggest a cheaper solution than a sonet ring?
16:01 --- ChanServ sets modes [##networking +v Mxyzpltk]
16:14  hali: marshallmc1: depends what is available in your area
16:14  hali: and over what distance, what bandwidth is required etc
16:15  hali: metro ethernet is cheap as chips these days in most city areas

16:26  ss0: I have a summit 450a switch with multiple vlans configured on it and a juniper ssg-550 router /firewall this is my first time configuring a network with vlans and I would appeciate any advice in regards to static routes between the vlans on the switch, good idea or bad idea etc.
16:26  ss0: Could I publish those static routes via ospf?

17:01  Assid: heya
17:02  Assid: this isnt really networking specific.. but i have a trendnet ip110, and i want to record it.. the software provided sucks.. and records in raw avi i think
17:02  Assid: it eats up 20mb for 20 seconds of video
17:02 --- doub is now known as JeromeV
17:53  toad_: I am considering options for protecting a peer to peer network ... we've looked at captchas and hashcash and they look like they are probably way too cheap. we are thinking of leveraging the scarcity value of IP addresses. roughly speaking what does an IP address cost?
17:54  toad_: I know personal VPNs you can get for something like $10 ... but there are a limited (if large) number of providers; if we can limit at the level of IP ranges not just addresses, we can avoid corporates just using all their IPs ... if that is true, how much does it cost, in bulk, to get a random IP address somewhere in the world?
17:56  dbruns: We are having a very odd problem with our servers in our office. No one can access any of our multiple web servers, but our Pix firewall is showing incoming packets.. none of the webservers are showing incoming traffic.  We are able to access internet outgoing from inside though..  We are completely stumped...  suggestions?
18:04  CartoonCat: toad_: what are you trying to do exactly?
18:04  CartoonCat: dbruns: can you get to web servers from the LAN ?
18:05  toad_: CartoonCat: basically, to beat our network, the bad guys only have to connect to everyone, and they only need a few KB/sec for each node they connect to
18:05  toad_: CartoonCat: I'm trying to construct some sort of scheme that makes it expensive for them to connect to everyone
18:06  toad_: CartoonCat: we've considered captchas and hashcash but they are pretty poor for several obvious reasons
18:06  CartoonCat: toad_: that doesnt explain what this network is, or how its connected, etc
18:06  toad_: CartoonCat: but IP addresses are genuinely scarce ... I just need to know the economic value of that scarcity ...
18:07  CartoonCat: toad_: move to v6, I would not even bother with v4 if it has any costs
18:07  toad_: CartoonCat: it's a peer to peer network, it has users joining and leaving and relies on a certain amount of connection churn; at the moment it has about 8000 nodes online at once
18:07  toad_: CartoonCat: my objective is to create cost not to avoid it!
18:08  CartoonCat: toad_: ok now you really lost me
18:08  toad_: CartoonCat: if to break an 80,000 node network the attacker would need 2,000 IP addresses, and those addresses would cost $10 a piece, then we can be fairly confident only attackers with reasonable funding will try
18:08  toad_: CartoonCat: make sense?
18:08  dbruns: CartoonCat: yes we can.. no one internally notices a problem.. its just when people try to connect to any one of our servers from the outside..  exchange, multiple linux web servers, and a few other windows servers are all not working
18:08  CartoonCat: no becasue a attacker cna get zombie ips for free
18:08  toad_: how? botnets? any legal means?
18:09  CartoonCat: botnets are dirt cheap to setup
18:09  dbruns: CartoonCat: the firewall packet capture shows packets coming in to the web servers but I'm not seeing anything come in to the actual servers
18:09  toad_: having to go to a botnet has a cost - botnets are bought and sold, and the risk of getting caught again has a cost
18:09  blockcold: what is portforwarding ?
18:09  CartoonCat: dbruns: sounds like a firewall rule issue then
18:09  hali: ip addresses has a price tag these days?
18:09  toad_: quite a serious cost for some of our likely adversaries
18:09  ish10: hey guys i have 22 clusters, and i dont have a NAS, i wanted to share 1 machines hard disk on all the machines to get a shared drive. Is that possible? and how?
18:10  toad_: hali: that's exactly what i'm asking
18:10  ish10: static ip's go for about 15 bucks i think
18:10  toad_: well, dynamic is fine, as long as they are _unique_
18:10  CartoonCat: depends on the isp and the need. i get /24's free from some, pay 200 from others
18:11  hali: they dont and they do, if you ask for IP space from RIPE/ARIN etc they and the RIR charge you an admin fee, very small, less than $1000 usually, same for a /24 and a /8, all you need to do is *justify* why you need it
18:11  toad_: well, we can limit larger ranges, although there may be some costs for us to doing that
18:11  ish10: blockcold, forwarding traffic from one port to another
18:11  hali: but that ISP/colo providers then charge you for IP space is bollocks
18:11  toad_: if you need 1000 IP addresses all on different /16's then how much is *that* going to cost?
18:11  CartoonCat: hali: not at all, it keeps drivel from using space when they dont need it
18:12  toad_: the naive answer is around $10K cos you'd just buy VPNs, right?
18:12  hali: CartoonCat: on that point, true yes
18:12  CartoonCat: toad_: you can go buy that
18:12  ish10: $10k sounds right
18:12  hali: it sounds like a very bizzare case
18:12  CartoonCat: hali: the cost should be lower, but there should be a cost
18:12  toad_: is it possible for corporates, law enforcement etc to obtain them much more cheaply?
18:12  hali: CartoonCat: i agree, i think ARIN/RIPE etc are upping their fee's as well
18:12  CartoonCat: toad_: jsut what eactly is this network? its it P2P you mean?
18:12  toad_: whereas if they are all on the same /16 you can probably get them virtually free if you're a large organisation?
18:13  toad_: CartoonCat: yes I said it's a p2p network
18:13  CartoonCat: hali: doesnt ARIN have a $100 /48 for resi use?
18:13  CartoonCat: toad_: peer to peer is not the same as P2P heheh
18:13  toad_: CartoonCat: a peer to peer network
18:14  blockcold: ish10: thanks when ever any body got my ip he log on to my router page and change my setting :(
18:14  toad_: we would like to take advantage of the scarcity in IP addresses to make it expensive for an attacker to connect to every node - much more expensive than the bandwidth would be
18:14  CartoonCat: "peer to peer" can mean 20 ad-hoc wireless clients, P2P pretty much means torrents or such
18:14  tuxx: hey guys
18:14  toad_: okay, a relatively large peer to peer network then :)
18:14  blockcold: hi tuxx
18:14  tuxx: i was wondering.. is it possible to set up a private tor network?
18:14  CartoonCat: tuxx: sure, dont see why not
18:15  CartoonCat: toad_: you are going about this the wrong way
18:15  tuxx: CartoonCat: tor has 1 main server which provides the clients
18:15  toad_: CartoonCat: oh?
18:15  tuxx: with a list of nodes .. and the client then decides which random path to chose
18:15  tuxx: right?
18:15  toad_: CartoonCat: I should make it secure even if the attacker connects to everyone? I know, the problem is our architecture doesn't allow for that without a massive performance penalty :|
18:15  rawplayer: you can configure an entry node
18:15  CartoonCat: tuxx: something like that. iirc they have super nodes not a central server, but its been some time
18:16  ish10: blackcold, you may just have dhcp
18:16  toad_: (at least not in p2p mode; in f2f mode it should work fine, but nobody uses f2f mode)
18:16  blockcold: hi toad_
18:16  CartoonCat: toad_: it depends on MANY things. jsut saying its a peer to peer network means jack crap. what KIND of peer to peer, torrents?
18:17  toad_: CartoonCat: I'm not following
18:17  CartoonCat: toad_: obviously
18:17  toad_: :|
18:17  CartoonCat: toad_: ive ask for better idea of WHAT this network is. just saying
18:17  toad_: it is a specific peer to peer network, its security in p2p mode is vastly lower than what a lot of people assume, and we're trying to improve it ...
18:17  CartoonCat: 'peer to peer' doesnt mean anything other then peer, to peers
18:18  toad_: CartoonCat: http://freenetproject.org/
18:18  blockcold: what is port trigring and waht is the difference between port forwwarding and port triggering ?
18:18  hali: ah one of them :)
18:18  CartoonCat: blockcold: triggering menas something inside the network asked for it to open the port dynamicly. port forwarding is assumed to be a static rule
18:19  CartoonCat: toad_: there we go, real information
18:19  CartoonCat: toad_: ips costing money or not, will have nothing to do with how or if people attack and what can be done about it
18:20 --- dbruns_ is now known as dbruns
18:20  toad_: CartoonCat: oh? I always heard in security you need to make it cost the attacker more than he's willing to pay
18:20  CartoonCat: toad_: the root problemo is the network design, period. you need faster conenctions.
18:20  CartoonCat: toad_: yea, 20 years ago
18:21  CartoonCat: toad_: and yes, for physical security that holds true. it does not hold true on the internet
18:21  toad_: CartoonCat: ahhh, you mean if we require everyone to have 20Mbps upstream and then have 1Mbps per peer, we can make it prohibitively expensive on bandwidth ? :)
18:21  toad_: CartoonCat: why not?
18:21  toad_: CartoonCat: because *everything* is dirt cheap on the internet? :|
18:21  CartoonCat: toad_: yea i mean make people have more band width. no not make it prohibitively expensive on bandwidth
18:21  CartoonCat: toad_: look at the recent wikileaks attack. it was over 10Gbps
18:21  toad_: CartoonCat: an awful lot of people are on 8M/448k DSL still, or much worse :|
18:22  toad_: CartoonCat: we can't realistically require even a 1Mbps upstream
18:22  CartoonCat: yes exactly, you have NO bandwidth for doing the serving stuffs
18:22  CartoonCat: toad_: THAT is what is wrong with your model, no bandwidth. nothing you do will change that.
18:23  CartoonCat: toad_: im wrong, something you do CAN change that, buy real pipes.
18:23  toad_: CartoonCat: that is a fundamental problem with *any* fully distributed peer to peer network, no?
18:23  CartoonCat: toad_: yes and no. you are trying to push up dynamic content that is small, most p2p is not
18:24  toad_: hmmm, am I?
18:24  toad_: we are serving static content exclusively, and some of it is big
18:24  CartoonCat: toad_: if what the website says is true, Yes.
18:24  toad_: chat etc are essentially built on top of static caching
18:25  toad_: browsing is static but small(ish)
18:25  CartoonCat: toad_: chat should jsut be IRC or Jabber heh
18:25  CartoonCat: toad_: oh so you guys are not really pushing websites over this freenet then?
18:25  toad_: well, the two operations at the network level are publish and fetch
18:25  toad_: CartoonCat: we are publishing freesites, which are static content
18:26  CartoonCat: which is <small>
18:26  toad_: everything gets chopped into 32KB chunks etc
18:26  CartoonCat: wow talk about kick your own arse
18:26  CartoonCat: at least make things ~ MTU
18:26  toad_: well, most sites have multiple files which add up to considerably more than 32K
18:26  CartoonCat: its stupid to push 10 32KB packets instead of 1 320KB packet
18:27  CartoonCat: 32KB is still small
18:27  toad_: we used to have variable sized chunks but it was a major PITA...
18:27  CartoonCat: ahh
18:27  CartoonCat: well MTU x 100 would be better
18:27  toad_: CartoonCat: right, but it works well given an awful lot of nodes have like 20KB/sec upstream
18:28  CartoonCat: wow
18:28  toad_: unfortunately we can't actually use much more than ~ 140KB/sec with the current situation
18:28  CartoonCat: yea, content is to small
18:28  toad_: that's what I mean by fully distributed peer to peer - most nodes have domestic connections, a lot of those are poor DSL1
18:28  _Valantis_: Hello
18:29  CartoonCat: goodbye
18:29  toad_: some of the content is big, you can fetch an ISO in a couple of days
18:29  toad_: if it's popular or recently inserted
18:29  CartoonCat: lol
18:30  CartoonCat: i can get isos in < hour from real places
18:30  toad_: that is actually adequate for a lot of uses
18:30  toad_: sure
18:30  toad_: if those places aren't blocked
18:30  toad_: if you don't mind logs etc
18:30  CartoonCat: if you think your setup doesnt leave traces, you dont know what you are doing.
18:30  toad_: anti-censorship, anonymity
18:31  toad_: ah so you're saying anonymous censorship resistant peer to peer is impossible in principle? i guess i should go away then :|
18:32  CartoonCat: toad_: unless you are encrypting EVERY packet, then yes you are not being anonymous
18:32  toad_: CartoonCat: who says we're not encrypting every packet?
18:33  toad_: our basic problem is the secure way is friend-to-friend, but since nobody actually knows anyone using freenet, most people use peer-to-peer; and in peer-to-peer mode, it's pretty easy for the bad guys to get connected to everyone and intercept traffic
18:33  toad_: friend-to-friend mode is very difficult to block and should work even in e.g. china (who have largely successfully blocked tor for instance)
18:33  CartoonCat: and as I said. take a lession from torrents. they can do per connection encryption between peers
18:33 +Kevin`: toad_: it's fine if the bad guys intercept encrypted traffic. they can do that anyway
18:34  toad_: Kevin`: we're not an onion routing network. it's surprisingly hard to get that right despite it being good in theory, as has been seen
18:34  CartoonCat: toad_: hard to get what right?
18:34  toad_: Kevin`: the connections are encrypted and so are the data chunks, but *the bad guys can identify the chunks anyway if they know what keys make up a specific file*
18:35 +Kevin`: toad_: actually I haven't seen any attacks on that besides timing by large entities, perhaps you could enlighten me
18:35 +Kevin`: why would the bad guys know your encryption keys?
18:35  toad_: Kevin`: there are loads of attacks on tor at route selection or traffic analysis level, anyway it's not what we do and if we did we probably wouldn't build freenet on top of it
18:35  toad_: Kevin`: it's a data storage network, not a tunneling network
18:36  CartoonCat: Kevin`: because they use 1 key per file and hand that key to everyone heheh
18:36 +Kevin`: oh, right, isn't freenet encyption more for not knowing what's on your own system?
18:36 --- |Assid| is now known as Assid
18:36  CartoonCat: my take on it is that its more like a hash then a key, but ive not spent any real time digging
18:36  Assid: hey
18:36  Assid: this isnt really networking specific.. but i have a trendnet ip110, and i want to record it.. the software provided sucks.. and records in raw avi i think
18:36  toad_: on darknet (f2f), this is relatively safe, but on opennet (p2p), it is so easy to get connections that both anonymity and censorship resistance are rather doubtful
18:37  Assid: any suggestions on how i can go about this
18:37  CartoonCat: Assid: use VLS to transcode the stream
18:37  toad_: CartoonCat: yeah the routing key is based on the content hash, the decryption keys are kept separately
18:37  toad_: i.e. in the URI, not in the block being passed around
18:37  Assid: CartoonCat: too many cameras.. and i need proper reording solution
18:38  CartoonCat: Assid: huh odd, i use VLS for 'proper recording solutions' in 2u's all the time, but what ever
18:39  Assid: whats vls?
18:39  CartoonCat: toad_: the problems your having can not be worked around really. you have to let people in to get content, and when you do, they can be bad people. unless you plan to vet every person in person, its not going ot be secure on a seat level, anything higher is jsut dreaming
18:39  Assid: wait.. i thought you meant vlc
18:39  CartoonCat: Assid: VLS is the server side to VLC
18:40  Assid: and it will auto "arvhice" dates?
18:40  CartoonCat: Assid: you have ot use SOMETHING to transcode the stream down to something you find acceptable since raw isnt
18:40  toad_: CartoonCat: in other words only f2f can be anything approaching safe, yeah, we've assumed that for years, I just had hoped there might be some way to use IP scarcity (initially captcha scarcity) ...
18:41  CartoonCat: Assid: thats depends on your setup, you can do a lot with a little scripting. i once setup VLS to pull in on the ethernet from cams nad push out on coax that we fed into a HIPPA compliant recorder because some admin didnt accept the setup
18:41  Assid: my source is an ip camera, providing mjpeg
18:42  CartoonCat: toad_: IPs are not lacking. IPv4 IPs are. IPv6 IPs, well do some reading
18:42  CartoonCat: Assid: ok, so you have 2 options, A) transcode it B) make the camera output at what you want
18:43  toad_: CartoonCat: yeah I know but IPv6 being widely deployed will probably take as long as freenet 1.0 :)
18:43  CartoonCat: toad_: i would not assume that at all
18:43  Assid: CartoonCat: camera doesnt support the output i want :(
18:43  CartoonCat: toad_: in less then a year we will see the fist true denials for new v4 ip space
18:44 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: i'm actually taking the cynical route on that too. I suspect triple-natted ipv4-only will be common before the average person starts getting ip addresses again
18:44  CartoonCat: Assid: then you can only transcode. use anything you want ot do it. my pref is VLS
18:44  CartoonCat: Kevin`: thank god I planed MY v4 NAT at the core and not the user edge =)
18:45 +Kevin`: ?
18:45  CartoonCat: and have a full v6 routing to 90% of my network
18:45  CartoonCat: <--- wISP
18:45 +Kevin`: well the latter part is good :)
18:45 +Kevin`: do you give your users ipv4 at all besides nat, or did you already run out on that
18:45  jrm`: CartoonCat, toad_ : http://blog.icann.org/2010/10/and-then-there-were-12/
18:46  CartoonCat: i use 10./24's at all clients and do NAT at the core router. if people <really> need ips i pptp them, makes it much easier to later go 'oh crap, no new ips, people need ot share for a bit'
18:46  CartoonCat: jrm`: yup its coming up fast
18:47  jrm`: yea
18:47  jrm`: and see the huge waste : http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xml
18:47  jrm`: see some comanies are (not) using their /8's ..
18:47  jrm`: that makes me sick :)
18:48 +Kevin`: jrm`: i'm quite sure those companies will start selling off their addresses at exhorbinant rates to people who need ip addresses
18:48  jrm`: you're probably right
18:48 +Kevin`: having a server on the internet is going to be impossible for a span of time
18:48 +Kevin`: :(
18:48  CartoonCat: jrm`: yup i agree. and i was happy when that media corp gave back most of their /8
18:49  Assid: CartoonCat: any idea what source i should use for a trendnet tv-ip110 ?
18:50  CartoonCat: Kevin`: i do not think very long. if it breaks netflix or WoW or Steam ,i hear the peoples with the skill to make the telcos hurt getting very upset very fast
18:50  CartoonCat: Assid: not a clue, tell me the options it has
18:50 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: people already accept it for cellular connections on most isps
18:50  jrm`: "UK ministry of defence" -> 25.0.0.0/8 --> Wtf ??!
18:51  CartoonCat: Kevin`: yea and i still sell connectiosn to people with those cause they can not get their games and movies to work. they only accept it when they dont know if effects them
18:51  Assid: loads the ultramjcam activex
18:51  CartoonCat: jrm`: look at the 6? 8? /8's going to the us DOD
18:52  CartoonCat: and the /8's for halburton, xerox, et al
18:52  Assid: CartoonCat: it does mjpeg and motion detection
18:52  Assid: not much otherwise
18:52  jrm`: might be for their 16,000,000+ web servers :)
18:52  CartoonCat: heh
18:53  CartoonCat: nice mask
18:54  Kevin`_: that reminds me, ipv6 reverse dns is fun :D
18:55  CartoonCat: Kevin`: yea but not with sixxs or he space
18:55  spicemaster: how can i use voip in my hose ?
18:55  spicemaster: *house
18:55 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: he says they delegate normally, but I haven't tried it on there yet.. problems?
18:55  spicemaster: which is best provide of voip ?
18:55 +Kevin`: spicemaster: you need an ip connection, do you have that?
18:55  Assid: CartoonCat: what else can i tell you about it
18:56 +Kevin`: spicemaster: are you comfortable setting up your own system or do you want managed service?
18:56  spicemaster: ip connection waht kind of ip connection ?
18:56 +Kevin`: spicemaster: to the internet, normally
18:56 +Kevin`: spicemaster: you should have an ipv4 ip, too
18:56  spicemaster: no i ahve dynamic ip :(
18:56 +Kevin`: (dynamic is fine)
18:57  CartoonCat: they take your blocks away
18:57 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: ??
18:57  CartoonCat: bah that was fun!
18:57  CartoonCat: need to reboot at some point, damn wifi card goes bonkers after using it in monitor mod
18:57  CartoonCat: e
18:58  CartoonCat: Assid: no idea, like i said, 2 options
18:58 +Kevin`: they take your blocks away?
18:58  spicemaster: yes i want to configure at my own sustem sir
18:58  tuxx: is anyone familiar with tor?
18:58  tuxx: and how to set up super nodes?
18:58 +Kevin`: spicemaster: what country do you plan to make most of your calls to/from?
18:58  spicemaster: domestic and US
18:59  spicemaster: how can i setup a Voip ?
18:59 +Kevin`: what's domestic for you? (internet. I don't know where you are.)
18:59  spicemaster: India .
19:00 +Kevin`: spicemaster: I personally like asterisk. I don't know what an ideal provider for india would be, but I use flowroute for us.
19:00 +Kevin`: spicemaster: voip-info.org lists stuff like that
19:00  OmNomSequitur: It's Kojima-sama!
19:01  OmNomSequitur: Er, wrong channel.
19:01  CartoonCat: Kevin`: if you do ipv6 spam (hosts like :DEAD:BEEF::1)
19:01  CartoonCat: spicemaster: are you looking to have VOIP in your LAN, or to conenct your POTS to and Voip across the internet?
19:01  CartoonCat: %$#@
19:01  CartoonCat: test test
19:01  spicemaster: thanks Kevin`
19:01  OmNomSequitur: spicemaster: what's the easiest spice to master?
19:01  spicemaster: CartoonCat: vip in lan
19:02  spicemaster: CartoonCat: *voip in my lan
19:02 +Kevin`: spicemaster: do you want to use existing internal phone lines or network-connected phones
19:02  spicemaster: OmNomSequitur: i can't get you sir
19:02 +Kevin`: OmNomSequitur: ltspice seems popular
19:04  spicemaster: Kevin`: just want to use my lan for voip
19:04 +Kevin`: spicemaster: also, how many phone lines? (2? 20? 200?)
19:04  spicemaster: just one :)
19:04  CartoonCat: bah damn it. wlan1 keeps droping the ip
19:05 +Kevin`: spicemaster: so, back to the other question, what kind of phone do you want to use? (or a computer headset, whatever)
19:05  spicemaster: a basic phone
19:06  spicemaster: is ip phone is necessary ?
19:06  spicemaster: for voip ?
19:07  spicemaster: Kevin`: a basic phone which we have in our home
19:07 +Kevin`: you can do it from a computer. you can get adapter boxes for pots -- ip. you can stick channel cards into a computer and connect phone lines to them. you can get a network-attached phone device..
19:07 +Kevin`: the adapter boxes (called an ata) are rather nice for a small number of analog phone lines
19:08  CartoonCat: ok try this again
19:08 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: you need an irc shell
19:08  spicemaster: Kevin`: that gr8 many many thnaks for this help :)
19:09  CartoonCat: Kevin`: yea i used to run a bnc but that box died by fire and ive been lazy to replace it
19:09  spicemaster: CartoonCat: #shellium is there for you :)
19:09 +Kevin`: spicemaster: I use one of these, along with a computer running asterisk, but there are multiple ways to set it up: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10027/index.html
19:10  CartoonCat: spicemaster: i do not like boxes i do not own
19:10  spicemaster: CartoonCat: thats much better ;)
19:10  CartoonCat: Kevin`: have you tried out that google voice setup for asterisk?
19:10 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: nah it seemed kinda hacky. it's still on my list of things to try though, when I get around to it :/
19:11 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: how's it work?
19:11  CartoonCat: spicemaster: ill become unlazy shortly and palce a 1u box at the colo
19:11  CartoonCat: Kevin`: ive not used the much less hacky one as yet
19:11 +Kevin`: a whole box just for irc? I have a virtual machine dedicated to irc and I something think that's overkill ;p
19:11  CartoonCat: Kevin`: in fack, its a proper setup from what i have read. it doesnt do the dialbacks nad stuff now
19:12 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: ooh, have a link?
19:12 +Kevin`: sometimes*
19:12  CartoonCat: Kevin`: oh ill pop rtorrent on it and a few other such things too, in vm's as well
19:13  spicemaster: Kevin`: thanks again sir
19:15  Assid: CartoonCat: stupid camera is a pita
19:16  CartoonCat: Kevin`: nothing but press releases, its a feature of 1.8
19:16  CartoonCat: Assid: yup sounds like it. repalce it.
19:16  Assid: just bought it :(
19:16  Assid: wont get a replacement
19:17  CartoonCat: well, then you are down to 1 option it sounds like
19:17  Assid: i cant get vlc to stream it
19:18  Assid: http://<ip>/cgi/mjpg/mjpeg.cgi thats theoretically supposed to access the mjpeg
19:18 +Kevin`: btw, can has? http://nelson.kwzs.be/
19:18  Assid: which doesnt seem to do anything in vlc
19:20  CartoonCat: http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://nelson.kwzs.be
19:20  CartoonCat: Its not just you!
19:21  CartoonCat: Assid: might need some kind of browser responce, or need javascript or such. not looking good.
19:21 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: it doesn't work for you? that's suprising
19:21  CartoonCat: it doesnt work for me or for the online checker
19:22  CartoonCat: oooh interesting
19:22 +Kevin`: halcyon:~# curl http://nelson.kwzs.be
19:22 +Kevin`: <html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>
19:22 +Kevin`: :/
19:22  CartoonCat: i CAN get a ip for it, but opendns seams to think it is down also
19:23  elb0w: its not sewing properly then
19:23  CartoonCat: eggplant ~ # curl http://nelson.kwzs.be
19:23  CartoonCat: eggplant ~ #
19:23 +xand: opendns, breaking dns since.... ?
19:23  CartoonCat: xand: true, but i also tried googles 4x8 and got the same
19:23 +Kevin`: what ip do you get for it? I suppose it's possible something has a month-old cached value
19:24  CartoonCat: 67.215.65.132
19:24 +Kevin`: that's.. strange
19:24 +Kevin`: what nameserver is giving that?
19:24  CartoonCat: opendns
19:24 +xand: but yeah, I get "no answer" from the NSes for it
19:24  CartoonCat: googles 8.8.8.8 gives no domin
19:24 +xand: which are ns1.etmalec.net (and 2 and 4)
19:24 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: maybe it's opendns's error page? they like to do that sometimes
19:24  CartoonCat: Kevin`: ah could be
19:24 +Kevin`: xand: aaaa record only btw
19:25 +xand: o
19:25 +xand: nelson.kwzs.be has IPv6 address 2002:4334:2f41:182:216:3eff:feff:31
19:25  CartoonCat: oh that might expalins it
19:25 +xand: CartoonCat proves opendns' brokenness ;)
19:25 +xand: 67.215.65.132 is one of their failservers
19:25  CartoonCat: yes it is
19:25 +xand: why they should not be used
19:26  CartoonCat: xand: yea but <I> get less support calls by using them. people get nice error pages saying "User, You screwed up, I will try and help you"
19:26 +Kevin`: lol
19:26 +xand: except they didn't screw up
19:26 +xand: in this case
19:27 +xand: it did
19:27  CartoonCat: in this case no they did not
19:27  CartoonCat: yea
19:27  CartoonCat: i can live with that
19:27 +xand: it's horrid and should be banned.
19:28  Assid: trendnet :(
19:29  CartoonCat: xand: so is ipv6 =)
19:29 +xand: I agree that's horrid
19:29 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: come up with a better option and get it working on all current os's :/
19:29  gulum: if a router gets an arp request, will the hub/switch automatically broadcast the arp request to the computers connected to it?
19:29  CartoonCat: something between should have been done, or even totaly different
19:30 +xand: gulum: what hub/switch?
19:30 +Kevin`: gulum: a router with a built-in switch?
19:30  CartoonCat: anything unmanaged should forward the broadcast
19:30  gulum: +Kevin`, hmm. let's suppose this is the deal. i just don't know how it can be done differently (when router and switch/hub are different devices)
19:31 +Kevin`: the switch in the average router is managed but WILL forward the broadcast normally
19:31  CartoonCat: Kevin`: how do you figure a consumer routers switch is 'managed' ?
19:31 +Kevin`: at least to the same network segment
19:31 +Kevin`: CartoonCat: because a managed switch chip (almost all of them are these days) is cheaper than two ethernet interfaces
19:32 +Kevin`: funny, eh? :)
19:32  CartoonCat: Kevin`: ok yes they use a internal trucking but almost none of them let the user change it from looking like a unmanaged switch
19:33  CartoonCat: +n
19:33 +Kevin`: these days I never buy something if it can't run openwrt
19:33  gulum: hmm, will the hub/switch forward the packet?
19:33  CartoonCat: i dont buy it if it didnt come from routerboard.com =)
19:33 +Kevin`: hehe
19:33  CartoonCat: gulum: yes
19:34 +Kevin`: gulum: yes, it will. at least to the lan ports
19:34  gulum: and what happens in a case which i have a seperate router device and a switch/hub device?
19:34  gulum: the router will know how to do it? because it operates at layer 3 while he doesn't mess with MAC addresses
19:35 +Kevin`: gulum: the switch/hub will forward it to all of it's ports, including the one the router is attached to
19:35 +xand: it'll get sent to the router
19:35 +xand: iff it relates to the router's IP address, it will respond.~
19:36 +Kevin`: the router doesn't need to forward the arp packet to anything
19:51  CartoonCat: Kevin`: http://forums.digium.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=76250&start=0
19:53  TRay: Hey guys, I'm looking for a utility or strategy to disrupt all the traffic on a local network but without attacking the network infrastructure physically or their configs. Am I out of luck or can someone point me in the right direction? My goal is basically to bring down the local network without disrupting the supporting network we're connected to. My security class is doing a CTF thing for our final practical and rather than actually
19:55  xous: TRay: flood the thing with traffic
19:55 +Kevin`: have you tried simple things like arp-spoofing the gateway?
19:56 +xand: rogue dhcp server
19:56  CartoonCat: EMP
19:56 +Kevin`: connect two network ports together
19:56  iratik: Here is what I need to happen. I need a web server www.somedomain.com where requests that are made to www.somedomain.com/foo go are rewritten as www.foo.com and passed through squid proxy .. then the results passed back to the user
19:57 +Kevin`: TRay: your message got cut off after "rather than actually"
19:57  xous: isn't creating a loop a physical attack?
19:57  iratik: Like a ..server side proxy configured in the web server.. how can i do this ?
19:57  TRay: Oh here's the last part then: " My security class is doing a CTF thing for our final practical and rather than actually go after the objective, I'd rather just be a jerk and bring it down for everyone else."
19:57  CartoonCat: iratik: why do you need it
19:57  xous: iratik: nat + squid
19:57  TRay: I would arp spoof the gateway but we're all basically connected to the same switch, there's no routing that happens.
19:58  TRay: The instructor basically just doesn't want us busting his configs or physically touching the switches.
19:58  CartoonCat: TRay: then arpspoof all the ips on it heh
19:58  xous: TRay: one massive Vlan?
19:58  xous: TRay: do you have teh hardware specs?
19:58  TRay: xous: To my knowledge, yes.
19:58 +Kevin`: xous: I think the restriction of physical attacks is for physical damage. that attack is physical but would cause no damage
19:59  iratik: I want to create a website that does some text transformations to other websites and proxies the site.  http://www.pirateify.com/www.google.com
19:59  TRay: Essentially, if I can power off the virtual machine and everything goes back to normal on it's own, it's pretty much fair game.
20:00  iratik: I've got the text transformation proxy done .. but to get it to work the user has to configure their proxy server on the browser side.. then everything is flipped ..    I just need to move it into nginx or apache somehow to get it to work
20:00  iratik: I can't figure out what that's called .. "Double proxy"  .. "Server side reproxy" ?
20:00  iratik: so i can't figure out what to google to figure out what i would need to do
20:01 +xand: reverse proxy?
20:01 +Kevin`: TRay: you know what would be really fun, and may even be possible in a ctf environment with "old crap software" as is necessary, have two echo services talk to each other
20:01  xous: iratik: just nat the traffic to the proxy
20:01  iratik: nat the traffic ?
20:01  xous: iratik: what's your setup?
20:02  TRay: Kevin`: What would the goal be? Honeypot?
20:02  ovrflw0x: can anyone write a "dd-wrt" Bash script for me for this? it is in perl http://privatepaste.com/02b7ee6526
20:02  iratik: nginx , using a proxy written  in rack on ubuntu
20:02  ovrflw0x: what exactly will i have to do?
20:02 +Kevin`: TRay: no, just to generate an infinite amount of traffic. a flood by itself won't bring down ethernet though, it's just a fun thing.
20:02  TRay: Kevin`: Ah that would be interesting
20:02  ovrflw0x: hey kevin
20:03  ovrflw0x: kevin`
20:03 +Kevin`: what?
20:03  ovrflw0x: read above
20:03  ovrflw0x: do you know bash ?
20:03 * Kevin` whines, I don't wanaa
20:03  lockersnatch: lol
20:04  ovrflw0x: i have a fibre cable --> DSL modem --> dlink router w/ dd-wrt on it --> pc
20:04 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: that script looks close enough to shell script that you could use direct equivalents though
20:04  ovrflw0x: it gives command to get ethernet adapters UP
20:04  ovrflw0x: do i need that part in the router?
20:04  xous: iratik: what's your router/gateway?
20:05  ovrflw0x: or i need only the "curl" part?
20:05 +Kevin`: what kind of crappy isp needs a web login to pass traffic
20:05  ovrflw0x: yeah
20:05  ovrflw0x: morons
20:05  iratik: xous: router?  cisco 2600
20:05 +xand: sounds like the wifi you get in cafes etc
20:06  ovrflw0x: kevin` why do i need to check if eth0 is up or not?
20:07 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: I don't know, it's your isp. how does it work?
20:07  ovrflw0x: i showed you the diagram above
20:07  xous: iratik: you need to transparently nat traffic destined to port 80 to your proxy
20:07  ovrflw0x: dsl modem is bridged
20:07  xous: your rule must have an exception for the proxy address
20:07  ovrflw0x: so it's gateway is from ISPs server and not 192.168.0.1
20:07 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: the diagram you showed looks normal though. this stuff is all completely abnormal and specific to your isp
20:07  xous: I'm not familiar enough the cisco nat to provide an example
20:07  ovrflw0x: i cannot get into the DSL modem
20:09  ovrflw0x: Kevin` what i want to do is to "enable" """"Keep Alive""""" and give a "cronjob" to the router

20:14 +Kevin`: well, at least he's running it
20:14 +Kevin`: that's a good first step
20:14  ovrflw0x: kevin` i think what happens is that ... 2 things happen if you are "idle" for 6 hours you get logged out and 2. you *get* logged out after 24 hours no matter *what!*..

20:16 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 171 seconds
20:16 +Kevin`: you have to connect to web pages through a proxy?
20:16 +Kevin`: well I suppose that's to be expected considering the stupid login thing
20:17  ovrflw0x: kevin` that's a workaround to keep connection on w/o hitting that stupid login page
20:18  BlackBishop: any way I could make quagga's ripd announce some ppp interfaces ? :/
20:18 +Kevin`: I still don't see the point in having eth0:1 at all
20:18 +Kevin`: just have clients connect to the LAN ip of your router
20:18  OmNomSequitur: http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/dec/03/dns-ip-ddos-explained
20:18 +Kevin`: I think that configuration is only useful for a standalone desktop
20:19  OmNomSequitur: The news media know what DNS is.
20:19  OmNomSequitur: Interesting.
20:19 +Kevin`: uh-oh
20:19 +Kevin`: that doesn't sound like a good thing for some reason
20:19  OmNomSequitur: They'll be digging around looking for the root servers, next.
20:20  OmNomSequitur: I love when esoteric computing terms enter the mainstream.
20:20  OmNomSequitur: 10 years ago, nobody knew what "upload" or "download" meant.
20:20  OmNomSequitur: Now, a smattering of once-esoteric computing terms are in the common lexicon.
20:20 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: all you
20:20  Dav90: Heyya could anyone help? Sometimes my internet connection disconnects, but the wireless icon on the top right says I'm still connected
20:20 +Kevin`: don't pm me damnit, if it's about the channel discussion
20:20  OmNomSequitur: I expect the NYT to talk about ARP tables next week.
20:21  ovrflw0x: wtf
20:21  Dav90: the disconnecting computer(netbook) is not pingable from other computers when this happens
20:21  ovrflw0x: i thought you know how to freakin solve this thing
20:21 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: all you need to do is the logout/login part, on an otherwise correct router. if your isp is also broken about "multiple clients" you might have to overridde the ttl value of packets, or set up a proxy as mentioned
20:21  OmNomSequitur: Dav90, does the same thing happen over ethernet?
20:21  Dav90: no
20:21  OmNomSequitur: Also, do other wireless nodes have the same problem?
20:22  Dav90: and NOBODY will help me find drivers
20:22  OmNomSequitur: Try updating your wNIC drivers.
20:22  OmNomSequitur: :|
20:22  OmNomSequitur: Maybe the OEM website will help you!
20:22  Dav90: people always say the ar9825 drivers work on ubuntu 10.1 out of the box
20:22  Dav90: and I tried updating and everything
20:22  ovrflw0x: kevin` can i have proxy as a virtual OS?
20:22  ovrflw0x: like in a virtualbox?
20:23  OmNomSequitur: Of course.
20:23 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: why not just run it on the router?
20:23  ovrflw0x: kevin` how?
20:23  ovrflw0x: there's no curl in dd-wrt
20:23 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: openwrt may be easier for this
20:23  ovrflw0x: how to install curl on dd-wrt
20:23 +Kevin`: since you can install packages
20:23 +Kevin`: and I know they have a little proxy server
20:23  ovrflw0x: openwrt does not support dir-600 dlink
20:23 +Kevin`: why? what hardware is it?
20:24  Dav90: OmNomSequitur: I tried installing all the updates but no joy. Could anyone help me troubleshoot this?
20:24 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-600
20:24  ovrflw0x: it is for A1 mine is """B1"""
20:25 +Kevin`: what hardware is in a b1
20:25  ovrflw0x: what?
20:25 +Kevin`: what hardware is in a dir-600 b1
20:26  ovrflw0x: ralink
20:26  ovrflw0x: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Squid_Transparent_Proxy
20:26  Dav90: hey, anyone?
20:26 +Kevin`: Dav90: you might try this, or related trees http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-2.6.git;a=summary
20:27 +Kevin`: all the ath9k stuff at the top looks promising ;p
20:27  Dav90: Kevin`: do I need to uninstall the drivers that come pre-installed with ubuntu, to prevent conflicts?
20:27 +Kevin`: Dav90: nah, installing a new kernel will make it use none of the drivers from the old one
20:27  ovrflw0x: Kevin` http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/DIR-600
20:27  Dav90: Kevin`: thank you, will try it out right now
20:28  AgentCarmichael: xxxx:xxx:xxx:xxx stuff like that, is that an IPv6 addr formatting?
20:28  ovrflw0x: Ralink RT3050 SoC
20:28  ovrflw0x: no
20:28 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: you can probably use wget to replace curl
20:28  xous: Anyone got any comments on this: (yeah, will put in interface names and addresses later)
20:28 +Kevin`: AgentCarmichael: maybe.
20:28  xous: http://anubis.xous.net/~xous/network2.png
20:28  ovrflw0x: no won't work Kevin`
20:28 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: why?
20:29  ovrflw0x: login page is such that wget isn't smart enough as cURL
20:29 +Kevin`: ah
20:29  ovrflw0x: no options available
20:29  Dav90: Kevin`: That's too unfriendly for me :( I am new to ubuntu, and have no idea how to follow the instructions as they are too vague for me
20:29 +Kevin`: there were instructions? :O
20:30 +Kevin`: Dav90: btw, are you sure you aren't hitting the wireless button on your laptop?
20:30 +Kevin`: that would cause exactly what you describe
20:30  Dav90: Kevin`: yes, and I should also mention I have windows7 installed, and it connects to the same WiFi network without problems
20:31  ovrflw0x: Kevin` is there any firmware i can flash my dir-600 router w/ other than dd-wrt?
20:31 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: dunno, i'm not familiar with it. #openwrt perhaps someone will know about it
20:31  Dav90: I have to go now, but I'll be back in about 30 minutes
20:31  Dav90: will you guys still be here?
20:32  ovrflw0x: Kevin` you know how to install curl in dd-wrt?
20:32 +Kevin`: no, I don't use dd-wrt, it's annoying
20:32 +Kevin`: well actually I do have a device running it. but it's just working as an ap
20:33  ovrflw0x: http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Squid_Transparent_Proxy <-- is this link useful ?
20:34 +Kevin`: ovrflw0x: slightly useful. it's not actually running it on the router, but if you want the automatic redirection it's good to know
20:34  ovrflw0x: then how can i get router as proxy?
20:35 +Kevin`: that may be somewhat difficult with dd-wrt since you usually can't install complex software on it
20:35 +Kevin`: have you asked the dd-wrt people? they have a channel here
20:35  ovrflw0x: ys
20:35  ovrflw0x: all r quiet
20:37  gparent: .
20:37  gparent: oops sorry
20:46  zackmax: hey guys... currently doing dynamic DNS hosting with dyndns.org but they require a subscription if I wanted to use my own domain.. is there any other company where I can get free dyndns hosting for my own domain?
20:47  gparent: that doesn't make much sense
20:47  ovrflw0x: Kevin` you there?
20:47  zackmax: i have a dynamic ip adress so i need dynamic dns service like dyndns.org
20:47  gparent: oh
20:47  ovrflw0x: http://privatepaste.com/071285b0c0 <---  where can i put cURL in this script?
20:49  ovrflw0x: it forces dhcp renew if it can't ping routes
20:49  ovrflw0x: later mamn going to sleep
20:50  lockersnatch: zackmax: damn i was thinking that they allowed use of private domains
20:51  zackmax: lockersnatch, they do but they charge $15/year for it
20:51  lockersnatch: zackmax: well, thats not bad
20:51  zackmax: lockersnatch, yes but i'm broke :D
20:51  lockersnatch: zackmax: lol preachin to the choir buddy :)
20:51  zackmax: lol
20:52  lockersnatch: zackmax: id be surprised if anyone would let you do it long term (ie not a trial run) just b/c it knocks out the middle man (ie hosting service)
20:53  lockersnatch: zackmax: would be really nice though i agree
20:53  zackmax: lockersnatch, looking at dnsexit .. i think they do it for free
20:53  lockersnatch: zackmax: really, checking it out now...
20:58  xous: zackmax: freedns.afraid.org
21:00  zackmax: xous, yeah i saw that one too... i just signed up for dnsexit.. i'll try both
21:04  Dav9: Hey, could anyone help now?
21:05  zackmax: yayy.. dnsexit works great and its FREE!! :D
21:05  Dav9: I installed ubuntu on my netbook, it appears to connect successfully, but frequently, internet disconnects. When this happens, it is unreachable and unpingable from other computers in the network.
21:06  Dav9: I also have win7 installed on the netbook, it connects to the internet without problems, never disconnected.
21:06  Dav9: Could anyone help me with this?
21:06  zackmax: Dav9, whatkind of internet u got.. dsl or cable?
21:07  zackmax: and are you connecting to net directly or thru wireless router?
21:07  Dav9: DSL, but I never had this problem before, in fact 3 computers connect without problems, including an ubuntu one
21:07  Dav9: wireless
21:07  zackmax: so this is a wireless problem
21:07  Dav9: the "working" ubuntu one, is also wireless
21:07  zackmax: maybe its not renewing keys on time
21:07  Dav9: very probably, yes
21:07  zackmax: you're using WPA ?
21:07  Dav9: wpa2
21:08  zackmax: did u try switching it to something else and see if it happened?
21:08  Dav9: I wouldn't use wep when there are tools like backtrack around
21:08  zackmax: u can try regular WPA with PSK or something
21:08  zackmax: just to test
21:08  Dav9: nope
21:08  Dav9: ok
21:08  zackmax: well you need to test if its WPA2 that's the problem.. if it is then u can try reinstalling it
21:08  Dav9: by the way, I asked for help many many times, but nobody ever helped me find my driver
21:09  zackmax: i have not troubleshot wireless on linux but lets see what we can do
21:09  Dav9: atheros ar9285, using ath9k
21:09  zackmax: have you googled to see if anyone came across the same problem?
21:09  Dav9: I have spent days googling
21:10  zackmax: so you have 2 ubuntu systems and 1 windows system .. but only one ubuntu is having this problem
21:10  Dav9: yep
21:10  Dav9: the other one worked flawlessly
21:10  zackmax: the other ubuntu is also a netbook?
21:10  Dav9: nope,desktop
21:10  Dav9: with PCI ralink Wireless
21:10  zackmax: so different drivers right
21:10  Dav9: yeah
21:11  zackmax: and you already tried reinstalling drivers on the netbook
21:11  Dav9: no, I never found any
21:11  zackmax: i'm sure there's a package which u can just apt-get
21:12  zackmax: but ubuntu usually has gui configuration for everything
21:12  zackmax: even wireless
21:12  Dav9: I don't mind terminal
21:12  Dav9: if you can tell me the package name, would be great to try
21:12  Dav9: ethernet works without any problems
21:12  Dav9: wireless is a real nightmare on ubuntu
21:12  zackmax: i wuldn't know.. u know ur wireless adapter so the best answer u'll get is from good u can go to the manufac site and see if they have linux drivers.. if not just search for them online or thru apt
21:13  zackmax: google*
21:13  zackmax: but i would still advise u to switch it from wpa2 to wap and just test to see if u get the same issue
21:13  zackmax: wpa*
21:14  Dav9: I can try, but if I still get the issue I won't be able to find drivers anyway
21:14  Dav9: I already tried
21:15  Dav9: ok I did it the router is rebooting
21:15  zackmax: try it for sake of trying.. it sucks that u havn't gotten anything from linuxquestions, linuxforums, or ubuntuforums bcuz those are the best places.. they usually have threads on almost every issue
21:15  Dav9: never got from ubuntuforums
21:15  Dav9: I mean I actually posted there
21:16  zackmax: i dunno what to tell you  mate.. i myself am waiting for chrome OS before i buy a netbook
21:16 --- sl33v3_ is now known as sl33v3
21:16  Dav9: Ehh, could anyone else help me with this?
21:16  Ox1: so `iwconfig -a` is empty?
21:17  Dav9: let me check
21:17  Dav9: yes
21:17  Dav9: -a no such device
21:17  Ox1: pastebin lspci
21:17  Ox1: huh
21:18  Ox1: err, just iwconfig
21:18  Ox1: =/
21:18  Dav9: iwconfig shows that I am connected, bitRate 81Mb/s, correct network name, on wlan0
21:19  Dav9: I'll pastebin lspci
21:19  Ox1: no need to
21:19  Ox1: forget that
21:19  Dav9: ifconfig shows that I am assigned an IP address
21:19  Ox1: so the wlan interface is working
21:19  Dav9: but I am not fooled
21:19  zackmax: lol
21:19  Dav9: this IP is not accessible, nor pingable from any other pc from the network
21:20  Ox1: what is the  problem than?
21:20  Ox1: oh
21:20  Dav9: lol
21:20  Ox1: how is this related to drivers -.-
21:20  zackmax: so its giving u an ip which is not accessible.. is it like an apipa thingy
21:20  Dav9: It's saying I'm connected when I'm not
21:20  Dav9: I guess it's a partially working driver
21:20  Ox1: no
21:20  Dav9: because sometimes it actually connects
21:20  Ox1: restart the interface/network
21:21  Dav9: I did that many many times, it just connects for a while( sometimes) then just .. internet stops working again
21:21  Ox1: pastebin `route -n`
21:21  Ox1: stops working again?
21:22  Ox1: meaning it worked at some point?
21:22  Dav9: I have another pc on the network that has the same version of ubuntu, connected to the same network, using wireless, and it works fine
21:22  Dav9: yeah, it works sometimes
21:22  Dav9: so I guess it's a driver problem
21:22  Ox1: no
21:22  Ox1: check dmesg
21:22  Dav9: ok, I'll paste those
21:22  Ox1: dn't
21:22  Ox1: just look for suspicious lines
21:23  Ox1: sounds like faulty NIC
21:23  Dav9: oh yeah
21:23  Ox1: how old is it?
21:23  Dav9: and this netbook also has windows7
21:23  Dav9: and internet works -absolutely fine- on it
21:23  Ox1: model?
21:23  LzrdKing: http://amasci.com/elect//poynt/poynt.html
21:24  Dav9: atheros ar-9285
21:24  LzrdKing: does the internet work like this, too?
21:24  Ox1: netbook model
21:24  Dav9: ??
21:24  Dav9: it's an EEPC
21:25  Dav9: but I don't know exactly
21:25  Dav9: is there a way I can check?
21:25  Dav9: EEEPC
21:25  Ox1: it should work
21:25  gulum: how can i get a list of all the computers connected to network?
21:27  Dav9: ok, I tried disconnecting my wifi and reconnecting and running dmesg while trying to load a page
21:27  Dav9: it just says
21:27  Ox1: you're better off going to #ubuntu
21:27  Dav9: wlan0 authenticated, wlan0 associated, wlan0:link becomes ready
21:27  Dav9: they sent me here >.<
21:28  Ox1: because afaik it is working
21:28  Dav9: so could it be a network config problem?
21:28  Dav9: I have a fresh install
21:28  Ox1: unless there's interference making it drop
21:28  Ox1: go sit next to the AP
21:28  Dav9: will do right now
21:28  zackmax: Dav9, also change it back to wpa2 if wpa didn't help
21:29  Dav9: oh yeah, I forgot to tell you, it didn't work =\
21:29  Dav9: same problem exactly
21:29  Dav9: I'm using it right now in fact
21:29  zackmax: change it back then... it is sounding like a driver issue for that specific wireless adapter on ubuntu
21:29  zackmax: whichnetbook is it?
21:29  Dav9: the thing is, ethernet works fine
21:29  Dav9: EEEPC
21:30  zackmax: ethernet and wireless adapters are separate
21:30  zackmax: eeepc .. what is model?
21:30  Dav9: is there a command to check, or should I go look in the garage for the box?
21:31  Ox1: please do that
21:31  Dav9: ok =\
21:31  Ox1: while you're at it, google yourself  whetehr there's a known problem with that model
21:33  zackmax1: ahh my system crashed
21:34  Ox1: here, have a cookie
21:34  zackmax1: thank you
21:34  zackmax1: now i lost my nick and have to recover it
21:34  zackmax1: lol
21:35  Ox1: or wait for timeout
21:35  zackmax1: yes good idea
21:35  zackmax1: Dav9 issue fixed?
21:35  Dav9: Asus Eee PC 1080HA
21:36  Ox1: not afaik
21:36  Ox1: ah
21:36  Ox1: that's the netbook i wanted
21:36  zackmax1: that looks nice
21:37  Ox1: yeah
21:37  Dav9: ehh, I still can't figure this out
21:37  zackmax1: here's someone complaining too
21:37  zackmax1: http://www.overclockers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=545106
21:38  Dav9: but nobody seems to have my exact issue
21:38  Dav9: it doesn't stay on "pending"
21:38  Ox1: http://forum.eeebuntu.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=3019
21:38  Dav9: it connects
21:40  Ox1: your best bet would be try a more recent kernel
21:40  Ox1: just rough guess
21:40  Dav9: could you say that at a simpler level?
21:40  zackmax1: wanna try latest fedora?
21:40  Dav9: I'm using 10.1
21:40  Dav9: and 10.4 also gave me that problem
21:41  Ox1: im afraid i don't know  how to rephrase that
21:41  Dav9: well, I think I'll try
21:41  Dav9: you mean a different linux OS/
21:41  Ox1: not necessarily
21:41  zackmax1: he meant u can update the kernel
21:41  Dav9: how do I install a more recent kernel? doesn't 10.1 have the most recent kernel?
21:41  Ox1: doubt it
21:41  zackmax1: no i wouldn't think so
21:42  Ox1: before attempting it, verify it's worth trying or not
21:42  Dav9: so what do you suggest?
21:42  Dav9: how should I install the kernel?
21:42  Ox1: as in compare what you're running or tried against the changelog of more recent if not currrent kernel release
21:43  Dav9: I don't know if it's a driver or a network problem
21:43  Ox1: did you try sitting next to AP?
21:43  Dav9: that's what makes it so difficult
21:43  Dav9: yes, it worked then stopped working
21:43  Ox1: can you change security to WEP?
21:44  Ox1: for testing
21:44  Dav9: but look, other ubuntu computers connected from right next to it, without problems
21:44  Dav9: even a smartphone can
21:44  Dav9: ok, let's try
21:44  Ox1: that's not helping much
21:44  Ox1: =/
21:44  zackmax1: i can tell you now this is a problem with that specific model of that specific wireless adapter with those specific linux drivers.. or they could just be ubuntu specific drivers... that's why i asked if u wanted to try fedora
21:44  Dav9: I mean, I am typing this on a Wi-fi desktop
21:45  Dav9: and have the netbook right next to me
21:45  Ox1: there's no ubuntu specific drivers afaik
21:45  Ox1: support is built-in kernel
21:45  Ox1: as in comes with
21:45  zackmax1: i was under the impression that canonical team tweaked drivers for certain hardware
21:45  zackmax1: i heard wrong then
21:45  Dav9: I have spent alot of time installing programs, and I simply love ubuntu
21:45  Dav9: I'll leave that as a last resort
21:46  Dav9: look, it would be great if you can be a bit more specific
21:46  Ox1: maybe, i could be wrong
21:46  Dav9: where to download drivers, and instructions
21:46  Dav9: that are simple
21:46  Dav9: and which ones to donwload
21:46  Ox1: Dav9: i'm afraid i can't give you any specific instruction
21:46  Ox1: even if i could there's no guarantee it will solve your problem
21:47  Dav9: it wouldn't hurt to try
21:47  Dav9: what can I lose
21:47  Ox1: all i can say is, try getting latest testing kernel
21:47  Ox1: ask in #ubuntu for that
21:47  Ox1: haven't used ubuntu in years
21:47  Dav9: what do you use?
21:47  Ox1: arch linux
21:48  Ox1: can you do uname -a?
21:49  Dav9: ok
21:49  zackmax1: i wanna take a guess... 2.6.18 :d
21:49  Dav9: I have other computers connected, I can't change it to wep for now
21:49  Dav9: because people are complaining
21:49  freedarandy_: who has authority to specify the IP address of a domain name to a top level domain server?
21:50  zackmax1: freedarandy_ the owner of the domain
21:50  Dav9: Linux davidubuntu 2.6.35-23-generic #40-Ubuntu SMP Wed Nov 17 22:15:35 UTC 2010 1686 GNU/Linux
21:50  freedarandy_: zackmax1, yes, i didn't phrase my question properly though
21:50  Ox1: LTS 10.1?
21:50  Dav9: ?
21:51  Ox1: ubuntu 10.1
21:51  Dav9: yeah
21:51  Dav9: so, I left you clueless?
21:51  zackmax1: lol
21:52  zackmax1: well how important is it to get this thing working... i know u installed a whole bunch of programs but its worth a shot to try another more recent version of a distro.. i'm sure u can get most if not all your programs back
21:52  Dav9: you know, it's frustrating... I've been trying to fix it for a week now
21:52  freedarandy_: if you are running your own name server for your own domain, how do you get the top-level domain name server to recognize your name server ?
21:52  Dav9: yep youre right
21:52  Dav9: so can I install playonlinux on fedora?
21:53  Dav9: which can run a full version of office 2007?
21:53  zackmax1: freedarandy_ on the registrar's website you have to specify that.. there's always option for that
21:53  freedarandy_: do you always have to go through a registrar, or can you do it directly with Network Solutions?
21:53  zackmax1: Dav9 I am not sure but lets google it
21:54  zackmax1: Dav9: http://www.playonlinux.com/en/commentaires-458.html
21:54  zackmax1: freedarandy_ you registered the domain thru netsol? netsol is a registrar itself so yes u can do it thru there too .. log into your account and there should be an option specify nameservers
21:55  Dav9: I'll try
21:55  zackmax1: meaning "creating nameservers"
21:55  gulum: what's netbios? i've heard that it's a tool to look at the network, but i don't fully get it
21:56  zackmax1: gulum, it was something stupid created by msft which has single label domains and hostnames and it was pretty much a failure
21:57  freedarandy_: zackmax1, according to http://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns2.htm, network solutions is the top-level authority for the list of domain names
21:57  zackmax1: freedarandy_, i thought it was interNIC or IANA
21:57  freedarandy_: translation: how do i save money by avoiding a) registrar costs and b) ISP name servicing costs?
21:58  freedarandy_: i know the answer to b) is to create and maintain my own public nameserver
21:58  freedarandy_: a) i'm not sure of
21:58  freedarandy_: it may be moot - godaddy'
21:58  freedarandy_: godaddy's rates are pretty reasonable usually
21:59  freedarandy_: my questions are half academic, half economic
22:00  CartoonCat: freedarandy_: you can not avoid using a registrar, dnspark or such services will make your DNS free
22:00  FP|Maverick-work: you can becore a registrar and get domains even cheaper
22:00  FP|Maverick-work: but I imagine there are other costs to go with that
22:00  CartoonCat: FP|Maverick-work: as i said, you can not avoid using a registrar.
22:01  CartoonCat: using yourself, is still using
22:01  freedarandy_: right
22:01 +Kevin`: freedarandy_: if you use a subdomain you can usually get it for free
22:01  CartoonCat: Kevin`: thats true, dyndns and such have plenty of name space for free
22:02  freedarandy_: CartoonCat, although have you noticed that about a couple of months ago dyndns started forcing monthly revisits to keep your domain alive?
22:03  freedarandy_: without paying. of course for a small fee...
22:03  FP|Maverick-work: 1 domain is so cheap
22:03  FP|Maverick-work: then you got unlimited subdomains
22:03  freedarandy_: as i said, half-academic
22:03  FP|Maverick-work: I guess it also depends on the TLD
22:04  FP|Maverick-work: since they all have their own policies
22:04  freedarandy_: if you go to godaddy, why are some domains more expensive than others?
22:04  CartoonCat: freedarandy_: not at all, i have my own FQDN's
22:04  freedarandy_: domain names, that is
22:04  FP|Maverick-work: because each TLD set different prices
22:04  ecrane: freedarandy_: Ask godaddy, why ask us!!??
22:06  freedarandy_: CartoonCat, what are you referring to by "not at all"?
22:06  CartoonCat: [13:02:17] <freedarandy_> CartoonCat, although have you noticed that about a couple of months ago dyndns started forcing monthly revisits to keep your domain alive?
22:06  CartoonCat: no, had not noticed it at all
22:06  freedarandy_: oh
22:06  freedarandy_: you threw me
22:07  freedarandy_: (not that that's hard to do...)
22:07  CartoonCat: you a feather weight eh? toss ya in the javel throw
22:08  freedarandy_: FP|Maverick-work, but even within, e.g., .com, it seems that some domains are much more expensive than others. why?
22:08  freedarandy_: CartoonCat, ha
22:08  freedarandy_: only mentally - physically i'm 210 lbs
22:09  CartoonCat: freedarandy_: are you talking the domain auctions? thats cause the people who have them want to sell them for more. any open domain is worth $10
22:09  freedarandy_: maybe that's it
22:09  zackmax1: I really wanted a domain which auctioned for $500 but the guy who bought it never did anything and forgot to renew.. so i got it from namecheap for $8 as soon as it expired
22:10  freedarandy_: sweet
22:10  freedarandy_: ok, thanks all for the answers
22:10  freedarandy_: l8r
22:10  CartoonCat: zackmax1: nice nice.
22:11  zackmax1: and another one... this guy was seling the domain.. i sent him and emial and he demanded $600... i said i'll give u $100.. then we haggled and he didn't agree.. 2 months later i emailed him again and we agreed on $200
22:11  zackmax1: but i changed my mind and didn't pay him
22:12  zackmax1: an year later he couldn't sell it to no one and it expired
22:12  zackmax1: and i got it thru namecheap
22:12  zackmax1: then i sent him an email
22:12  zackmax1: and the response he sent was probably the most hiliarious email i've ever received
22:12  zackmax1: haha
22:13  ecrane: I had a domain I wanted really bad. I watched it expiring, etc.
22:13  zackmax1: that's the best thing to do cuz they eventually expire lol
22:14  ecrane: In the end I paid stupidass network solutions an extra $30 to snag it for me... because it was reserved with them before and I was worried someone else would be able to snatch it with their stupid service unless I did it first.
22:14  zackmax1: oh
22:14  zackmax1: u mean like backordering.. in case the ownder forgets to renew?
22:14  ecrane: yah.
22:14  zackmax1: oh ok.. namecheap as that too
22:15  zackmax1: but that's also like $8
22:15  zackmax1: that service i mean
22:16  ecrane: Network Solutions is /supposed/ to play fair and interoperate with other registrars, but I was worried I would lose it. (the domain was registered with them and getting expired by them, so I was worried someone else buying their stupid backorder service would get it before it was released to the 'public pool' as it were)
22:16  zackmax1: ohhh ok i understand now
22:16  zackmax1: yeah i think they do play favorites
22:16  zackmax1: domain names were such a big business just 5 years ago.. they still are to an extent
22:17  ecrane: I've been using dotster and I'm pissed... they slowly raise their prices a few dollars a year. Gonna switch soon.
22:17  zackmax1: namecheap's always been good
22:17  ecrane: ok, thanks for the recommendation.
22:17  zackmax1: i've been with namecheap forever.. i'd say 10 years
22:17  zackmax1: or more
22:19  ish10: hey guys i need to write a script that ssh's to a machine and runs a command on it. Is this possible with BASH?
22:20  gparent: I thought ssh supported that built-in as a command argument
22:20  gparent: like su
22:22  KB1JWQ: It does. :-)
22:22  KB1JWQ: ish10: In real world terms, what're you trying to do?
22:22  KB1JWQ: ish10: Not to mention that ##linux is a likely better place to ask.
22:24  ish10: KB1JWQ, oh my bad for askign wrong channel. I have 22 machines and want to write a script that runs aptitude on it to install a program
22:26 +xand: ssh login@machine "run some command"
22:27  ish10: works fine, except when i need sudo
22:31  devdvd: ish10, the only way that will work with sudo is if the account is set to run the command with nopasswd
22:33  ish10: devdvd, not true. I just found a way to do it with rsync
22:34 +xand: wtf
22:34 +xand: rsync has nothing to do with sudo
22:52  ish10: xand, yea it does
22:55 +xand: uhuh
23:05  lockersnatch: ish10: why do you say rsync has anything to do with sudo?
23:06  ish10: lockersnatch, --rsync_path
23:07  lockersnatch: man rsync
23:08 --- sw0rdfish_ is now known as sw0rdfish
23:08  lockersnatch: "does not require super user privileges"
23:19  ish10: loser you cant do things that require sudo on the other machine
23:20  ish10: try rsync on ur fstab from one machine to another to fstab
23:26 +xand: root with ssh key for auth.
23:29  ish10: ubuntu doenst have a root user
23:30  lockersnatch: not by default...by it can easily be enabled
23:31  lockersnatch: *but it can be
23:32  ish10: u mean sudo -i?
23:33 +xand: ish10: yes it does.
23:33 +xand: you just don't know the password.
23:33  lockersnatch: http://www.debianadmin.com/enable-and-disable-ubuntu-root-password.html
23:33 +xand: the password is just set to a random one at install time
23:34  hideo: really?  hahah they don't trust their users that much
23:36  lockersnatch: i think its b/c they are trying to make it more secure (for lack of a better word) for new/intermediate users who wish to migrate to linux w/ the warm and fuzzy feel of gui
23:39  lockersnatch: anybody hear recently about fed ex losing a shipment of enriched uranium
23:39  ish10: holy crap. really? how much?
23:39  TRay: That's why I use UPS to send my enriched uranium.
23:40  lockersnatch: i cant remember how much...they claimed that it a small enough amount where it would only cause radiation poisoning with "prolonged" exposure, but who knows really
23:40  ish10: lol it might just be like a few mg of it
23:41  lockersnatch: still...who the hell send EU via fed ex
23:41  lockersnatch: *sends...sry cant type today...
23:41  ish10: it was probably with a batch of materials for use of study by universities
23:41  lockersnatch: that is what they claimed...bit still...come on people
23:41  lockersnatch: *but still...ok, thats it, im done
23:42  ish10: oh lol if its a uni, then its definitely a very very small amount
23:42  ish10: uni students just handle it with their bare hands
23:43  ish10: it comes in like a protective round plastic capsule
23:43  lockersnatch: ehhh...they were pretty frantic in trying to find it if i remember correctly...suggested that, "If you accidentally receive it, please dont handle it"
23:43  hideo: undergraduates == lab monkeys
