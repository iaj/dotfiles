00:01  adurotec: jumbo does bring to mind some awfully offensive things, but I as referring to MTU sizes larger than 1500...lol
00:03  adurotec: im looking into configuring my switches to use jumbo frames so I can set my Linux hosts NIC to MTU of 9k (along with some other kernel tweaks) and was hoping to find anyone who has deployed the use of jumbo frames
00:12  wolfric: does anyone know if there's any software out there for making virtual networks (emulating multiple layers of physically connected computers)
00:12 --- mrcrilly is now known as crilly
00:24  \malex\: wolfric: most VM software has some sort of a networking component
00:26  CMI-DOS: \malex\: he is talking about VPNs not VMs

12:46 --- Server: [card.freenode.net] [freenode-info] if you're at a conference and other people are having trouble connecting, please mention it to staff: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#gettinghelp
12:47  crilly: I'm not sure I understand the problem. You're running out of IPs in the 10/8 address space? You have more than 16 million clients?
12:48 +xand: no..
12:48  Mekkis: crilly, no, we have several clients
12:48  frogzoo: oh this is your vpn space - mpls is overkill, just nat is fine
12:48 +xand: sounds like the different VPN services use the same address ranges.
12:48  Mekkis: each of whose sysadmins came up with their own addressing regimes
12:48  Mekkis: if you can call it that
12:48  crilly: Oh. And these are colliding now?
12:49  Mekkis: yeah
12:49  frogzoo: it's basically why nat was invented
12:49  Mekkis: but only from our perspective, because we need to talk to all of them
12:49 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 165 seconds
12:50  crilly: So you connect to their VPN, all their IPs in that VPN's broadcast domain are "becoming" apart of your network?
12:50  Mekkis: yes, firewalling notwithstanding
12:52  crilly: hmm
12:53  frogzoo: just nat already, moving on..
12:54  crilly: I can't picture how that works in my head.
12:54  xingu: badly. :)
12:54  Mekkis: barely :S
12:55 * xingu wonders how many people who number out of rfc1918 space have actually read it
12:55  frogzoo: 3?
12:55  crilly: Yeah so it seems. I'm trying to work out what his network topology must be for such collisions to occur.
12:58  crilly: If you use 10/8, for example, for your internal hosts and DHCP assigns IPs accordingly, where do the collisions come in when a VPN connection is made to a remote network? Is it because the one router has two entires for the same IP, if the remote side behind the VPN is also using 10/8? I assume both routers are sharing their routing tables and find that both have entries for 10/8 IPs?
13:00  crilly: ANd how does NAT come into it? Basically presenting a different IP to the remote network behind the VPN, inside of the entire 10/8 set of IPs?
13:01  xingu: smells like a service provider scenario, one ignorant of the rfc; so (the eponymous) "they" have constructed an abomination of inter-enterprise transit areas numbered from private space without the requisite inter-enterprise co-ordination.
13:01  frogzoo: the point is the customers pick the allocation, & you have no control over that, specially if you have half a dozen allocating 10.0.0
13:02  Mekkis: basically what frogzoo said
13:02  xingu: the solution per rfc is simple - renumber one side or the other to avoid the collision
13:03  Mekkis: xingu, right. The issue there is that we have control over neither of them
13:03  xingu: or, get some provider independent space and use your own numbering plan
13:03  xingu: Mekkis: which kind of begs the question - why abuse the address space, then?
13:04  Mekkis: I'm not sure I understand your question
13:04  xingu: the rfc's pretty lucid
13:04  crilly: OK, but now I want to understand how the collisions work from a technical point of view. Using the VPN link, how are the two spaces addressed now?
13:04  frogzoo: one possible alternative is to insist the vpns get terminated on public IPs
13:05  xingu: crilly: MSP x (ab)uses rfc1918 internally; then constructs an overlay network to clients A and B; clients A and B overlap with each other, and, possibly MSP x's own internal plan
13:05  frogzoo: but really for a bunch of vpns, nat is perfectly serviceable with proper dns
13:05  xingu: crilly: neither MSP x nor client A nor client B have read the RFC, so it is *assumed* that neither party will renumber
13:07  xingu: happens more often than I care to think about; as much as I hate the control freakery inherent in the statement, sometimes mandating behaviour (in this case, forcing people to work with a centralised registry) really is for their own good
13:07  xingu: twice-nat/ d-nat is one way to embed the stupidity into all three->N networks forever
13:07  crilly: That sound silly to me. Why would Client A (C-A) and Client B (C-B) overlap? Why is Mekkis' VPN merging those two networks into the same collision domain? Surely both C-A and C-B should be on individual collision domains and hence, only a conflict between Mekkis' network and either C-A and C-B can occur individually and not between each other as a whole?
13:08  Mekkis: the conflict doesn't occur between C-A and C-B, as they're not connected
13:09  crilly: OK. That's just how I read xingu's explanation.
13:09  Mekkis: the conflict occurs when we want to talk to C-A's 192.168.2.5 (for example), but we're connected to C-A and C-B
13:09  xingu: crilly: it's as absurd as it seems; the merge is probably in x's namespace rather than numbering (ie, they have hard dependancies on the locator rather than the identifier)
13:09  crilly: Mekkis: Oh!
13:10  crilly: Mekkis: So you have two instances of the same IP in both C-A and C-B's network?
13:10  Mekkis: so it's 'only' our problem
13:10  Mekkis: yeah
13:10  xingu: crilly: not only two instances of the locator but also a nailed-up dependancy between identifier and locator, I'd wager.
13:10  crilly: Now I understand. Yeah, how would you router know where to pass the packet on. Hmm.
13:10  crilly: xingu: No idea what you're on about buddy.
13:11  xingu: crilly: the golden question is "why does the *address* matter" ?
13:11  crilly: Mekkis: I think I agree with the others when I say one possible fix is to NAT your internal network.
13:11  crilly: xingu: Which one, the remote one? Because it is needed to communicate to the other host on the IP network.
13:11  Mekkis: I was looking into some form of 1:1 NAT to "remap" the client's IPs
13:12  xingu: Mekkis: aka twice nat or destination nat + source nat
13:12  xingu: Mekkis: it's a great way to pay a per-packet cost forever
13:12  xingu: and it's as fragile as hell
13:12  crilly: Why not simply NAT your own network and have a public facing IP to play with?
13:12  xingu: now we're getting somewhere
13:13  xingu: then, why NAT at all? use PI address space.
13:13  crilly: Then you have a public IP going into a private IP space - no conflict.
13:13  xingu: and number your vpn yourself
13:13  xingu: crilly: he's still using client address plans on the client transit areas; it's not only the spokes/tunnels, its the things he wishes to hit on the far end of them
13:14  crilly: hmm
13:15  crilly: yeah that's a tough one. especially for someone like me - my networking knowledge is pretty dumb at the minute.
13:15  xingu: hence destination nat; but that's costly and fragile.
13:15  xingu: think about what happens when one of two client gateways goes boom.
13:15  crilly: So it's not the end-to-end connection that's the issue, it's once the two networks have "merged"
13:16  xingu: yup.
13:16  Mekkis: how costly are we talking?
13:16  crilly: billions
13:16  crilly: but i'll do it for a illion
13:16  xingu: per-packet rewrite down to about 64bytes deep or thereabouts
13:16  crilly: and a million
13:16  xingu: for every packet there and back
13:16  crilly: that's CPU heavy right?
13:16  crilly: doesn't that call for sexy hardware?
13:17  Mekkis: isn't that what NAT-PT (for example) does?
13:17  xingu: nat-pt solves a different problem (vpn behind nat)
13:17  xingu: anyway
13:17 * xingu vanishes
13:18  xingu: src+destination nat is probably in your future
13:18  xingu: at least use prefix nat for both, save yourself some heartache
13:18  crilly: Or only connect to a single client at a time... or split your intertnal network up into smaller subnets?
13:18  crilly: WOuld that work?
13:18  OmNomSequitur: What's the consensus on using DNS aliases for specific services, instead of actual host names?
13:19  Mekkis: crilly, only as a short-term solution
13:19  OmNomSequitur: Let's say you have a server you wish to use for hosting mail. Do you name it "mail" or name it whatever and then create a DNS alias?
13:20  crilly: Mekkis: I see. As your number of clients grow, you'll see more collisions. D'oh
13:20  Mekkis: indeed
13:28  jjlee: I have a switch but no router.  The hardware provided by my ISP to connect to their cable network insists on only talking to one MAC address.  So ideally I'd like a tiny little box with just 2 ethernet ports, one to connect to the router, and the other to my switch, to route the IP packets.  Does such a thing exist?  Most of the routers you see are physically fairly big.
13:29  gongoputch: OmNomSequitur: mail is kind of a special case, a lot of MX hosts check that PTR = A
13:29  jjlee: It would also be nice if I didn't need yet another little power supply for it, but I guess there's no way around that.
13:29  gongoputch: http servers LIVE on CNAMEs however
13:31 --- Mark_ is now known as grid_
13:31  jjlee: Failing that, can anybody recommend a physically small router (with two or more ethernet ports)?
13:33  gongoputch: COTS NET/routers are small
13:33  gongoputch: (Commercial Off The Shelf)
13:34  gongoputch: plus, MAC is layer 2, your ISP probably only deals you one IP as well. You will have to route anyway in that case.
13:35  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, the majority of home routers come with four ethernet ports.
13:35  OmNomSequitur: Just choose between ADSL and cable.
13:36  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: I'm not proposing to change the box that connects to the cable network (don't think I'm supposed to do that).
13:37  OmNomSequitur: That's your modem.
13:37  OmNomSequitur: You connect your router to the cable modem, then you connect your PCs to the router.
13:37  gongoputch: go get a cheap netgear or linksys
13:39  jjlee: people seem to object to the name "modem" for that device (though I guess it does in fact modulate and demodulate)
13:40  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: indeed you do.  I do not have a router.  My question is about which router to purchase.
13:41  gongoputch: jjlee: 'modem' is even more overloaded than 'switch'
13:41  jjlee: gongoputch: you're probably right re getting a "cheap netgear or linksys", but what I've seem so seem a). not to be very cheap and b) fairly large (hard to tell at a glance how big they are though)
13:41  gongoputch: jjlee: just about any COTS 'router' will handle the nominal cases
13:41  OmNomSequitur: Home routers should be about $25.
13:42  jjlee: gongoputch: functionally maybe, but I guess it has a straightforward technical meaning
13:42  gongoputch: 25? where do you live? :)
13:42  OmNomSequitur: And they're about the size of a 3.5" HDD.
13:42  OmNomSequitur: UK.
13:42  OmNomSequitur: A router costs about £17 here.
13:42  OmNomSequitur: Ok that's more like $27.
13:42  gongoputch: ~ $50 here
13:42  OmNomSequitur: -damn-
13:43  OmNomSequitur: These are wireless routers, too.
13:43  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: that's interesting!  I'm in the UK, and the ones I have seen are much more expensive.  Can you give an example, please?
13:43  OmNomSequitur: Are tiy ub tge YS?
13:43  OmNomSequitur: Are you in the US?
13:43  OmNomSequitur: :A
13:43  OmNomSequitur: :|
13:43 * OmNomSequitur realigns keyboard
13:43  gongoputch: Delaware, USA
13:44  gongoputch: jjlee: many people 'roll their own' routers
13:44  OmNomSequitur: jjlee: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/169923 All-in-one router, switch and access point.
13:44  OmNomSequitur: For £17.
13:44  OmNomSequitur: Sure, it's a piece of shit.
13:44  OmNomSequitur: But it's quite cheap.
13:44  gongoputch: they all are
13:44  gongoputch: I object to calling NAT devices a 'router'
13:45  OmNomSequitur: Eh, Cisco routers with 4+ GbE switch ports are expensive.
13:45  gongoputch: they don't Route, they NAT
13:45  OmNomSequitur: They route internally...
13:45  OmNomSequitur: That's if you have more than one node, duh.
13:45  jjlee: gongoputch: "rolling your own" would presumably use more electrical power than a "COTS" one
13:45  OmNomSequitur: Also, it may explode, jjlee.
13:45  OmNomSequitur: I'd rather spend £30 on something I knew wouldn't explode.
13:46  Mekkis: jjlee, depends if the machine's already on 24/7
13:46  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: sorry, don't follow you
13:46  gongoputch: also, I hate Hate HATE the non intelligent 'switches' they have inside
13:46  gongoputch: I prefer a hub to a switch without mirror port capability
13:46  OmNomSequitur: What do you expect for £17?
13:46  OmNomSequitur: Heh.
13:46  OmNomSequitur: How many home users need to mirror ports?
13:46  OmNomSequitur: How many home users know what port mirroring is?
13:47  gongoputch: any one I have to support
13:47  OmNomSequitur: Yes, but these are home users.
13:47  OmNomSequitur: And if somebody needs to mirror ports, they're going to buy a discrete switch.
13:47  gongoputch: I actually overflow the MAC table to fail them over into hubs
13:47  OmNomSequitur: A good one. Not some SOHO junk.
13:47  OmNomSequitur: Heh.
13:47  gongoputch: so I can watch
13:47  OmNomSequitur: Hubs.
13:47  OmNomSequitur: So anyway, jjlee, how much do you want to spend?
13:48  jjlee: gongoputch, what is the intended purpose of the "intelligent 'switches'" you refer to?
13:48  OmNomSequitur: He meants managed or smart switches.
13:48  OmNomSequitur: *means
13:48  gongoputch: jjlee: debugging
13:48  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: as little as possible to do what I want without too much pain
13:48  OmNomSequitur: You debug your switches?
13:48  gongoputch: OmNomSequitur
13:48  OmNomSequitur: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/48546 This model's variants are used all over the UK by Virgin and Sky. It's only Wireless G, though.
13:49  gongoputch: OmNomSequitur's point is quite valid that you don;t need to worry about it.
13:49  gongoputch: until you do
13:49  OmNomSequitur: gongoputch, you want to waste jjlee's money?
13:49  gongoputch: but at that point you can just throw it away and buy another
13:49  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, gongoputch is talking about enterprise/business features which no home user will ever use.
13:49  gongoputch: no, I want to hit the manufacturers over the head
13:50  OmNomSequitur: I mean really, show me a home user who had the expertise to analyse mirrored port data but couldn't afford a HP switch.
13:50  gongoputch: I have been called in to look at odd networking issues for a LOT of "home users"
13:51  gongoputch: and many of the cheapest net/routers have weirdo issues like dropping carrier for some of the cheaper NICs
13:51  OmNomSequitur: jjlee: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/201376 This is £20, reduced from £40. It's Wireless N. Buy it.
13:51  FabTG_: hi everyone, to surf everywhere from my working place, what is the best solution: a proxy socks under a ssh tunnel or an http proxy (squid) under a ssh tunnel ?
13:51  OmNomSequitur: gongoputch, you do home-based tech support?
13:52  gongoputch: not for money, but as a matter of nessesity
13:52  OmNomSequitur: You don't need the money?
13:52  gongoputch: I need our partners and contractors to be able to interract with us
13:52  gongoputch: (we are small)
13:53  jacekowski: FabTG_: you go to work to work there not browse internet
13:53  gongoputch: I guess there is little middleground between cheap crap that nearly works and expensive enterprise stuff
13:54  jacekowski: gongoputch: not really
13:54  jacekowski: it's either cheap crap
13:54  jacekowski: expensive crap
13:54  jacekowski: or very expensive decent stuff
13:54  gongoputch: lol
13:54  jacekowski: but expensive crap and cheap crap is manufactured in one and same chinese factory
13:55  OmNomSequitur: jacekowski, SOHO routers are a middle ground.
13:55  gongoputch: one day I will get motivated enough to build a dozen soekris routers ...
13:55  jjlee: OmNomSequitur, thanks for the links.  I hadn't thought to search for "cable router", since I imagined that would give me results about hardware intended to be connected to networks such as Virgin media's (as opposed to standard ethernet networks).  Maybe that hardware is typically only bought by the cable providers themselves, though?
13:55  OmNomSequitur: £200 for a router isn't insanely expensive.
13:55  jacekowski: OmNomSequitur: not really
13:55  jacekowski: OmNomSequitur: it's same crap as cheap £30
13:55  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, you have cable internet don't you?
13:55  jjlee: yes
13:55  OmNomSequitur: jacekowski, I had no idea Cisco were selling IOS routers for £30.
13:55  OmNomSequitur: I must buy these.
13:55  jacekowski: cisco routers are expensive crap
13:56  OmNomSequitur: £180 for an 851 isn't expensive.
13:56  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: as I say, that's not relevant since I don't intend to replace the device that connects directly to the ISP's network
13:56  jacekowski: OmNomSequitur: it's a cheap made in china toy
13:56  OmNomSequitur: Someone's a Juniper fan!
13:56  jjlee: the device you most recently linked to appears to be just an ethernet device (which is what I need)
13:57  gongoputch: I like cisco switches tho
13:57  jacekowski: OmNomSequitur: that's true, juniper is so much better
13:57  jjlee: so when the retailer says "cable modem", they're referring to ethernet cable.  I didn't expect that.
13:57  jacekowski: what are you looking for?
13:58  OmNomSequitur: No, a "cable modem" is something else.
13:58  jacekowski: cable modem == DOCSIS
13:58  OmNomSequitur: What I linked to are called "cable routers".
14:01  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: sorry, typo, I meant "cable router"
14:01  OmNomSequitur: They're not referring to ethernet cable.
14:01  jacekowski: it's ussualy same hardware as adsl router
14:02  jacekowski: just different firmware
14:02  OmNomSequitur: They call them "cable routers" to differentiate from "ADSL routers".
14:02  jacekowski: because adsl router have to do pppoe/pppoa as well
14:02  jjlee: OmNomSequitur, who is not referring to ethernet cable
14:02  jacekowski: but some of them can do both
14:02  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, the retailers.
14:02  OmNomSequitur: They mean "cable" as in "cable internet".
14:02  jjlee: OmNomSequitur, this specific one (the one that you linked to) is referring to ethernet cable
14:02  OmNomSequitur: ...
14:03  jjlee: that is what surprised me a bit
14:03  jjlee: so your link was helpful
14:03  OmNomSequitur: The "cable" in "cable router" refers to "cable internet" not "ethernet cable".
14:03  jjlee: OmNomSequitur: looking at the photos of the back of the device, that doesn't appear to be the case
14:04  OmNomSequitur: ...
14:04  jjlee: oddly, the reviews on that page all seem to refer to a wireless router :-/
14:04  OmNomSequitur: YES IT IS A WIRELESS ROUTER
14:04  jjlee: if that's true, it's an interesting choice of name ;-)
14:04  OmNomSequitur: ...
14:04  jjlee: oh, it does say wireless
14:04  jjlee: my mistake :-)
14:05  OmNomSequitur: It's called a cable router because IT ONLY WORKS WITH CABLE INTERNET EG. VIRGIN MEDIA
14:05  OmNomSequitur: It has switch ports and wireless built-in.
14:05  jjlee: ah, now I zoom in on the photo I see a coax connection -- thought that was a power connection
14:06  OmNomSequitur: NO THERE IS NO COAX CONNECTION
14:06  OmNomSequitur: YOU PLUG THE CABLE ROUTER INTO THE CABLE MODEM
14:06  OmNomSequitur: YOU PLUG YOUR PCS INTO THE CABLE ROUTER
14:07  jjlee: hard to tell from the photo
14:07  OmNomSequitur: I JUST TOLD YOU
14:07  jjlee: if that is the case, how does the device have any knowledge of cable ISP networks?
14:07  jjlee: how old are you, by the way?
14:08  Mekkis: jjlee, because the marketeers told it
14:08  jjlee: :-)
14:09  jjlee: surely that thing at the bottom has to be a power connection, since I see no other power connection.
14:10  jjlee: I sure would be helpful if the retailer just said what the thing is intended to do in straightforward technical language.
14:10  ovrflw0x: how can i always get the same static ip address from router? in fedora?
14:10  ovrflw0x: i tried ipv4 manual from NetworkManager
14:10  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, you keep asking ridiculous questions.
14:10  Mekkis: really, it's a NAT device that directed packets from the WAN port to the LAN ports
14:10  jjlee: anyway, it certainly does seem to be a standard router, and nothing to do with ISP cable networks -- so thanks again OmNomSequitur
14:11  blockcold: hi wher i can learn networking ?
14:11  blockcold: i done my ccna but i want more tuts :)
14:12  jjlee: ovrflw0x, what do you mean by static IP address?  If you're talking about a private address range, it depends on the router.  If you're talking about a public IP address, it's up to your ISP
14:13  blockcold: hello need help
14:14  OmNomSequitur: jjlee, I just told you about six times, that it's called a "cable router" because it will work with CABLE INTERNET and not ADSL INTERNET.
14:14  jjlee: blockcold, what do you want to learn about?
14:15  blockcold: jjlee: sir i want to learn about ccns
14:16  OmNomSequitur: You mean CCNA?
14:17  blockcold: OmNomSequitur: i done my CCNa Training but i think i am still weak in networking
14:17  OmNomSequitur: blockcold, do you have your CCNA certificate?
14:17  OmNomSequitur: As in, did you pass the exams and get CCNA accreditation?
14:18  blockcold: OmNomSequitur: no sir i have done training in with packet tracer and real routers
14:18  OmNomSequitur: Ok, so get your CCNA accreditation.
14:19  blockcold: OmNomSequitur: yes
14:19  OmNomSequitur: After that, you can pursue a CCNP, if you want.
14:19  jacekowski: ccna is useless
14:19  OmNomSequitur: But a CCNA is enough for most mid-level jobs.
14:19  jacekowski: ccna is entry level cert
14:19  OmNomSequitur: You need a shitton of experience though.
14:19  jacekowski: and it's very basic entry level
14:19  blockcold: but what i do now ?
14:19  crilly: No, that's the CCENT, jacekowski
14:19  OmNomSequitur: jacekowski, how is CCNA + 3 years' experience not enough for an SME?
14:20  crilly: OmNomSequitur: It's more than enough.
14:20  jacekowski: i'm not going to paste logs from this channel
14:20  OmNomSequitur: He's saying it's not enough.
14:20  OmNomSequitur: And yeah, the CCENT is the entry-level certification.
14:20  jacekowski: but there is a person that knows nothing about networking
14:20  OmNomSequitur: Yes, we all know those people.
14:20  OmNomSequitur: Total dumbass gets a CCNA.
14:20  OmNomSequitur: 'Cos of some boot camp.
14:20  jacekowski: and he still has CCNA
14:20  OmNomSequitur: Yes, I know those people.
14:21  OmNomSequitur: I know a guy who has a CCNA and CCNP
14:21  OmNomSequitur: He doesn't know the difference between full- and half-duplex.
14:21  OmNomSequitur: I mean really.
14:21  OmNomSequitur: He's a total idiot, but he went to some sham course and somehow "passed".
14:21  OmNomSequitur: But this is true of ALL professional accreditations.
14:22  OmNomSequitur: There'll always be people who either cheat, or bribe their way to the qualifications.
14:22  crilly: Hence why experience is more valuable.
14:22  OmNomSequitur: I'd rather take somebody with 5 years' experience and test them in the interview.
14:22  jacekowski: or are just lucky
14:22  OmNomSequitur: (Than somebody with a CCNA and only a year's experience).
14:22  OmNomSequitur: But a qualification is still important.
14:23  OmNomSequitur: I'd rather take CCNA + 3 years than no qual + 4 years.
14:23  OmNomSequitur: But hey, nevermind.
14:23  OmNomSequitur: The problem with no formal qualification is, there'll be stuff you haven't been exposed to in the workplace which is covered in the exams. So, there'll be knowledge gaps.
14:23  crilly: http://www.serversplus.com/servers/tower_servers/hp_tower_servers/612275-421 - This is tempting.
14:24  OmNomSequitur: Eg. next to nobody has IPv6 experience, but it pays to know the theory.
14:24  jacekowski: crilly: i spent more on desktop
14:24  OmNomSequitur: crilly, that looks like a bread bin.
14:24  crilly: lol indeed
14:24  OmNomSequitur: jacekowski: most people spend more on netbooks or smartphones.
14:24  crilly: nice little server though.
14:24  crilly: for only £89.
14:25  OmNomSequitur: A £190 server? lol
14:25  OmNomSequitur: Oh lol Athlon II Neo.
14:25  jacekowski: 1.3GHz
14:25  jacekowski: 1G of ram
14:25  OmNomSequitur: It's a laptop board inside a bread bin case.
14:25  jacekowski: single hdd
14:25  jacekowski: hmm
14:25  OmNomSequitur: That server will be slow as fuck.
14:25  jacekowski: Simple to own and easy to use
14:25  jacekowski: Server performance but at a PC price
14:25  OmNomSequitur: ...
14:26  OmNomSequitur: That "server" will perform worse than 90% of netbooks.
14:26  OmNomSequitur: Its CPU is ridiculously weak.
14:26  jacekowski: hmm, i could buy it for my home stuff
14:26  OmNomSequitur: Just buy a Shuttle, crilly, if you want to save space.
14:26  jacekowski: just how many hdds i can stick in it
14:26  jacekowski: before power supply fails
14:26  OmNomSequitur: They come with proper boards and chipsets.
14:26  jacekowski: OmNomSequitur: but that costs £89
14:27 --- ChanServ sets modes [##networking +v sepski]
14:27  jacekowski: ideal thing to use at home to store my porn
14:27  OmNomSequitur: It's £189.
14:27  OmNomSequitur: Not £89.
14:27  jacekowski: - £100 cashback
14:27  OmNomSequitur: Oh.
14:27  jacekowski: so £89 in total
14:28  OmNomSequitur: It's still a piece of shit.
14:28  OmNomSequitur: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/222816 This is a proper PC in a SFF case.
14:28  OmNomSequitur: £100 barebones.
14:28  OmNomSequitur: You need to buy the CPU and memory.
14:28  OmNomSequitur: But it's a proper PC dammit.
14:29  jacekowski: i don't like ebuyer
14:29  jacekowski: since they fucked me with my laptop warranty
14:29  OmNomSequitur: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/200938
14:29  OmNomSequitur: ^CPU which will give you about 10x the performance of that AMD Athlon II Neo bullshit
14:31  Mekkis: OmNomSequitur, not this kind of SFF PC http://nl.ti4200.info/~mekkis/IMG_1374.JPG
14:31  jacekowski: K125 version of it
14:31  jacekowski: which is 1.7GHz
14:31  jacekowski: has 475 points http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu_lookup.php?cpu=AMD+Athlon+II+Neo+K125
14:32  jacekowski: uuh
14:32  jacekowski: that's slow
14:32  OmNomSequitur: Yes.
14:33  OmNomSequitur: The E5500 has 1,900 points on the same bench.
14:33  OmNomSequitur: It will be more than 4x faster, though.
14:33  OmNomSequitur: If you *REALLY* want to build a small PC, build a micro-ITX rig.
14:33  OmNomSequitur: You can go with an Atom-based board, or an 1156 (core i3, i5, i7) board.
14:33  Mekkis: micro-itx?
14:34  OmNomSequitur: Er
14:34  OmNomSequitur: Mini-ITX.
14:35  Mekkis: you can go a Via instead
14:35  Mekkis: if you don't care about performance
14:36  Punker: Hi there. I dunno if this is the right channel... I'm wondering about private domain registrations... can any corporation look further and finally discover who orders a domain?¿ ... I got asked this question yesterday and didn't know what to say
14:37  Punker: by privacy I mean anonimity
14:37  Punker: anonymity*
14:37  jacekowski: not unless they get a warrant
14:37  jacekowski: or your registrar leaks that data
14:37  jacekowski: but why would you hide your details?
14:39  Punker: well this friend of mine stated a possible situation: case you publish a website against a democratic goverment (1)... I'm not talking about leaking sensitive information of course... in a democracy basis this (1) would be accepted as a way of freedom speech
14:41  Punker: never mind goverment, let's say a corporation or whatever other issue
14:50  AgentCarmichael: I am trying manually trying to pass in a parameter & value in a POST request to a host, through telnet. However, when copy pasting the text I wrote (+ CRLF + param=value), the host acts as if I never pased in any param and gives me a 500/501 internal server error.
14:50  AgentCarmichael: How do I pass in a param in a POST request through telnet?..
14:54  Punker: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/12/15/telnet-REST.html may be interesting
14:59  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: rfc 2616 should explain it in sufficient detail :)
14:59  fabiim: <fabiim> Hi , i'm doing a school work on Automatic network topology discovery algorithms that do not use dependable network functionality (like SNMP or routing tables) from a single source .  I can't find seem to find significant information , most of what i found is based on attempts to map the Internet. Can someone point to some interesting solutions , open source programs or preferably
14:59  AgentCarmichael: For sure lewellyn.

15:00  AgentCarmichael: Not really because our prof said "don't read the rfc, it doesn't encompass what we learn fully enough and is dry explained anyway".
15:00  AgentCarmichael: Ever thought about human sharing rather than boring text reading?
15:00  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: he's correct on the latter point, but everyone doing raw http really NEEDS to read and understand all of 2616. seriously.
15:00  AgentCarmichael: I mean, as if anyone has time to read rfc's.
15:00 * lewellyn has read rfc 2616 many many times
15:00  AgentCarmichael: Business is a busy world, no time to read tons of text.
15:01  AgentCarmichael: We don't do raw http.
15:01 +xand: you would
15:01  AgentCarmichael: We just deploy webapps.
15:01  lewellyn: i've also read every rfc it cross-references :P
15:01  AgentCarmichael: Use IDE, smack it into a .war file.
15:01  lewellyn: then why are you doing http via telnet?
15:01  AgentCarmichael: And done.
15:01  AgentCarmichael: Because that was one of our first exercises.
15:01  AgentCarmichael: And because I'm a nerd and it's not really homeowrk related
15:01  AgentCarmichael: and want to find out for myself. :)
15:01  lewellyn: x	you know it!
15:02  lewellyn: tabfail :(
15:02  AgentCarmichael: Actually I wanted to see if I could force a POST onto a db on the server
15:02  AgentCarmichael: without using a browser
15:02 * lewellyn forgot that it's 6am sunday and therefore system maintenance time
15:02  lewellyn: i guess that means bedtime ;)
15:02  AgentCarmichael: In my case it's 3 pm.
15:02  AgentCarmichael: :))
15:02  AgentCarmichael: Saturday, though.
15:02  AgentCarmichael: Funny how we are a day apart. LOL
15:03  AgentCarmichael: Though I don't see who would need to do raw HTTP.
15:03  AgentCarmichael: Perhaps the guys over at network engineering.
15:03 * AgentCarmichael is with the app devs
15:04  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: yes. and the rfc should give enough hints
15:04  AgentCarmichael: fabiim: I think CISCO has an app called 'packet tracer' or something.
15:04  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: yes. it's late and i've not slept enough. i meant saturday
15:04  AgentCarmichael: Poor lewellyn.
15:04  lewellyn: if you really don't wish to read the rfc, though... http://developers.sun.com/mobility/midp/ttips/HTTPPost/
15:05 --- FieldySnuts is now known as Fieldy
15:05  AgentCarmichael: :)
15:05  lewellyn: it's midp, but gives examples
15:05  lewellyn: the rfc, if read fully, gives all of the pieces to the puzzle ;)
15:05  lewellyn: i figure that you're doing java, so that should be "close enough" to show you what you want :)
15:05  AgentCarmichael: For those who understand "dry, harsh, pale language".
15:06  AgentCarmichael: :p
15:06  AgentCarmichael: Time to read. :)
15:06  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: like this? ;)
15:06  AgentCarmichael: I don't see any pale language around now.
15:06  AgentCarmichael: :p
15:06  lewellyn: Note: The "multipart/form-data" type has been specifically defined for carrying form data suitable for processing via the POST request method, as described in RFC 1867 [15].
15:07  lewellyn: that's rfc 2616 3.7.2's language
15:07  CMI-DOS: HELP!!! i've lost my named.conf can someone give me a copy
15:07  lewellyn: i see two huge hints in that sentence ;)
15:07  CMI-DOS: i need it desperatly
15:07  lewellyn: it's also the third instance of the word "post" in the document
15:10  AgentCarmichael: I see that you are obsessed by computers.
15:10  AgentCarmichael: lol
15:11 --- ChanServ sets modes [##networking +v StevenR]
15:11  lewellyn: i'm a fan of people knowing what the hell happens behind the scenes ;)
15:11  lewellyn: it tends to make for better code
15:12  lewellyn: but for those playing along at home, the huge hints were: "multipart/form-data" and "described in RFC 1867".
15:12  lewellyn: if you got them both right, score 17 points for this round.
15:13  AgentCarmichael: Oh yeah I see.
15:13  AgentCarmichael: And you run Linux, I assume.
15:13  AgentCarmichael: It's strange because, mainstream of the people don't want to know what happens behind the screens.
15:14  AgentCarmichael: All they want is covenience, i.e. big flashy buttons and easy menus. :P
15:14  AgentCarmichael: Every time I mention something technical to someone they either leave or say "boooring".
15:15  lewellyn: SunOS looking-glass 5.10 Generic_137137-09 sun4u sparc SUNW,UltraAX-i2
15:16  lewellyn: but yeah. people want things to just work. funnily enough, it tends to happen better if they know WHAT they're trying to get to work
15:22  AgentCarmichael: or rather, they just call someone to fix it for them. :P
15:29  jjlee: To answer my own earlier puzzlement: in the course of looking at some other routers, I realise that what OnNomSequitur meant by "I just told you about six times, that it's called a "cable router" because it will work with CABLE INTERNET and not ADSL INTERNET." was that these devices (such as the Buffalo WHR-G300NV2 "wireless cable router") support the PPPoE protocol, and do not support connection to ADSL networks.  Neit
15:29  jjlee: her of those features is relevant to my own situation (I use the Virgin media cable ISP), so the WHR-G300NV2 looks OK to me :-)  It is also supported by the DD-WRT open source firmware, which is nice.
15:29  AgentCarmichael: Ah yeah. Cable. HFC :)
15:30  AgentCarmichael: Huh?
15:30  AgentCarmichael: Isn't ADSL PPoE?
15:31  jjlee: dunno, I don't use ADSL
15:31  AgentCarmichael: Lucky dog.
15:31  AgentCarmichael: My router is not supported. :)
15:31  AgentCarmichael: So I get a max of 20 port forwards lol.
15:32  AgentCarmichael: And if you go over the limit, they are forwarded out into oblivion.
15:32  lewellyn: my isp's box is nice and i see no reason to replace its firmware. ;) at least not till they feed me the ipv6 DS-Lite firmware :D
15:32  AgentCarmichael: :)
15:32  lewellyn: i just wish they'd expose the vpn tab over the regular login rather than the one i'm not supposed to know about
15:32  jjlee: You mean that your ISP only allows IP traffic over a limited number of ports, in an attempt to prevent high-traffic peer-to-peer usage?
15:32  jjlee: that sounds annoying
15:33  lewellyn: jjlee: me? hell no. i can even do bgp in it. :)
15:33  jjlee: was talking to AgentCarmichael, sorry
15:33  AgentCarmichael: That reminds me.
15:33  lewellyn: k :)
15:33  AgentCarmichael: I called my ISP: "Hi, I want ports < 1024 to be open"
15:33  ArtyG: Calling your ISP to open ports...weird concept.
15:34  AgentCarmichael: Helpdesk: "Ah ok sir, you'll have to pay 100 more euros a month for that, if you want ports open, it is for professionals; Our home users don't need that"
15:34 * lewellyn has been tempted to route all the internet through his cable modem a la china ;)
15:34  AgentCarmichael: lol
15:34  AgentCarmichael: Yes because I can't open them, they are locked by my ISP.
15:34  jjlee: is that sort of thing common practice amongst ADSL ISPs?
15:34  AgentCarmichael: No. :)
15:34  ArtyG: I used to have DSL and it was just as open (with ports) as my cable connection.
15:34  jjlee: get another ISP ;-?
15:34  ArtyG: I guess AgentCarmichael is in .be land, though.
15:34  AgentCarmichael: lol
15:35  lewellyn: jjlee: it's common for 25 to be blocked, for obvious reasons. some also block 21 and 80 as their terms of service state.
15:35  AgentCarmichael: Most expensive and limited ISP-land.
15:35  AgentCarmichael: Hey is it possible to re-route port 25 to some other port?
15:35  ArtyG: But everyone always says the US is the worstest internets land everrr!!!!oneone!!
15:35  ArtyG: I mean, worst next to Canada.
15:35  AgentCarmichael: Because they have 56k still oneoneone.
15:35  lewellyn: ag	not really.
15:36  lewellyn: yay high load and irssi tabfail
15:36  jjlee: lewellyn, sorry if I'm being dense, but what's the obvious reason for blocking port 25? (smtp, right?)
15:36  AgentCarmichael: ..?
15:36  AgentCarmichael: Block 80?
15:36  lewellyn: jjlee: way too many open relays by default.
15:36  AgentCarmichael: Is that a joke. :)
15:36  AgentCarmichael: Yes SMTP
15:36  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: no. it's common for many isps to have a "no web/ftp servers" clause at least in .us for home users :)
15:36  AgentCarmichael: Some ISP's don't want you to SMTP.
15:36  jjlee: lewellyn, oh.  people with virus-infected Windows machines?
15:36  AgentCarmichael: Which is wonderful when you have to do networking practices for uni. -_-
15:37  lewellyn: jjlee: more like people who can't figure out how to configure their shiny new linux box to write their superkool new web site.
15:37  AgentCarmichael: I heard the funniest thing the other day.
15:37  AgentCarmichael: Some guy said "windows secure? Yeah"
15:38  AgentCarmichael: Linux was built from day one with security in mind.
15:38  AgentCarmichael: Windows was built, ignoring that there would ever be an internet. :p
15:38  lewellyn: i have a business line and had to request 25 open for that very reason. took all of like 30 seconds once i confirmed that i knew wtf i was doing :)
15:38  jjlee: lewellyn, are there really many of those, using distributions that listen on an appropriate IP by default?
15:38  lewellyn: i gave my isp a virtual cookie for that
15:38  lewellyn: jjlee: there are many broken tutorials and people don't read documentation
15:38  jjlee: maybe there are...
15:39 * lewellyn points at AgentCarmichael's refusal to look for the word "POST" in RFC 2616 earlier, as an example. ;)
15:39  jjlee: I would imagine that Windows machines would be a bigger problem for ISPs
15:39  AgentCarmichael: Whoops.
15:39  AgentCarmichael: Ya don't point at me, lad!
15:39  AgentCarmichael: :p
15:39  jjlee: :-)
15:39  AgentCarmichael: I have a birthday party today. :)))
15:39  AgentCarmichael: Later readings.
15:39  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: also, i think your argument RE: linux was flawed. ;)
15:39  AgentCarmichael: It was flawed?
15:40  lewellyn: jjlee: windows machines are a bigger problem as drones, not open relays.
15:40  AgentCarmichael: Zombie machines.
15:40  lewellyn: windows doesn't ship an smtp server on desktops and it's not installed on servers by default :)
15:40  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: the "Linux was built from day one with security in mind."
15:40  AgentCarmichael: Is it not enabled in IIS?
15:40  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: not by default.
15:40  AgentCarmichael: pff :)
15:40  lewellyn: and it doesn't ship as an open relay
15:41  jjlee: lewellyn, No SMTP server by default: Sure, but if you have taken over a Windows machine, you can install what you like, right?
15:41  lewellyn: it actually takes clicking lots of places to make it into a good open relay :)
15:41  lewellyn: jjlee: no point
15:41  lewellyn: at least no point in installing an open relay
15:41  AgentCarmichael: 90% of spam is sent by zombie computers.
15:41  AgentCarmichael: Not good huh. :)
15:41  lewellyn: better to just send mail sent over the high numbered port
15:41  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: a zombie isn't an open relay. different things.
15:42  lewellyn: an open relay is a misconfigured smtp server.
15:42  AgentCarmichael: Well I don't know what open relay is.
15:42  AgentCarmichael: ah
15:42  lewellyn: google://open+relay
15:42  lewellyn: ;)
15:42  AgentCarmichael: Does my browser even know that protocol?
15:42  AgentCarmichael: lol
15:42  AgentCarmichael: Apparently not.
15:42  lewellyn: maybe not, but you should ;)
15:42  AgentCarmichael: For sure.
15:43  jjlee: mail seems to be a mess.  I'm sure there are people out there who know how all this should work, if done right.  So much inertia!
15:44  jjlee: and so many sticking-plasters
15:48  AgentCarmichael: As with all MIME transmissions, CRLF is used as the separator for
15:48  AgentCarmichael:    lines in a POST of the data in multipart/form-data.
15:48  AgentCarmichael: If that's true, then why does my POST with the CRLF not work? :)
15:49  jjlee: AgentCarmichael, what are you POSTing?  pastebin?
15:50  AgentCarmichael: I'll pastebin it.
15:51  jjlee: CRLF is the correct line terminator
15:51  AgentCarmichael: http://pastebin.com/GDCXpSac
15:51  AgentCarmichael: :)
15:51  jjlee: hmm, pastebin might not be good for this, of course.  encode it somehow first?
15:51  AgentCarmichael: What?
15:51  AgentCarmichael: Don't see what you mean.
15:52  AgentCarmichael: I pasted it privately.
15:52  AgentCarmichael: Meaning only you can see it.
15:52  AgentCarmichael: Anything wrong with my POST request?
15:53  Noveh: Hi, I was wondering if someone can recommend a cheap 4-port+ switch.
15:53  jjlee: So when I paste that into emacs I just see LF newlines
15:53  AgentCarmichael: I think maybe I forgot this:
15:53  AgentCarmichael: Content-Length: 27
15:53  AgentCarmichael: 	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
15:53  jjlee: however, that might well be the pastebin mangling what you posted
15:53  AgentCarmichael: emacs what is that again?
15:54  jjlee: was that an emacs/vi joke, or a question?
15:54  AgentCarmichael: A question.
15:54  AgentCarmichael: I am not a linux user.
15:54  AgentCarmichael: I use notepad and all.
15:54  jjlee: oh, sorry
15:55  jjlee: It's just a text editor
15:55  jjlee: Where did the text that you pasted come from?
15:55  AgentCarmichael: Hrmpf.
15:55  AgentCarmichael: I don't know what to specify for Content-Length.
15:55  AgentCarmichael: Came from notepad.
15:57  AgentCarmichael: Gonna try it on my tomcat server again.
15:58  jjlee: AgentCarmichael, sorry, missed beginning of this conversation.  What are you up to?  You're sending HTTP requests by hand in order to diagnose a problem with some HTTP server software that you have set up?
15:59  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: the content length is just what it sounds like. the length of the content you're posting :)
15:59  AgentCarmichael: I am trying to see if I can send an HTTP POST request by hand, through telnet, to my server, to see if I can update any data on it without going through a browser. :)
16:00 * lewellyn wanders
16:00  jjlee: ok
16:00  jjlee: there's a HTML form you're trying to emulate?
16:01  AgentCarmichael: Something like that.
16:01  AgentCarmichael: Trying to emulate submitting something to the 'database'
16:01  AgentCarmichael: change something
16:01  jjlee: are you able to share the text of the HTML form?  or a modified version of it?
16:01  AgentCarmichael: without going through a browser.
16:01  AgentCarmichael: Thought that'd be cool.
16:02  AgentCarmichael: I have way too much code.
16:02  AgentCarmichael: It's Java.
16:02  AgentCarmichael: wait
16:02  jjlee: actually, never mind
16:03  AgentCarmichael: Gaaah.
16:03  jjlee: I see you just have one form parameter.  I assume form element has method="POST"?
16:03  AgentCarmichael: The server is ignoring my text. :)
16:03  AgentCarmichael: Yes.
16:03  AgentCarmichael: But I am not using any HTML pages.
16:03  jjlee: oh, so you received a 200 response, but the server didn't do what you expected?
16:04  AgentCarmichael: I am simply trying to submit something onto a server which is what happens when you click the submit button.
16:04  jjlee: right
16:04  AgentCarmichael: sec
16:04  jjlee: but often, there is an HTML form whose behaviour one is trying to emulate
16:04  AgentCarmichael: http://www.coderanch.com/t/519215/sockets/java/Keep-getting-NullPointerException#2350985
16:04  AgentCarmichael: = better
16:04  AgentCarmichael: That's my post.
16:08  AgentCarmichael: Can't get it to work.
16:08  AgentCarmichael: A simple POST with a simple param=value. :')
16:08  AgentCarmichael: The server's response is always HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error.
16:09  AgentCarmichael: Because the param is never recognized or passed on.
16:12  AgentCarmichael: I think I must pass the param to an HTML form and not to the webapp.
16:12  AgentCarmichael: :)
16:14  jjlee: where is the text of your form?  It should always be fairly easy to debug these things, since if you send the same bytes as the browser does, you will get the same response.
16:15  xingu: there's always wget --post-{data,file}=...
16:16  AgentCarmichael: For those who know how to use wget and read it of course.
16:17  AgentCarmichael: http://pastebin.com/2Y45xegD
16:17  AgentCarmichael: = my HTML.
16:18  AgentCarmichael: My form, that is.
16:18  AgentCarmichael: color is the param.
16:18  AgentCarmichael: To be caught.
16:20  AgentCarmichael: Should be easy to debug but ironically enough I still have not been able to, after 3 days.
16:29  jjlee: I think you're complicating things by using telnet
16:30  jjlee: send it using a java program or similar
16:42  jjlee: AgentCarmichael: having said that, I just tried sending a POST request to a local server (pretty awkward to do, easy to mis-type something), and it worked fine -- no tricky line-ending stuff tripped me up.
16:43  jjlee: and surely windows telnet will correctly send CRLF too
16:43  AgentCarmichael: :(
16:43  jjlee: use dumpcap and wireshark (or tcpdump, or similar)
16:44  AgentCarmichael: Hrmpf.
16:44  jjlee: then you can be sure what you've actually sent, and what your browser actually sent
16:44  AgentCarmichael: Should be possible with telnet only.
16:44  AgentCarmichael: I can also be sure by seeing the reflected change on the app.
16:44  jjlee: it is possible, but arbitrarily difficult if you make a mistake
16:44  AgentCarmichael: Ok. :)
16:44  jjlee: if you give yourself feedback using a network capture tool, you will track down the problem with 100% reliability
16:46  jjlee: oh
16:46  jjlee: just looked at your request again.  Think somebody already pointed out actually -- it's missing content length.  You fixed that?
16:47  AgentCarmichael: Well.
16:47  AgentCarmichael: I specified the content length at a random 2000.
16:47  AgentCarmichael: The server ignores my request. :(
16:47  jjlee: OK.  Don't do that.
16:47  AgentCarmichael: I press 2x enter and just.. bleh.
16:47  AgentCarmichael: nothing happens
16:47  jjlee: "color=dark" has length 10
16:47  jjlee: So Content-Length: 10
16:47  AgentCarmichael: Oh.
16:48  AgentCarmichael: It will mess up if the content-length is not precies?
16:48  AgentCarmichael: precise
16:48  jjlee: try it
16:49  AgentCarmichael: right on
16:49  jjlee: :-)
16:50  AgentCarmichael: 200 OK.
16:50  AgentCarmichael: Ok so that worked.
16:51  AgentCarmichael: However, it just gives me the HTML of the form page.
16:51  AgentCarmichael: I need the resulting output of the actual webapp.
16:51  AgentCarmichael: So I'll try it with SelectBeer.do
16:51  AgentCarmichael: which is the URL that is obtained after clicking submit
16:52  AgentCarmichael: jjlee, you are a lifesaver.
16:52 * AgentCarmichael thanks jjlee a thousand times
16:53  jjlee: np
16:53  AgentCarmichael: The only mistake in all this jitter simply appeared to be the exact Content-Length. :)
16:54  jjlee: as I said, these problems are always easy to track down if you just run a network traffic analyser like dumpcap + wireshark, and compare what the browser sends with what you send
16:54  jjlee: *almost* always, anyway
16:54  AgentCarmichael: Cool. :)
16:56  jjlee: What I'd like to know is why wireshark doesn't start a dumpcap process for you with appropriate privileges (did I miss the right button to click in there somewhere?).  Why do I have to run it by hand?  Seems crazy.
16:57  jjlee: Hmm, perhaps it does, and just using the GUI is entirely equivalent to running dumpcap by hand?
17:09  AgentCarmichael: Perhaps you may run WS as admin.
17:10  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: i think i told you about content length earlier :P
17:10  AgentCarmichael: Didya?
17:10  AgentCarmichael: Well it's fixed now anyway.
17:10  AgentCarmichael: Thanks though.
17:10  lewellyn: 07:02  lewellyn: AgentCarmichael: the content length is just what it sounds like. the length of the content you're posting :)
17:10  AgentCarmichael: Yes you did.
17:10  AgentCarmichael: But you didn't tell me "10".
17:10  AgentCarmichael: :p
17:10  lewellyn: you didn't ask anything more so i didn't offer anything ;)
17:11  lewellyn: i figured that if the statement was vague, you'd ask for clarification *shrug*
17:12  AgentCarmichael: I don't have a particularly high E.Q.
17:12  AgentCarmichael: >>
17:12  AgentCarmichael: Assuming is a bad thing, lewellyn. :P
17:12  lewellyn: well i'm also not going to do your homework for you
17:14  jjlee: OK, I was wrong, they do document a way to make it work sanely: http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/CapturePrivileges#Limiting_capture_permission_to_only_one_group
17:26  gulum: how can i check packet's length? can i just search for \r\n or \0 in the packet data?
17:30  daemonkeeper: That depends on the packet. \r\n for sure won't work for most payloads
17:31  gulum: daemonkeeper, i know double CRLF's are used for HTTP. but how can i verify packet's size - is there a signature that all drivers follow?
17:32  daemonkeeper: You should specify _which_ packets you are referring to. Most protocols in the TCP/IP stack have a well defined header with a length indicator and/or a well specified end byte
17:32  gulum: ok. thought there was something universal. thanks!
17:33  rvsjoen: the basic answer is that once you go higher than layer 4, all bets are off
17:33  wcami: checksum u mean ?
17:34  gulum: wcami, hmm nope. exactly what rvsjoen said
17:34  gulum: thank you guys.
18:33  RingtailedFox: hiya... i seem to be having DNS issues... i've tried using my ISP's DNS servers for my ISP's DSL router, because websites keep pinging out and saying they can't be reached... so i switched to using OpenDNS' servers, with no real change... tried with Google's servers, and again... no change.. why is this>?
18:34  RingtailedFox: i know yahoo.com is still reachable, and downforeveryoneorjustme.com states that my websites are still up (and i can access them via an SSH tunnel to my friend's server in houston, texas)...

18:36 +xand: RingtailedFox: if the connection times out to the site, that is not a DNS problem
18:38  RingtailedFox: you think it's my ISP (Bell Canada)?
18:39 +xand: probably a routing issue somewhere
18:39  RingtailedFox: i did tracert
18:40  RingtailedFox: each hop along bell's network was somewhere between 350 and 850 ms (closer to 850 most of the time)
18:40  RingtailedFox: it found its way to my website's host, iweb.com/iweb.ca, but then timed out within iweb's internal network on the way to my server
18:56  sgfgdf: hello guys, a question about the types of messages sent over the network. i can't understand what is the difference between multicast and broadcast. what i know is that unicast is a message sent to one specific recipient, and that the multicast is a message for all people in some group. can someone explain what is the difference or point me to some resource?
18:59  daemonkeeper: Multicast has some specific receivers only, whereas a broadcast is addressed to everyonn.e
18:59  daemonkeeper: -n
19:01  sgfgdf: daemonkeeper: is the broadcast only for my specific LAN network? i mean i can't send a broadcast message to all the internet?
19:01  daemonkeeper: Yes, exactly. In fact a LAN is a broadcast domain.
19:01  daemonkeeper: It is not carried accross routers or network (e.g. the Internet)
19:01  daemonkeeper: networks
19:02  OmNomSequitur: A LAN isn't a broadcast domain.
19:02  OmNomSequitur: A LAN can contain any number of broadcast domains.
19:03  daemonkeeper: Well, we may discuss the term LAN then
19:03  RingtailedFox: can you stream stuff like shoutcast audio servers on a wireless LAN?
19:03  OmNomSequitur: Of course.
19:04  RingtailedFox: alright.  thought it was impossible
19:04  sgfgdf: daemonkeeper: does the broadcast addresses always finish as x.x.x.255?
19:04  daemonkeeper: No
19:05  daemonkeeper: The broadcast address is determined by the prefix your network uses. As the most common prefix is /24 this equals to an entire subnet where the broadcast address is indeed .255
19:06  daemonkeeper: For 10.10.10.10/28 on the other hand the broadcast address would be 10.10.10.15
19:11  sgfgdf: daemonkeeper: one more question if you allow - is it true that the multicast and broadcast messages are sent only over UDP?
19:12  daemonkeeper: No, it isn't. Just do a ping.
19:13  daemonkeeper: You can also do broadcast ping to a broadcast address and that's obviously not UDP but ICMP.
19:14  daemonkeeper: And of course TCP
19:14  daemonkeeper: And of course TCP is possible too I mean
19:14  sgfgdf: daemonkeeper: okay, but the multicast i guess can not be over TCP, right?
19:16  daemonkeeper: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Multicast-HOWTO.html although it is a bit outdated as it seems
19:17  daemonkeeper: It makes things somewhat complicated, so generally you'd prefer indeed UDP
19:19  sgfgdf: daemonkeeper: thak you very much for your answers!

21:15  nawk: I have a basic networking/internet sharing question I would like to ask.  The house I'm living at has a rj-45 wall outlet in every room and they're all connected to an Intel Express 140T StandAlone Hub down in the basement
21:19  nawk: My ISP provided an integrated SMC router/cable modem combo
21:19  nawk: the SMC router/cable modem combo has four ethernet ports
21:20  nawk: initially, I thought in order to make use of the Intel hub, I *MUST setup a dedicated server that provides the internet sharing
21:21  nawk: but, in the end, all I had to do was
21:21  nawk: connect a ethernet cable from from one of the four ports on the router and into one of the many ports on hub
21:22  mAniAk-_-: well yeah
21:22  CartoonCat: lol
21:22  CartoonCat: nawk: welcom to networking 101
21:22  CartoonCat: +e
21:22  nawk: CartoonCat its actually not a yeah, b/c I'm feeling embarassed.
21:23  CartoonCat: nawk: thats ok
21:23  nawk: CartoonCat can you correct my me please?
21:23  CartoonCat: nawk: whats to correct ?
21:23  nawk: CartoonCat initally I had thought that
21:24  CartoonCat: i have no idea why you thought that other then you lack(ed) the knowlage that you can chain switches together
21:25  CartoonCat: now, the real question is, do you want to be giving net to all the other people in the house?
21:27  nawk: CartoonCat yes, I lacked the concept.  I thought by doing what I did, I would not be able to currently share internet to ppl connected to the hub.  B/c I had thought that a port on the *router would enable (i.e. dhcp would only assign one ip address to) one computer/connected device
21:28  CartoonCat: ah nope.
21:28  CartoonCat: the router will assign ips from a /24, 256 ips, 254 usable
21:28  CartoonCat: at least that is the most common default settings
21:29  nawk: CartoonCat: 'from a /24'?
21:29  CartoonCat: Correct.
21:29  nawk: what does that mean sir?
21:30  CartoonCat: it means the host mask is 255.255.255.0, or, 24 bits
21:34  nawk: CartoonCat: what is a host mask in a sentence or two (I know there's wiki, but reading one will often involving reading 20+ related articles heh)
21:34  nawk: :-)
21:35  CartoonCat: nawk: and it takes that to correctly edumacate you
21:35  CartoonCat: the mask controls how many ips are in a subnet
21:37  xingu: nawk: an address is simply a 32-bit long locator; the mask is applied to it to determine if it's link-local, or, requires a route-table lookup.
21:37  CartoonCat: much better put
21:38  nawk: CartoonCat: 256 ips, 254 usable,  I assume xxx.xxx.xxx.0 and xxx.xxx.xxx.255 are unusable?
21:38 * xingu is constantly surprised that gso/tso engines don't offload arp
21:38  Shambat: can someone direct me to text that explains how moving the routing processor to the interface works? I have a book here that barely mentions that routing tasks are handled by the interface itself in newer routers, but stops there
21:38  CartoonCat: nawk: correct, .0 is the network and .255 is the broadcast
21:40  xingu: Shambat: there's nothing magical about routing, it's just address rewrite deeper into the frame header; modern hardware doesn't have a route-processor per se, it treats routing like the barnacle on the side of (full) address decode it really is.
21:40  CartoonCat: lol
21:42  Shambat: xingu: hm ok, so instead of handing off the task of rewriting the packet, the interface performs the task on the fly?
21:42  xingu: the difference between "what fabric port do I need to start clocking this out on" and "what do I need to substitute the datalink source address field with" is trivial and something you may as well do whilst waiting for godot (the trail to arrive so CRC can be calculated)
21:43  xingu: Shambat: the interface is probably split between phy, mac, rx queue rings, and fabric.
21:43  Shambat: mhm
21:43  xingu: Shambat: once you reach fabric one of the tasks to do is address decode
21:44  xingu: Shambat: ie, firstly, "is this frame addressed to me" - and then the more esoteric functions.
21:46  xingu: if you're going to have local vs nonlocal lookaside you may as well have local vs nonlocal floodset,src-rewrite key, etc.
21:46  nadav: when talking about a custom subnet
21:47  nadav: like this:
21:47  nadav: 192.168.1.64/26
21:47  nadav: it means that the last 6 bits will be opened for hosts, which means 127 addresses
21:47  nadav: but what is the importance of the .64 I got?
21:47  nadav: or I just disregard it?
21:47  nadav: (a theoretical question)
21:47  xingu: a 32bit address space is small enough you can stamp it out several times over in sram these days
21:48  xingu: fortunately you only need 32x4094x4 or so copies of it to do a reasonable job
21:50  xingu: Shambat: there's some pretty pictures over here: http://www.fulcrummicro.com/alta_micro.htm
21:51  mAniAk-_-: nadav: thats a /25
21:52  Shambat: xingu: thanks
21:52  Shambat: xingu: I think you've explained it a bit over my comprehension, but thats ok :)
21:54  nadav: mAniAk-_- thats how the question was presented to me in a test
21:54  nadav: exam*
21:54  nadav: so its unlikely to write it like this? 64/26?
21:54  daemonkeeper: Is here someone from .nl reading this? I'd need one to do me a mtr.  We're getting complaints from .nl customers about non reachable websites. I'd need someone to verify me that, in order to know who to blame.
21:56  mAniAk-_-: nadav: a /26 is 64 addresses, its fine to write it like that
21:56  Shambat: nadav: 1.64 would be the first address
21:56  Shambat: 192.168.1.64
21:56  Shambat: is the first address of the block
21:57  nadav: I see, thanks
22:02  fruitboy: Hey.
22:03  fruitboy: Guys, how is the shortest route between source A to destination B in an internet transaction?
22:03  fruitboy: determined *
22:04  devdvd: fruitboy, sounds like a homework question.  I'd suggest you do a quick google search for bgp metrics
22:04  mAniAk-_-: indeed
22:04  OmNomSequitur: We have consensus.
22:05  OmNomSequitur: The three of us want you to Google this.
22:05  Shambat: :)
22:05  mAniAk-_-: do it nao
22:05  OmNomSequitur: Because we're lazy and it's late.
22:05  nadav: lol :P
22:05  nadav: google google google!
22:05  OmNomSequitur: nadav and Shambat agree.
22:05  daemonkeeper: another hint to look up: policy routing
22:05  OmNomSequitur: That makes 5.
22:05  OmNomSequitur: Six.
22:05  OmNomSequitur: Six people want you to Google it.
22:05  devdvd: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=BGP+Metrics
22:05  fruitboy: It's not homework, devdvd, I assure you.
22:05  fruitboy: I am a student of philosophy.
22:06  mAniAk-_-: have you googled it yet
22:06  fruitboy: I'm just curious.
22:06  fruitboy: Yes, I'm looking into it.
22:06  OmNomSequitur: Which school of philosophy do you study under?
22:06  fruitboy: I'd rather not mention it here.
22:06  devdvd: well playdo wants you to google that :)
22:07  Shambat: I tried reading "The Republic" once ... couldn't finish it
22:07  OmNomSequitur: If a frame has no header, is it a frame?
22:07  Shambat: no
22:07  nadav: why are we here?
22:07  nadav: is there anybody else out therE?
22:07  OmNomSequitur: That was a philosophical question, Shambat.
22:07  OmNomSequitur: If a router's MAC table is empty, do the nodes exist?
22:07  Shambat: ;)
22:08  mAniAk-_-: xD.
22:08  OmNomSequitur: " [fruitboy] I'd rather not mention it here." <-- ah, a follower of Augustine. I understand.
22:09  fruitboy: Why are networking engineers badly dressed most of the time?
22:09  daemonkeeper: And unshaved.
22:09  devdvd: fruitboy, what it comes down to is BGP uses several metrics to determine what path to take bgp literally uses like 13 different things to determine path cost then it will use the link with the lowest cost
22:10  devdvd: in the even that 2 links are the same cost
22:10  devdvd: bgp will load balance
22:10  daemonkeeper: BGP will first of all be about policies.
22:10  fruitboy: Man, I feel so wierd and nerdy.
22:10  fruitboy: I usually engage in my technical interests in private.
22:11  OmNomSequitur: Does that involve you laying out plastic sheeting?
22:11  devdvd: fruitboy, as far as why network engineers dress "poorly" ....thats kind of a pessimist view to take
22:11  OmNomSequitur: Now that just isn't true.
22:12  OmNomSequitur: My jacket is fabulous.
22:12  fruitboy: I suppose you're right, devdvd.
22:12  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy: I wear this in the cold http://www.asos.com/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=1445695
22:12  devdvd: fact of the matter is we dress comfortably for the simple reason that unlike most office workers...we move around alot, we are constantly in tight spaces and climbing up and down ladders and through ceilings
22:12  devdvd: kinda hard to do in a suit
22:12  OmNomSequitur: I've found more often that network *admins* are overweight.
22:13  daemonkeeper: Thank you :p
22:13  OmNomSequitur: The engineers are skinny, more often than not.
22:13  fruitboy: Sure, it would be ridiculous for you to wear high heels and a skirt.
22:13  fruitboy: I agree.
22:13  fruitboy: If you're female, of course.
22:13  OmNomSequitur: I also wear jeans and a hoodie.
22:13  OmNomSequitur: But then, I'm a sysadmin.
22:13  OmNomSequitur: Not a network admin.
22:13  OmNomSequitur: Perhaps this is why I'm not obese.
22:13  fruitboy: Hey, as long as you're not wierd or socially awkward, you're cool with me.
22:13  devdvd: actually, id like to see a hot network engineer in a skirt clibing a ladder over my desk
22:14  OmNomSequitur: Our old network admin was 18 stone.
22:14  OmNomSequitur: That's 114kg.
22:14  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: as an employer, though, the most important criteria for me when hiring someone is social skills.
22:14  OmNomSequitur: 252lbs.
22:14  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, but they also need to be able to fit through the server room door.
22:14  devdvd: OmNomSequitur, you know why network admins weigh more than sysadmins right?
22:14  Buba: lol
22:15  nadav: heh
22:15  nadav: OmNomSequitur did you have prior expirience when you got hired?
22:15  OmNomSequitur: devdvd, because they move around less?
22:15  nadav: this question goes for anybody else here btw :p
22:15  OmNomSequitur: nadav, yes.
22:15  fruitboy: I wonder how the networking equipment on the Starship Enterprise works.
22:15  nadav: aha, what you did before it?
22:15  nadav: I'm working on my MCITP atm
22:15  OmNomSequitur: I got promoted to the post.
22:15  devdvd: naa, its cuz we are more important thus make more money thus eat better
22:15  OmNomSequitur: Internally.
22:15  devdvd: :D
22:15  nadav: aha I see OmNomSequitur
22:15  OmNomSequitur: From 3rd-line analyst.
22:15  fruitboy: Will remenants of the present networking standards survive in many hundreds of years time?
22:15  OmNomSequitur: Well, 1st-2nd-3rd line.
22:15  devdvd: fruitboy, not if we're lucky
22:16  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, no.
22:16  devdvd: although
22:16  devdvd: if rip managed to survive this long
22:16  OmNomSequitur: We'll have Internet2 by the year 2500.
22:16  devdvd: there might be hope
22:16  daemonkeeper: You mean, _if_ we reacg 2500
22:16  OmNomSequitur: RIP has existed for what, 40 years?
22:16  daemonkeeper: reach
22:16  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: I was walking in the street, and a really strange idea hit me.
22:16 --- joeDeuce is now known as notJanno
22:16  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, shoes made out of bananas?
22:16  nadav: whats the acronym of RIP?
22:16  devdvd: Routing Information Protocol
22:16 --- notJanno is now known as joeDeuce
22:16  nadav: I know for sure its something with Routing and Protocol? :P
22:16  nadav: aha
22:16  OmNomSequitur: RIP is its own acronym.
22:17  daemonkeeper: We're in ##networking here, so RIP is for sure the Routing Information Protocol,
22:17  OmNomSequitur: Unless we're talking about the death of Andrew Tenembaum.
22:17  fruitboy: Technological equipment will become so cheap that you will find out alot about where you are just using a pair of glasses.
22:17  OmNomSequitur: ...
22:18  OmNomSequitur: More likely, we'll have chips connected to our optical nerves.
22:18  fruitboy: Just using your spectacles, you can find out your destination.
22:18  OmNomSequitur: And we'll have a real-life HUD.
22:18  OmNomSequitur: With a health bar.
22:18  OmNomSequitur: And clip status.
22:18  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: for soldiers that may be useful.
22:18  daemonkeeper: And Medi-packs around?
22:18  OmNomSequitur: Medi-pack stations would be all over the place.
22:18  fruitboy: I actually like the idea of a HEV suit.
22:18  OmNomSequitur: But you could only use them once unless you leave the area and return.
22:18  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, like the Dead Space suit?
22:19  daemonkeeper: I choose the nuke weapon on the next spawn.
22:19  fruitboy: I suppose I'm not alone playing alot of Half-Life
22:19  OmNomSequitur: Anyway, cybernetics is the future.
22:19  OmNomSequitur: That's why Star Trek is so silly.
22:19  OmNomSequitur: We'll have microscopic computers inside of us which monitor our health, location, etc.
22:20  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: it would make sense to create an artificial brain using memristors.
22:20  OmNomSequitur: It's a shame we won't be around in the year 200,000.
22:20  OmNomSequitur: Imagine what the world will be like.
22:20  daemonkeeper: A dead world, likely.
22:20  OmNomSequitur: Well, we're living dangerously right now.
22:20  OmNomSequitur: We're vulnerable until we colonise other planets and moons.
22:21  OmNomSequitur: We also don't have any defence against asteroids.
22:21  OmNomSequitur: And we could kill ourselves with enough nukes.
22:21  OmNomSequitur: It'll take about 500 years for us to be safe from ourselves, I think.
22:21  OmNomSequitur: But there's always the risk that aliens will eat us after then.
22:21  daemonkeeper: We haven't reached that since what, 40k years?
22:21  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: our clothing?
22:22  OmNomSequitur: It'd be incredibly lucky/unlucky if we were to meet aliens in the next 10,000 years.
22:22  fruitboy: How far is the army in military technology?
22:22  OmNomSequitur: Most likely, human beings will colonise the galaxy over millions of years.
22:22  OmNomSequitur: And those colonies will diverge thanks to evolution.
22:23  OmNomSequitur: And then we'll all be aliens to each other.
22:23  fruitboy: OmNomSequitur: I've always loved the idea of establishing a colony.
22:23  daemonkeeper: As said, I doubt we will reach the year 12010.
22:23  OmNomSequitur: I should send this screenplay.
22:23  OmNomSequitur: Why, daemonkeeper?
22:23  fruitboy: A selective colony, though
22:23  OmNomSequitur: We just have to keep our fingers crossed that we're not terribly unlucky.
22:23  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, just blondes with big juggs?
22:24  fruitboy: No.
22:24  daemonkeeper: We will nuke out ourselves, sooner or later.
22:24  fruitboy: Strict philosophical principles
22:24  OmNomSequitur: We should definitely be able to travel between stars by the year 3000.
22:24  OmNomSequitur: daemonkeeper, we don't have the ability to create a nuclear winter, yet.
22:24  OmNomSequitur: IIRC we need 3x as many nukes as we have now to do that.
22:25  fruitboy: Speaking of a colony consisting of just blondes with big juggs, I read recently read about a colony of Amazonian women that used to live.
22:25  daemonkeeper: Well, no. Now imagine Palin being allied with North Korea in 2012.
22:26  OmNomSequitur: Palin is hot.
22:26  OmNomSequitur: I would destroy her in the metaphorical sense.
22:26  fruitboy: They would travel to mate, if the they bore a son, they would bring the child to the father
22:26  OmNomSequitur: Her and that slutty daughter of hers, Bristol.
22:26  OmNomSequitur: Oh yes.
22:26  fruitboy: Why does everyone pick on Sarah Palin so much?
22:27  OmNomSequitur: I don't pick on her. She's totally fuckable.
22:27  OmNomSequitur: I would romance her.
22:27  fruitboy: Alright, OmNomSequitur, there's something extremely creepy about someone in his room at a computer with the lights off telling people about who they find sexually attractive.
22:27  OmNomSequitur: My lights are on.
22:28  CMI-DOS: i have two servers working together
22:28  OmNomSequitur: Sarah Palin is like the A+ of politicians.
22:28  fruitboy: Alright, let's talk about networking, please.
22:28  OmNomSequitur: CMI-DOS, congrats.
22:28  CMI-DOS: but..
22:28  daemonkeeper: I'd appreciate that OmNomSequitur. Just keep her away from politics by fuck here all day long.
22:28  daemonkeeper: -e
22:28  CMI-DOS: the main one runs dnsmasq
22:28  OmNomSequitur: I doubt I could satisfy Sarah.
22:28  fruitboy: Her politics are a joke?
22:29  CMI-DOS: and the other one runs a basic dns server that works like bind
22:29  daemonkeeper: *harrumph* maybe we should come back to the channel's topic.
22:29  CMI-DOS: i want to know which one i use to point my domains to
22:31  fruitboy: If I am not there to intervene, you people would even discuss computer networking in a bar!
22:32  nawk: Xingu: are subnet mask and host mask (we talked about earlier) the same thing?
22:32  fruitboy: Nevertheless, I admire your knowledge about networking.
22:33  nadav: fruitboy thats a huge assumption to make, based on a superficial relationship in a ##networking channel :-)
22:35  nawk: are subnet mask and host mask (we talked about earlier) the same thing?
22:36  fruitboy: I wasn't being serious, nadav.
22:36  fruitboy: I like this channel.
22:37  daemonkeeper: Just don't mention the OSI model. That's a sacrilege.
22:37  nadav: haha
22:37  fruitboy: I've been wondering something, guys.
22:37  OmNomSequitur: We know.
22:38  nadav: I wash it every day.
22:38  nadav: You wanted to ask how my hair is so smooth I assume?
22:38  daemonkeeper: Sure
22:38  OmNomSequitur: Your back hair, yes.
22:38  fruitboy: Would it be possible to exploit an NIC design flaw to malicious advantage?
22:38  OmNomSequitur: It's like a silverback's.
22:38  OmNomSequitur: Yes, fruitboy.
22:38  nadav: lol
22:38  OmNomSequitur: But we won't tell you how.
22:38  OmNomSequitur: Because you'll probably use it against us.
22:39  nadav: no way i love my intenrets
22:39  OmNomSequitur: We will not teach you the secret of fire, lest you burn us down.
22:39  daemonkeeper: You are either with us or with the terrorists!
22:39  fruitboy: Suppose a group of hackers knew that a certain organisation's systems used Realtek exclusively.
22:39  OmNomSequitur: Realteks don't have any exploitable flaws that I know of.
22:39  daemonkeeper: That organzation can't be serious.
22:39  fruitboy: What brands do?
22:39  daemonkeeper: You know, they use Realtek
22:39  OmNomSequitur: Also, that hypothetical scenario makes no sense.
22:40  daemonkeeper: Perhaps even Netgear switches
22:40  OmNomSequitur: daemonkeeper, for desktops? Absolutely.
22:40  OmNomSequitur: For servers? I doubt you can even get Realtek on server boards...
22:40  OmNomSequitur: Most orgs will have majority Realtek NICs for their desktop install base.
22:40  fruitboy: Intel NICs are recommended for enterprise?
22:40  OmNomSequitur: A few others, such as Marvell.
22:40  OmNomSequitur: Those are rare.
22:40  daemonkeeper: Depends on what you see as server. You know, cheap ISPs just mount desktop towers in their racks
22:41  OmNomSequitur: Ah.
22:41  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, Intel, Broadcom.
22:41  OmNomSequitur: My blades, for instance, come with 2x each.
22:41  fruitboy: On that note, what elements do these NICs have?
22:42  daemonkeeper: First of all TCP offloading
22:42  OmNomSequitur: Air, Water, Fire, and Heavy Earth.
22:42  fruitboy: If I were to look at a block diagram.
22:42  OmNomSequitur: Oh.
22:42  OmNomSequitur: Google "NIC block diagram".
22:42  OmNomSequitur: And then click on the best result.
22:42  OmNomSequitur: Look at the block diagram.
22:42  nawk: hi OmNomSequitur, are subnet mask and host mask (we talked about earlier) the same thing?
22:43  OmNomSequitur: No, nawk.
22:43  OmNomSequitur: The hostmask can be thought of as the reverse of the subnet mask.
22:44  daemonkeeper: fruitboy, why do you care at all? There are much easier ways to intercept maliciously into network traffic than on the lowest level.
22:45  OmNomSequitur: Yes, like hard-wiring yourself into a core router, and trailing the cable out the window to your van.
22:45  OmNomSequitur: You'd have a laptop, obviously.
22:46  fruitboy: I suppose that Netbooks are favourite tools?
22:46  OmNomSequitur: nawk, you need to read up on IP addressing and subnetting.
22:47  OmNomSequitur: fruitboy, they're ideal for network engineers.
22:47  OmNomSequitur: They're suited to CLIs, due to the ridiculously tiny screens.
22:47  fruitboy: Running a small version of Linux?
22:47  OmNomSequitur: Not usually.
22:47  OmNomSequitur: Most netbooks run XP.
22:48  OmNomSequitur: The rest run Xandros (early Eee's IIRC) and Ubuntu.
22:48  fruitboy: Man, I'm a really wierd nerd. I've recently been curious about how chips like the Southbridge work.
22:49  daemonkeeper: Nontheless one can also run Linux on them, even a full featured.
22:49  OmNomSequitur: Have you ever crossed a bridge, fruitboy?
22:49  OmNomSequitur: It's like that, except instead of people, there are electrons.
22:50  fruitboy: Well, the Soutbridge consists of the controllers of the varaious I/O interfaces.
22:51  OmNomSequitur: What about the Eastbridge?
22:51  daemonkeeper: That breaked down 1989
22:52  nadav: HOORAH!
22:52  OmNomSequitur: Reagan did it.
23:04  fruitboy: Guys, what are your thoughts on Nvidia nForce NICs?
23:05  nawk: OmNomSequitur my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and earlier I was told that my host mask is /24 (or 255.255.255.0), they could be the same?
23:08  nadav: OmNomSequitur you build me a network now!
23:12  stakkars: howdy! Is this the channel to ask about "OS X and Windows networking" ?
23:13  Shambat: "If you have a question, just ask it!"
23:14  KindOne: can anyone recommend a good router, we got a xbox 360 on wi-fi, and 4 other computers on ethernet, and a few laptops on wi-fi
23:15  Shambat: KindOne: you want 802.11n or g?
23:15  stakkars: KindOne: Yes, I have a very good recommendation for a router:
23:16  KindOne: g is mandatory, n is optinal, since i dont have any hardware that currently has n
23:16  stakkars: Buffalo NFinity
23:16  Shambat: WRT54GL is nice as you can install dd-wrt/tomato/OpenWRT
23:16  Shambat: has 4 ports + wifig
23:17  Shambat: wfi*
23:17  KindOne: im currently using a Wrt54G v5  with latest firmware
23:17  stakkars: has it all as in the last answer.
23:17  fruitboy: Does 802.11 use QPSK modulation?
23:18  stakkars: plus 802.11n
23:18  stakkars: comes with dd-wrt installed, no need to change it.
23:19  Shambat: stakkars: those are cool
23:20  stakkars: Shambat: yes, I read a lot about WRT54GL and came along the Buffalo afterwards.
23:20  stakkars: a great deal, cost is about 70€ in Germany.
23:20  jacekowski: fruitboy: yes
23:21  stakkars: has 32MB memory, so you can install a lot of extras.
23:21  fruitboy: So, what are you doing for Christmas?
23:21  fruitboy: How would you react if you get a router for a present?
23:22  stakkars: Question about "Windows 7 and OS X samba browsing"
23:22  Shambat: I would like one of those, I have a WRT54GL now, but 802.11n would be nice
23:22  stakkars: fruitboy: say "thanks" and see if it can be used as a repeater
23:23  fruitboy: I would feel wierd.
23:23  Shambat: fruitboy: I think it depends which standard of 802.11 you are asking about. 802.11b uses DSSS and 802.11g uses OFDM
23:25  Shambat: fruitboy: there are also different PSKs in use within the different standards
23:26  fruitboy: Do all routers usually run with an operating system?
23:27 +xand: routers require firmware yes.
23:28  stakkars: unfortunately many run just something different from Linux.
23:29  stakkars: about Win7/OSX integration:
23:29  stakkars: did someone manage to get network browsing to work with Win7 clients?
23:30  stakkars: I got that, but it might be improved...
