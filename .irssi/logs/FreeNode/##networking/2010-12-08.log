02:48  bonhoffer: i just got an asus rt-n12 -- my first computer connected fine -- but i can't get an ip from others
02:48  bonhoffer: i am using wpa2-personal . . . with aes  -- my subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
02:49  bonhoffer: my first computer has an ip of 192.168.1.4 -- which makes sense
02:49  bonhoffer: if i connect with my other computer, i can select the ssid, get authentication, but then get an ip of 169.254.89.214
02:49  bonhoffer: is that even in my net-mask?

03:08  reventon_: lets say i have an application that transmits information on 5 different ports, but i'm behind a firewall that's blocking those ports and i don't have admin access to the firewall. i do however have another server of mine outside the firewall
03:08  reventon_: is there a way to tunnel the traffic of those 5 ports through my server? without opening 5 instances of ssh

03:10  msbhvn: reventon_: 1 ssh session with 5 port forwards?
03:11  reventon_: obvious solution, i know, but i can't seem to be able to build the command correctly
