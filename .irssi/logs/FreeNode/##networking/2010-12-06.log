00:38  jawnah: anyone have any experience with mesh VPN networks?
00:39  JSM87: Hi guys, im after buying some rj45 wall sockets to create a network in my office (searching on ebay). I cant seem to find many faceplates that come combined with the 'keystones'. is it normal to have to buy these seperate... if so, are there different types or is it a case of one size fits all
00:42  albatrons: hi
00:45  xous: JSM87: I haven't done many installs (mostly home stuff) but I think they will all fit
00:48  mrrothh: oh
00:48  xous: What's a good way to keep an eye out for IP conflicts?
00:48  albatrons: shut up
00:52  OmNomSequitur: xous: easiest way is to ensure your DHCP scopes don't overlap...
00:53  xous: OmNomSequitur: staticly assigned.
00:53  albatrons: did you fart
00:53  xous: yeah. we can't trust our own techs to ping shit before assigning it.
00:54  xous: Working on moving critical services into their own Vlans and segregating dedicated servers.
00:54  OmNomSequitur: xous: ...
00:54  OmNomSequitur: Jesus fucking Christ.
00:54  OmNomSequitur: You have people who can't even tell if they're causing IP conflicts
00:54  OmNomSequitur: And you allow them to choose IPs?
00:55  OmNomSequitur: You don't even need to do any of that shit.
00:55  OmNomSequitur: Just have a proper procedure in place.
00:55  xous: OmNomSequitur: I have people I can't trust to set a proper netmask
00:55  OmNomSequitur: Why on earth do techs need to assign static IPs in the first place?
00:55  OmNomSequitur: This is insane.
00:55  Harold_parker: bet they all got their ccna's too
00:55  Harold_parker: LOL
00:55  Harold_parker: certs are such a joke
00:55  xous: OmNomSequitur: We don't have enough compentent techs to provide 24/7 coverage.
00:55  OmNomSequitur: CCNPs, more like.
00:56  OmNomSequitur: Ok, xous, so fucking educate these idiots.
00:56  OmNomSequitur: They don't need to ping anything.
00:56  Harold_parker: god help us
00:56  xous: I've tried.
00:56  OmNomSequitur: Their job is to reference the IP addressing scheme database.
00:56  mrrothh: http://213.251.145.96/mass-mirror.html
00:56  xous: OmNomSequitur: ha. the IP database is a WTF.
00:56  OmNomSequitur: They look for a spare IP, and they assign it to that node.
00:56  xous: it can't be trusted.
00:56  OmNomSequitur: ...
00:56  OmNomSequitur: Well, there's your problem.
00:57  OmNomSequitur: Assigning static IPs is a two-step process.
00:57  OmNomSequitur: 1) Find an unallocated IP in your addressing scheme document
00:57  OmNomSequitur: 2) ping that IP
00:57  xous: Well, I can't trust them to add IPs to the database properly. I can't trust 'em to ping them.
00:57  OmNomSequitur: ...
00:57  xous: so now I can't trust the DB>
00:57  OmNomSequitur: Well then, you're fucked.
00:57  OmNomSequitur: Fire the lot of them.
00:57  OmNomSequitur: We have fine IP address gurus in here in need of jobs.
00:58  xous: I doubt they'd take what we pay.
00:58  OmNomSequitur: This is why I'm grateful I work in a place where I get to decide how much access other people get.
00:58  OmNomSequitur: I'm always left disappointed when I try to help other people.
00:58  OmNomSequitur: I teach them something, and they use that knowledge to do something stupid.
00:58  OmNomSequitur: Eg. the other day I taught someone how to enable and disable images in WDS.
00:58  xous: OmNomSequitur: I'm working on getting the thing sane.
00:59  OmNomSequitur: A simple 10-second task.
00:59  OmNomSequitur: So some tech disables all of the useful ones.
00:59  xous: haha
00:59  OmNomSequitur: Network admin annoyed, me annoyed.
00:59  OmNomSequitur: Last time I help that idiot.
00:59  xous: OmNomSequitur: I've been asked how to set the date in linux.

When the ADSL modem (in bridge modem, no NAT) is connected to a Linux Server and the Linux Server shares the connection with a workstation all pages on the Internet load correctly, execpt for "Facebook Photos", any pages that come from "sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net" intermittantly fail to load, however on

02:46  arosen1: Hello, i'm trying to figure out where i can actually see vlan tagging. Where in the packet would this go?
02:46  arosen1: (Which layer)
02:46  deadalnix: 2
02:47  deadalnix: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q
02:49  arosen1: deadalnix: so the switch will actually shift the data down in the packet to add that in?
02:49  deadalnix: depends on your configuration
02:50  deadalnix: I have to go to sleep sorry
02:50  deadalnix: 3 in the morning her
02:50  arosen1: thanks that help though
02:50  arosen1: night!
02:50  deadalnix: thx
02:54  chad: arosen1: yes the tag is added to each packet's ethernet frame

03:49  jawnah: hi
03:50  dann: when i read badwidth limit 2bps limit... this means i can download file at max 2MB/s?
03:50  dann: or it means my internet connection is only 2MB/s?
03:50  dann: 2Mbps*
03:51  jawnah: 2bps?
03:51  dann: 2Mbps*
03:51  jawnah: oh
03:51  jawnah: typically that means your download speed
03:51  dann: that is preety high right?
03:51  jawnah: so, you could download a file at 2Mbps (megabit)
03:52  dann: i've never downloaded that fast even from micrsoft website
03:52  jawnah: it's not Megabyte like you're thinking with the capital B
03:52  jawnah: you would need to divide by 8
03:52  dann: ahhh
03:52  jawnah: so that's 256KBps
03:52  jawnah: you should be able to download, at max, 256 kilobytes per second
03:52  dann: so your saying my max download speed is 256?
03:52  jawnah: should be.
03:52  dann: 2Mbps transfer limit
03:53  dann: thats not very high
03:53  jawnah: 2Mbps download speed... your upload is usually much less
03:53  dann: yea i mean download speed
03:53  jawnah: it's not extremely high, you're right.
03:53  dann: i thought with that (if i could max it out) i could download 100MB movie in 100/2 seconds
03:53  dann: 50 seconds
03:53  jawnah: no
03:54  jawnah: ;/
03:54  dann: thats rediculously low
03:54  dann: 256
03:54  dann: meh
03:54  jawnah: sorry ?
03:54  jawnah: ;/
03:55  dann: i just think its lo
03:55  dann: low
03:55  dann: i can download much faster than that
03:56  jawnah: perhaps it's not an accurate figure then
03:56  dann: its just weird
03:56  jawnah: what sort of speed are you getting?
03:56  dann: cuz what i am talking about is renting a vps in tokyo
03:56  dann: you'd think they wouldn't limit you to 256KB/s download speed there
03:56  dann: since they have fastest internet in world
03:58  jawnah: heh.
03:58  jawnah: why not get a VPS in the united states?
03:59  dann: well im moving to mainland China, i want vpn connection to a vps so i can actually use the internet freely
03:59  dann: i think japan is close enough for low latency
03:59  dann: USA would probably be meh performance

04:13  jawnah: upload, yeah... that's healthy.
04:13  jawnah: wait
04:13  jawnah: wth
04:13  jawnah: it's not 73Mbps
04:13  mrrothh: oh itis
04:14  jawnah: is it?

04:16  jawnah: I do
04:16  jawnah: I'm totally doing the math all wrong.
04:16  mrrothh: oh
04:16  jawnah: wait... if you're doing 9 gigs per hour
04:17  jawnah: you have to be sending at a rate of 153MBps
04:17  mrrothh: thatwhat the bandwith meter said
04:17  jawnah: no
04:17  jawnah: nono
04:17  jawnah: you're right

04:17  jawnah: I wasn't dividing an extra 60 in there.
04:17  jawnah: ;)
04:17  mrrothh: becuase my client was not happy
04:17  mrrothh: he like 9 gigs an hour is slow
04:17  mrrothh: when full backup is 100 gigs
04:17  mrrothh: 120 gigs
04:18  mrrothh: I told him, the rest of the backups are diff and incs
04:18  mrrothh: 2 gigs at most
04:18  jawnah: what os is it from?
04:18  mrrothh: windows 2003 server to a filezile ftp server on a wind2003server
04:19  mrrothh: it is acronis backups
04:19  jawnah: ah, ok

04:19  jawnah: you know that Microsoft has an imaging "backup" system?
04:19  mrrothh: and remove the oldest one
04:19  mrrothh: for windows 2003
04:19  jawnah: it's not technically for "anything" I don't really think... the ImageX utility is what I'm referring to

05:45  Xenofon: that loaded
05:45  Xenofon: does it mean that my dns server is down?

05:55  cmnky: only difference i see ... is that traceroute is root, tracepath is unpriviledged
05:55  Xenofon: anyone know how to set the DNS server in Windows 7?
05:56  breadcrumb: right click on your network adapter, click properties, then IPv4, then specify it manually there

Not quite -- this time it's Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois and and Indiana feeling the pain of no Comcast internet, according to a bevy of tipsters and a series of official ComcastCares tweets. As before, the fix is fairly simple, assuming you know how to manually switch your DNS -- just point your computer to a public domain name server (like Google's at 8.8.8.8
07:12  mrrothh: and 8.8.4.4, but there are plenty of others) and things should re-route themselves in seconds flat. wow why

11:56  lupine_85: FabTG, sure, if you have the hardware to support it
11:56  lupine_85: you could run ATM to all your machines if you really wanted to
11:56  lupine_85: ethernet's kind of standard, though
12:00  FabTG: lupine_85: thx for your answer! just for my information, where do i say to my hardware to use this protocol or another one?
12:00  lupine_85: you go to the hardware store and buy new hardware
12:01  FabTG: lupine_85: let's suppose that my hardware suppose both
12:01  FabTG: support both pardon
12:01  lupine_85: it doesn't
12:01  FabTG: this is hard designed ?
12:02  lupine_85: *blink*
12:02  lupine_85: it's layers 1 & 2. what do you think?
12:02  FabTG: Ethernet is layer 2 , isn't it so not really physical?
12:03  asig: good morning; i'm sorry for reanswer... about which protocol do you speak? tnx
12:03  lupine_85: 'It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model as well as a common addressing format and Media Access Control at the Data Link Layer.'

12:04  FabTG: lupine_85: i have to read a little more ;)
12:04  asig: FabTG: is your NIC tocken ring?

13:09 +sep: smik, use a web redirect on some online webserver (many doman name registrars provide such a service) from http://www.domain.com to http://ip(or some name):23

14:20  slavka`: ok... well i know the basics abound the hand shake thing for ssl
14:20  slavka`: but how much is in each packet?
14:20  ScottG: I'm doing some homework using wireshark. I just visited this page with some text and two images while wireshark was running. I'm asked this:
14:20  doublehp: slavka`: with HTTPS, only the server name is public, to make the frames go to the right machine
14:20  slavka`: like does my password get broken down  into packets
14:20  ScottG: Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.
14:20  slavka`: and if so how many packets?
14:20  doublehp: slavka`: even the URL, the requested page is encpasultaed inside the SSL tunnel
14:21  ScottG: I don't know what it means by "seially" or "parallel"
14:21  ScottG: serially*
14:21  doublehp: slavka`: host name (( SSL link (( URL (( private data
14:21  slavka`: ahh cool... so it gets passed from router to router yet content is encripted
14:21  ScottG: Well, I am guessing it means it waits for the other to finish or they both happen at the same time. However, I don't know how to use wireshark to check for that
14:22  doublehp: slavka`: even your  modem does not know the URL
14:22  slavka`: how much pay load in each packet?
14:22  slavka`: if anyone knows?

14:53  praba:  hi ,  I have configured DNS servers behind NAT.. my nameserver returns router ip instead of actual zone ip
14:56  doublehp: too ba for you
15:01 +sep: praba, check if the reply is different inside and outside NAT perhaps it's your router's nat trying to be clever.

15:59  doublehp: i'd have  put 2.0.0.10 ...

16:15  needsomehelp: each one is a seperate file
16:15  xingu: needsomehelp: the first is designed to be pulled into named.conf (eventually) via include directive
16:16  xingu: needsomehelp: my guess is that you're trying to load the first file as an actual zone
16:16  needsomehelp: what makes you say that?
16:16  xingu: the error messages bind is spitting out
16:17  needsomehelp: perhaps i should include /var/named/master/ in named.conf?

18:22  icekk: If I have a lan and want two devices to be able to communicate with each other while they do not know each others IP address, is there a way I can do this? Like some broadcasting protocol or something else?
18:29  ka1ser: In theory, you could do fine with mac address... in practice... most applications run on top of tcp/ip, so you would be requiring ip address for that... if you want to discover clients on the network, 'nmap' app does a good job for that
18:29  Yancho: hi. is it against the RFC to have a CNAME pointing to another CNAME which is a round robin
18:31  mrjester: There are likely better solutions than running nmap to determine the IP of another system.  dhcp dns updates come to mind as being the 'normal' way of doing it.
18:31  icekk: mrjester, this is interesting, you are saying a system can tell its dhcp server hello, place this dns entry in your tables for my ip?
18:32  mrjester: icekk: yes.  That is normal.
18:32  icekk: so when the other guys tries to talk to him they can know it will be named "device1"
18:32  Yancho: im trying to set up a cname against verify.azure.com which looks like a round robin
18:32  icekk: That would assume that the other device knows the other devices names right
18:32  icekk: but that could be defined prior?
18:32  icekk: defined, statically.
18:32  mrjester: icekk: yes.
18:33  icekk: mrjester, lets say you didnt have a dhcp server, you were just using static ips.... if you had static ips, you wouldnt need a dhcp server right...and lets say u arent the one setting the static ips so you dont know priorhand, is there another way in that case?
18:33  mrjester: icekk: dnsmasq is a simple DNS/DHCP server.
18:34  icekk: mrjester, but what if the lan has like multiple subnetworks like vlans i believe or whatever....
18:34  icekk: that would cause problems right?
18:34  icekk: i mean arent there a lot of topologies ofland networks where dhcp wont work for all devices
18:34  mrjester: icekk: you are describing one of the basic use cases for DNS.  But, if you don't have DNS or don't know the client name, then something like nmap becomes necessary.
18:35  icekk: where nmap scans all the range of ips or something?
18:35  mrjester: I have multiple vlans being services by the same dhcp and dns server.
18:35  ka1ser: vlans has nothing to do with the problem
18:35  mrjester: icekk: correct re: nmap
18:35  ka1ser: have*
18:36  ka1ser: yes nmap scans the whole range of ips
18:36  icekk: When I get an ip from my dhcp, does it do a dns entry for my computers name automatically?
18:36  mrjester: Realy depends on the dhcp server.  Some consumer devices do.
18:36  icekk: and Is there a way I can just have the device send out some broadcast that says "HI any device that can hear me, please tell me ur ip address" and have all the other devices listen and respond...would that work?
18:37  mrjester: IIRC bonjour does that.
18:37  icekk: so would like a udp broadcast packet be able to get routed through to all the devices regardless of lan network topology/
18:38  mrjester: Dunno if bonjour will cross broadcast domains.  I would assume not.
18:39  icekk: which is why you'd use dns, becaues all devices can always ask the dns
18:40  mrjester: Everything already works with dns.  No reason to reinvent the wheel.
18:40  icekk: what if i have x number of devices and i want each of them to be able to find out all the others ip address.... is there a way i can just name all the devices the same and when i do a dns lookup it just returns back the range of ips that are all those devices?
18:40  icekk: like device X wants to know the ip of device y,z,a,... where it doesnt know how many other devices there are
18:41  mrjester: If you know the hostname, then just do a look up.
18:41  icekk: but can i give a hostname of "Device" to every single device. I mean what will happen when I try to do a dns lookup on "Device" when there are 5 devices with a hostname of "Device"
18:41  mrjester: If they are all windows devices, there is already the netbios stuff going on.
18:42  mrjester: icekk: why don't you clearly layout hte problem you are trying to solve instead of posing whatif questions.  You are likely to get a better answer.
18:48  icekk: I am just saying, lets say we have a hotel where there  are N number of devices (linux based embedded devices) that all control electrical utilities in each room, there are approximately 30 rooms per device, and each of the devices need to be able to talk to each other, but since each hotel is different, they just need to be able to drop into place, start up and get an ip and then be able to talk to all the other devices, to run so
18:48  icekk: mrjester.
18:48  CMI-DOS|Term: what is the default port for tcpd
18:49  mrjester: icekk: in scenarios like that, I think multicast is probably the best solution.
18:50  mrjester: icekk: All of the devices join the MC group and they can all communicate easily.
18:50  icekk: MC?
18:50  icekk: there is a multicast group?
18:50  icekk: how does that work exactly
18:50  mrjester: multicast
18:50  mrjester: google will help you answer that question.
18:50  mrjester: devices have to support it as well.
18:50  icekk: oh
18:51  mrjester: If you have a bunch of devices that are designed to talk to discover and talk to each other, then they should already have a mechanism to do so.
18:51  mrjester: err. designed to discover and talk to each toerh.
18:51  icekk: but multicast packets will be able to reach them? and when you use multicast dont you have to specify addresses/
18:52  ka1ser: icekk, thats why network IT people is needed
18:52  ka1ser: you need someone to design the network
18:53  icekk: Which network? All hotels would be different
18:53  icekk: you cant expect them to just change their whole network lol
18:53  ka1ser: if you want to send to everyone just do a broadcast or multicast as mrjester suggests
18:53  ka1ser: brb
18:53  mrjester: your device should  accomodate
18:53  ka1ser: going for lunch
18:54  icekk: all im saying is in multicast dont u have to specify an address and if so how do you get it.

RFC2131 says "... the DHCPREQUEST message MUST use the same value in the DHCP message header's 'secs' field and be sent to the same IP broadcast address as the original DHCPDISCOVER message.". But somewhere else it says "Filled in by client, seconds elapsed since client began address acquisition or renewal process".
21:49  ambro718: Seeing that the process begins with DHCPDISCOVER, the secs field inside it is 0. So according to the first statement, the secs field in DHCPREQUEST is also zero.
21:49  ambro718: But in practice, I'm seeing dhcpcd setting 'secs' to the actual number of seconds (1).

22:13  sarthor: i have webserver on 192.168.1.253, how can i redirect the lan machine to internet. there is linux router connected to this lan webserver, the ip os linux is 192.168.1.254
22:14  sarthor: of linux*
22:14  mAniAk-_-: huh
22:14 +xand: huh indeed.
22:15  mAniAk-_-: every time i read something here i loose braincells
22:15  daemonkeeper: I guess he wants a port forwarding. Otherwise: <xand> huh indeed.
22:16  doublehp: is there a way to probe all IPs and all MACs on the network ?
22:17  sarthor: daemonkeeper, i want to forward port 80 to some lan host
22:17  doublehp: in less than 5mn
22:17  doublehp: i meant, v4
22:17  daemonkeeper: doublehp: Ping scan in nmap
22:17  doublehp: some broadcast
22:17  mAniAk-_-: ping -b 192.168.0.0
22:18  daemonkeeper: That is if anything the network mask, not the broadcast.
22:19  doublehp:  ping -b 192.168.0.0 # does not work
22:20  daemonkeeper: sarthor: Google Linux port forwarding. There are plenty of tutorials for that.
22:20  mAniAk-_-: doublehp: in linux

23:12  daemonkeeper: If the Netgear has a web interface, consider looking at it. Otherweise determine it from a client, or override the Linux box' default gateway with a static route to an external website returning your IP (e.g. http://tnx.nl/ip)
23:13 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 167 seconds
23:17  sarthor: daemonkeeper, this linux computer is running in some Internet cafe, so i can not change the gateway for linux computer, because that place is faraway from me, and i can not take any risk, i do not want to loose access to that machine, as i am not an expert
23:18  daemonkeeper: You well need at least shell access to the netgear if your ui doesn't show up anything. Or of a client.
23:20  sarthor: i have only access to Linux machine, and also to 3com web interface,
23:20  daemonkeeper: Which is were?
23:20  daemonkeeper: where
23:21  sarthor: all are in one room, and connected as i shown in the image,
23:21  daemonkeeper: You didn't mention it in your toplogy.
23:21  sarthor: 192.168.0.1 is 3com
23:22  sarthor: modem
23:22  daemonkeeper: That doesn't help you
23:23  daemonkeeper: You can forget everything on the left side of your switch until you want to override some routes.
23:23  sarthor: I think there is a chance, but as i told you, i am not expert, if we redirect 8080 port to linux machine, and then from the linux machine redirect to netgear IP, so will it not work?
23:23  proprietarysucks: hi, what are you trying to do?
23:23  daemonkeeper: Find out the WAN IP of the Netgear uplink router.
23:24  sarthor: proprietarysucks, check here the image , http://www.4shared.com/photo/rRPNyFGV/network.html
23:24  proprietarysucks: and you are on what machine
23:24  daemonkeeper: Linux
23:24  proprietarysucks: clients?
23:24  proprietarysucks: oh
23:24  sarthor: probonono, i am remotely in that linux machine
23:24  proprietarysucks: and your gaateway is 0.1 ?
23:24  daemonkeeper: And he doesn't want to set static routes overriding the Linux default gateway, yes.
23:24  sarthor: probonono, yes,
23:25  sarthor: proprietarysucks, yes
23:25  proprietarysucks: will it act as your gateway if you set it?
23:25  daemonkeeper: [23:17] <sarthor> daemonkeeper, this linux computer is running in some Internet cafe, so i can not change the gateway for linux computer, because that place is faraway from me, and i can not take any risk, i do not want to loose access to that machine, as i am not an expert
23:25  proprietarysucks: _would it_
23:25  proprietarysucks: if you could do that would it work
23:26  proprietarysucks: aka, is anything stopping you from doing that physically
23:26  sarthor: yes, i know to change the route  and make the default the netgear modem, then i can get the ip by wheatismyip or other tool , but i am far away, and i am not expert
23:26  proprietarysucks: ok
23:26  sarthor: so i can not take any risk.
23:26  proprietarysucks: this is what I would do then
23:27  daemonkeeper: I would override the default route just for a single network, e.g. http://tnx.nl/ip as suggested, that minimzes the risk
23:27  rty: hi there
23:27  proprietarysucks: add a static route for 98.207.226.113 to go through 1.253
23:28  daemonkeeper: Exactly
23:28  proprietarysucks: then curl that from your linux machine
23:28  daemonkeeper: (Assuming that IP would help - don't know)
23:28  sarthor: proprietarysucks, that static route for the single host is the solution, i think but I never did that, nor i know about that, so if you tell me how to do that, i will follow
23:29  daemonkeeper: route add -host 98.207.226.113/32 gw 192.168.1.253
23:29  proprietarysucks: user@linuxbox~# ip route add 98.207.226.113 via 192.168.1.253
23:29  proprietarysucks: that will not be permanent, you will need to add a permanent route if you want that
23:30  sarthor: i did that, Now?
23:30  proprietarysucks: on rhel/centos/fedora/etc you'll make a /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0 file that contains only the text:
23:30  proprietarysucks: 98.207.226.113 via 192.168.1.253
23:30  proprietarysucks: sarthor: ip route list
23:30  proprietarysucks: should show it
23:30  daemonkeeper: Then wget/curl 98.207.226.113
23:30  proprietarysucks: trace it first to make sure it works
23:30  proprietarysucks: traceroute 98.207.226.113
23:31  proprietarysucks: and if that shows you stopping at 1.253 then curl 98.207.226.113 should show you your ext ip on that box
23:31  proprietarysucks: none of these actions should interfere in anyone's ability to use your linux box
23:32  sarthor: wget 98.207.226.113
23:32  sarthor: --2010-12-07 01:33:34--  http://98.207.226.113/
23:32  sarthor: Connecting to 98.207.226.173:80...
23:32  rty: i m newbie, i got 5 domain name, my server is running on ubuntu assuming each domain name got an ip, what i have to install, to able to display different domain name display different web page ?
23:32  proprietarysucks: what did traceroute show you
23:33  rvsjoen: rty: you need to set up virtual hosts
23:33  proprietarysucks: rty: you just need to change your apache configuration file to have ServerAlias my-other-host-name for example
23:33  proprietarysucks:  /join #httpd
23:33  daemonkeeper: No need to get an IP for every domain though.
23:34  rvsjoen: read http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/ip-based.html
23:34  daemonkeeper: ... or name based to let them share a single IP
23:34  sarthor: ip route list
23:34  sarthor: 98.207.226.113 via 192.168.1.253 dev eth0
23:34  sarthor: 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.254
23:34  sarthor: 192.168.0.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.0.2
23:34  sarthor: default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth1  metric 100
23:35  sarthor: there is traceroute6, not traceroute
23:35  daemonkeeper: Install it, or mtr(-tiny)
23:35  proprietarysucks: what distribution are you on
23:35  sarthor: ubuntu 9.10
23:35  rty: how to declare in apache configuration file " that i own that domain name " i mean is there any purchase authentification ?
23:35  proprietarysucks: apt-get install traceroute
23:36  proprietarysucks: try that
23:36  proprietarysucks: rty: your server can answer to anything you want it to
23:36  daemonkeeper: rty: No need for that, if you do use IP based virtual hosts.
23:36  daemonkeeper: rty: For name based virtual hosts, Apache has a ServerName directive
23:36  proprietarysucks: rty: however if you want other random people in the world to reach your server by calling that name you need to have a DNS server or pay to use someone else's
23:38  daemonkeeper: rty: For clarification, Apache itself doesn't care whether it should take care of $yourdomain or microsoft.com or google.com. You can, it won't work - unless DNS routes traffic to your IP.
23:39  daemonkeeper: So it does, whatever you instruct it to do
23:42  rty: ok thanks a lot
23:42  sarthor: daemonkeeper, proprietarysucks tracepath and traceroute shows nothing, only 192.168.1.253, and then a lot of * * *
23:44  daemonkeeper: Thats enough
23:44  daemonkeeper: You know the first hop is 192.168.1.253
23:44  daemonkeeper: That's all we wanted to know
23:44  sarthor: daemonkeeper, yes
23:45  proprietarysucks: so what does curl 98.207.226.113 tell you
23:45  sarthor: curl 98.207.226.113 says nothing for long time,
23:45  proprietarysucks: can you ping 98.207.226.113
23:46  sarthor: no reply for ping
23:46  proprietarysucks: so that goes back to my original question
23:46  proprietarysucks: of if putting that as your gateway WOULD EVEN WORK AT ALL
23:46  proprietarysucks: which it turns out the answer is no
23:47  proprietarysucks: something has policies on it, most likely
23:47  sarthor: who is this 98.207.226.113? if this is whatismyip.com, so this site is blocked here
23:47  proprietarysucks: it's whatismyip.org
23:48  daemonkeeper: Then do the same again for 193.200.132.187
23:48  daemonkeeper: (tnx.nl)
23:48  daemonkeeper: Then curl http://tnx.nl/ip
23:50  sarthor: no success
23:51  sarthor: while http://tnx.nl/ip is not banned here.
23:51  abstract3d: hi. i want to use google apps for my domain. create a blog etc. the way to go is also have a vps to host blog etc, so my setup will be
23:51  sarthor: curl / tracepath / traceroute is not working
23:51  proprietarysucks: right, that box doesn't want to be your gateway
23:51  daemonkeeper: You set the route right?
23:51  proprietarysucks: what tells you that it would work as your gateway?
23:51  daemonkeeper: Otherwise proprietarysucks is right
23:51  abstract3d: 1. buy domain  2. register google apps  3. buy vps from linode  3. build wordpress and i will be ready
23:51  abstract3d: right?
23:52  sarthor: daemonkeeper, yes, i did 193.200.132.187 this time
23:52  proprietarysucks: abstract3d: host from home =]
23:52  proprietarysucks: until you actually get some traffic
23:52  sarthor: ip ro sh
23:52  sarthor: 193.200.132.187 via 192.168.1.253 dev eth0
23:52  sarthor: 98.207.226.113 via 192.168.1.253 dev eth0
23:52  proprietarysucks: no point in getting a vm until people actually show some interest in what you ate that day or whatever
23:53  daemonkeeper: I'm really curious, why people do think, they would need a VPS. They could safe a lot of both, money and time by getting some managed web space.
23:53  daemonkeeper: Not that Wordpress for 6 users a day woul require a server, even a virtual one.
23:53  daemonkeeper: +d
23:55  proprietarysucks: sarthor: what is causing you to believe that this machine will route for you?
23:56  sarthor: proprietarysucks, please do not mind, i am not getting your question,
23:56  proprietarysucks: what makes you think you can use 192.168.1.253 as a gateway
23:56  proprietarysucks: I'm not saying you can't, I'm saying what is the evidence that you can?
23:57  proprietarysucks: you can't just randomly pick anything to use as your gateway. what causes you to feel this should work?
23:59  proprietarysucks: do you understand what I'm asking you
23:59  sarthor: because the 192.168.1.253 is a dsl router, connected to the internet, and other clients were connected to this modem, and they were using and browsing the internet, same as the other clients, the Linux server is also connted to that switch, so it shoud work too
23:59  proprietarysucks: ok
23:59  proprietarysucks: so the clients in your diagram are using this as their gateway?
