00:00  proprietarysucks: they are _right now_ using it as their gateway
00:00  proprietarysucks: confirm that
00:00  sarthor: some have gateway configured 192.168.1.254 and some have 253
00:00  proprietarysucks: can you confirm that one which is configured for 253 is working this second?

00:21  ovrflw0x: how can i get into a dsl modem which shows ISPs ip address as *Gateway* instead of 192.168.*.*???
00:22  ovrflw0x: is the modem locked bridged? if yes what can be done?
00:22  ovrflw0x: hey keisterstash are you networking expert? on routers?
00:24  sPOOkah: buy your own modem?
00:25  ka1ser: make your own modem?
00:25  ka1ser: =P
00:25  ovrflw0x: c'mon you can give a better  answer
00:27  proprietarysucks: I think your question is weird
00:27  proprietarysucks: what are you trying to do
00:28  sPOOkah: it is a wierd question.. why do you care how your provider connects you to their network?
00:28  ovrflw0x: proprietarysucks--> i have [[(fibrecable)->telephone wire-->DSL Modem (ZTE ZXDSL 831 II)-->router dir-600 dlink-->PC]]
00:29  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> i doubt the capability of that modem to provide me withi full speed bandwidth
00:29  ovrflw0x: i have 1mb speed line
00:30  ovrflw0x: proprietarysucks--> i have [[(fibrecable)->telephone wire-->DSL Modem (ZTE ZXDSL 831 II)-->router dir-600 dlink ((B1))-->PC]]
00:31  ovrflw0x: wat say sPOOkah the POOkah
00:32  proprietarysucks: I don't understand your layout sorry
00:32  ovrflw0x: wat part don't you get?
00:33  ovrflw0x: telephone ((like)) wire
00:33  Mekkis: ovrflw0x, how much of that do you have control over?
00:33  proprietarysucks: why you have fiber going to dsl modem I guess
00:33  proprietarysucks: I don't use that kind of stuff
00:33  ovrflw0x: Mekkis--> dunno
00:34  sPOOkah: ovrflw0x your wondering why your speeds are so slow?
00:34  kebomix: hello, anybody used "your freedom software " before ?
00:34  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> my speed is fine but wanna max the juice out of the bandwidth XD
00:34  sPOOkah: are you paying for a 1mb connection and you want to jail break the modem?
00:34  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> yep
00:36  sPOOkah: ovrflw0x freenode is strict about illegal activity so you should ask on another network
00:36  ka1ser: what does it have to do with gateway?
00:36  ka1ser: =s
00:37  ovrflw0x: lol wats illegal in it sPOOkah ? r u crazy?
00:37  ovrflw0x: i called isp and asked about what i wanna do
00:37  ka1ser: =o
00:37  ovrflw0x: they r too dumb to understand wat i wanna do
00:37  ovrflw0x: i get webpage login every day or after some hours which i want to avoid
00:37  sPOOkah: maybe you arent explaining it well because i must be misunderstanding you too
00:38  ka1ser: I am too
00:38  ovrflw0x: for that i want to change vpc/vpe values
00:38  doublehp: problem with nmap -n -v -sP" : as user it gives me all IPs (including aliases of each machine) but not MACs ; as root, it gives me MACs but not aliases ; how to get all IPs, AND all MACs ?
00:38  kebomix: i can't understand the idea of TCP-->HTTP tunneling
00:38  ka1ser: doublehp: run it as user and then as root =)
00:38  doublehp: no
00:38  doublehp: as root
00:39  ovrflw0x: oh its vpi/vci values
00:39  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> if i can "replace" the modem why can't i jailbreak this modem?
00:39  ka1ser: thats ATM
00:40  ovrflw0x: so can anyone tell me how can i "Access" the modem?
00:40  sPOOkah: usually you can web into it
00:40  ka1ser: ovrflwox you are not clear
00:40  ka1ser: on what you mean by access the modem
00:41  ka1ser: kebomix: what you dont understand?
00:41  sPOOkah: ovrflw0x do a traceroute and try hop 2 in your web browser
00:42  ka1ser: you wont be able to improve bandwidth... at any case if you wanna hack it... you are on the wrong direction
00:42  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> traceroute -h 2?
00:44  ka1ser: doesnt make sense at all
00:45  kebomix: ka1ser: i was using that software "your freedom" , i was providing it with proxy, and it connects it to one of their server with a low surfing speed (there is a premium but have to pay), i got my own server and i connect to it successfuly and i'm not using their servers anymore but still low surfing , i need anyother application that does same thing but i will provide it with my server
00:46  kebomix: yeah that is what i thought :D
00:49  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> you there man?
00:52  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> i get 10.9.*.* address
00:52  ovrflw0x: but it doesn't open
00:52  ovrflw0x: is it cause there is a router in between?
00:54  ovrflw0x: yo sPOOkah where are you man?
00:55  ka1ser: kebomix, just set an http proxy server on a computer outside the firewalled network... and configure that on the application that you want to use (e.g. firefox).
00:56  ka1ser: what do you mean by it doesn't open??
00:56  ka1ser: hmm
00:56  ovrflw0x: brb
00:58  doublehp: problem with nmap -n -v -sP" : as user it gives me all IPs (including aliases of each machine) but not MACs ; as root, it gives me MACs but not aliases ; how to get all IPs, AND all MACs ?
01:02  ovrflw0x: sPOOkah--> you there man?
01:03  ovrflw0x: i am now directly connected to the modem but still can't access the page of the modem
01:04  sPOOkah: port scan it
01:04  sPOOkah: if its not listening on any ports you are s.o.l
01:04  doublehp: is there a way to probe all MACs on the network ?
01:05  ovrflw0x: 10.9.243.180
01:05  ovrflw0x:  220.224.150.85

13:55  petter_: hi guys
13:57  petter_: im trying to find a good router that is suitable for gaming and need to be able to handle a good load without going down. In addition,one feature I need to have is be able to restrict internet access per single device. I.e. the device should be able to communicate with other devices in the same network but not be able to contact the internet.
13:57  petter_: Any recommendations?
13:57  rvsjoen: gaming does not generally constitute a good load
13:57  petter_: rvsjoen: gamig + torrent :)
13:57  rvsjoen: ;) had a feeling that was coming
13:58  petter_: i have a dlink 624+ and the wireless is constantly going down so i had to switch to wired :)
13:58  petter_: snakker du norsk?
13:58  rvsjoen: mhm
13:59  petter_: rvsjoen: the important thing is being able to restrict access to the internet
13:59  petter_: per device
14:00  mAniAk-_-: petter_: netgear wndr3700, dlink dir 655, linksys wrt320n
14:00  rvsjoen: that linksys one is pretty nice
14:00  petter_: thanks
14:00  petter_: let me have a look
14:02  petter_: so you would recommend the linksys one out of these three?
14:03  rvsjoen: I would, someone else might not :)
14:03  petter_: brb
14:03  rvsjoen: haven't tried the netgear, but i'd pick the linksys over the dlink
14:18  petter_: one more when having set the router to n and if your netcard support the n standard, will i be able to get 300mbits per sec or it is just made up figures :)
14:23  mAniAk-_-: petter_: link speed can be 300Mbit, but you wont get in actual data rates
14:25  petter_: maniak: yes i know that, to clarify my question, if i set it to n, but also have a laptop that support only b/g. will it still be able to connect or do i need to set it to b/g/n or similar
14:48  mAniAk-_-: petter_: most N routers has several mimo streams, if you connect one G client one of those streams will run att G speed
14:56  K350: how do I output tcpdump results in a file?
14:58  mAniAk-_-: >
14:58  mAniAk-_-: and a filename
15:04  rvsjoen: -w filename if you want the pcap dump
15:04  mAniAk-_-: or that

15:35  LzrdKing: if i changed a file that was synched to dropbox, then connect to that dropbox account with a different computer that has an older version of that file, does the new one get copied from dropbox, or does the old one get sent to it?
15:43 +xand: LzrdKing: I don't know, TIAS or ask them, but I imagine the newer version would override the old one.
15:43  LzrdKing: TIAS?
15:44 +xand: try it and see
15:46  danci1973: Hello...
15:47  danci1973: I'm using 'nuttcp' to measure network speed. ... However, in some cases the other side is not reachable and in such a case 'nuttcp' waits for a looong time...
15:47  danci1973: Is there a way to change this timeout 'from the outside' (ie. not chaning the code)?
15:47  cba123: I have a remote FTP/ssh machine.  When I copy files over FTP, I get 192+/- KBps, with scp I get 400+/- KBps.  Any ideas why that would be?  I can't reconfigure the server.  Basically I was wondering if there were things I could do to optimize the ftp transfer on my end to get the most I can out of it.  Port forwarding and things like that.
15:48  LzrdKing: xand: problem with TIAS is that if the older file wipes out the newer file, i lose information
15:48  danci1973: I'm talking about Linux 2.6 ...
15:48  LzrdKing: cba123: turn off ftp and use scp
15:48  LzrdKing: done
15:49 +xand: LzrdKing: because you couldn't possibly make a new file to test it.
15:49 +xand: or make a backup of the new file.
15:49  cba123: LzrdKing, I have a gui transfer program for FTP, which I prefer over manual scping.  I'm running Linux, and haven't found any scp gui's that work like the ftp ones.  Local on one side, remote on the other, drag and drop.
15:51 +xand: filezilla supports SFTP
15:51 +xand: which uses ssh the same way as scp
15:52  LzrdKing: cli > gui
15:54  cba123: LzrdKing, For some it is.  For some it isn't.  I prefer it in some cases, but not in others.  I have a simple rsync script setup to transfer everything back and forth, but it isn't easy to do just one file back and forth with long names.  Hence my preference for a gui.
15:54  LzrdKing: tab-complete
15:54  cba123: it isn't easy for me to do*
15:55  cba123: LzrdKing, Odd names, and tab complete is slow because said remote machine doesn't load fast.  More so when I haven't logged in yet, because tab-complete takes longer.
15:55  cba123: odd/similar names
15:55  LzrdKing: if winscp can do this, i'm sure there are other gui clients that can'
15:57  cba123: I've tried Dolphin's native transfer, doesn't work well just starts a transfer nothing more.  Same with OSX's native one.  Tried KFTP, tried JFTP, and GFTP.  Will try Filezilla, since I didn't find that one before.  Thanks for the help and suggestion xand and LzrdKing.
15:58  LzrdKing: maybe instead of *ftp, he should be looking for *scp
16:03  abstract3d: hi, if i want to have my own .com mail, the best and easiest solution to go is to buy a domain and use it with Google Apps for Your Domain?
16:06  LzrdKing: or a mail forward within your registrars settings
16:07  abstract3d: yes, but if i want to sends also mails with that mail address it will be showing as "on benhalf **"
16:08  LzrdKing: google apps ftw
16:08  LzrdKing: its easy to set up, 10 minutes
16:08  LzrdKing: unless your dns provider takes hours to update
16:09  abstract3d: what's your suggestion for .com registrar?
16:09  daemonkeeper: There is absolutely no sane reason to trust Google to take care of your emails.
16:09  LzrdKing: no reason not to
16:09  daemonkeeper: You mean besides privacy?
16:10  LzrdKing: email is neither private nor secure
16:11  daemonkeeper: You mean, just because your email is not secure I shall trust Google not to abuse its acquisitiveness?
16:11  LzrdKing: no, you shall do whatever you want
16:11  abstract3d: daemonkeeper: what's your suggestion?
16:11  abstract3d: buy domain & vps and host my mailing server?
16:11  daemonkeeper: Indeed. I prefer not to trust Google and not to write people having Gmail addresses.
16:12  LzrdKing: but for price and ease of use, there is is no reason not to go with google
16:12  daemonkeeper: Indeed.
16:12  daemonkeeper: To bait users ;)
16:12  LzrdKing: because yahoo or msn or aol, or verizon or at&T are any different
16:12  daemonkeeper: They give you service, you give them information about you.
16:13  abstract3d: ofcourse, they are not stupid to give you free mail with that services at 0 cost
16:13  daemonkeeper: They aren't indeed. Not as bad and powerful as Google though, which is able to glue a lot of information together to track you.
16:13  LzrdKing: oh no
16:13  daemonkeeper: abstract3d: If you feel capable to do so, absolutely.
16:13  LzrdKing: i'm being tracked!
16:13 * LzrdKing puts on his foil hat
16:13  LzrdKing: that'll keep them out
16:13  abstract3d: :$
16:14  abstract3d: whats your suggestion for .com registrars?
16:14  daemonkeeper: LzrdKing: You said it yourself. If you don't care about companies being fed about your interests and buying behavior, its nothing wrong to go to Google.
16:15  LzrdKing: i welcome it
16:15  daemonkeeper: If you don't care to tell Google who you know neither.
16:15  LzrdKing: targeted marketing ftw
16:17  daemonkeeper: abstract3d: The registrar of your choice may depend on your country and local suppliers.
16:19  LzrdKing: 1and1.com is super cheap and decent
16:19  abstract3d: daemonkeeper: well, i was thinking to buy not from my local registrars but others like namecheap godaddy etc
16:19  LzrdKing: for a registrar, not web hosting
16:19  abstract3d: LzrdKing: and its easy to change NS records etc, right?
16:20  daemonkeeper: NS not, all others yes.
16:20  LzrdKing: yes it is
16:20  daemonkeeper: NS records must be told to the upstream provider. Your registrar usually will take care of it
16:21  LzrdKing: ns records point to your DNS hosting provider; i use zoneedit
16:22  daemonkeeper: Not necessarily, I do use the registrar only to handle the domain registration and advertising crap to registries. I do use my own NS.
16:22  daemonkeeper: But for most use cases you are right, that's the way to go
16:26  abstract3d: LzrdKing: wow
16:26  abstract3d: 1and1 is awesome
16:27  abstract3d: LzrdKing: but do you have one more suggestion for any cheap and decent .eu registrar?
16:27  LzrdKing: daemonkeeper: you need to tell your registrar what ns servers to use
16:27  daemonkeeper: LzrdKing: Sure
16:27  LzrdKing: abstract3d: no idea, i never looked into buying any eu domains
16:29  abstract3d: LzrdKing: 1and1 is safe right?
16:29  airells: hi, 4 VLAN created on switch ( vlan on ports ) can these vlans has same addressing? i mean 192.168.0.XXX  and submask 255.255.255.0 ? Or each vlan has to has  different addressing ?
16:29  abstract3d: i mean i won't lost my domains suddenly :$
16:29  LzrdKing: abstract3d: not that i've ever head of
16:32  daemonkeeper: airells: Each VLAN can have the same subnet, the are divided on layer 2, thus this won't break anything. Please note that this is usually not what you want, if you want to route traffic in between VLANs.
16:38  airells: daemonkeeper i just want to have separated vlans, which can communicate only  through server ( domain controller ) so same addressing isnt a problem? im not sure if i understand it good
16:39  daemonkeeper: Having the same address in a different VLAN won't interfere with each other. That also implies though, that you aren't able to communicate between VLANs (i.e. from VLAN1 to VLAN2 and back).
16:39  daemonkeeper: The later because of routing issues.
16:45  abstract3d: what about domainsite.com (sister to name.com) ?
16:58  Kendall: Hi, I have a SAN device on my network with an unknown (private class) IP address.  I disconnected it, plugged it into an isolated switch, and tried nmapping the two private class IP ranges that we normally use, but nothing turned up.  Is there another method to determine the IP of the device?
17:03  dkr: Kendall: check dhcp server logs
17:04  OmNomSequitur: Kendall, does your SAN have VGA + keyboard output?
17:04  Kendall: OmNom:  no sir it doesn't.  iSCSI and ethernet management
17:05  Kendall: i'll see if I can get into the switch to check dhcp logs
17:05  mAniAk-_-: is there any dhcp on that segment
17:07  Kendall: oh wait i don't think that will work...there is DHCP, but the IP of the SAN is static AFAIK
17:09  mAniAk-_-: well if its static youre not gonna se snything in the logs
17:09  OmNomSequitur: Kendall, is this SAN newly installed?
17:09  OmNomSequitur: Kendall, you can check at switch level, duh.
17:09  OmNomSequitur: You just need to know which switch ports the SAN's patched into.
17:10  OmNomSequitur: You *do* label your ethernet cables right?
17:10  Kendall: no sir, it was installed in a previous environment, and it's being re-configured for the new environment
17:10  OmNomSequitur: Ah.
17:10  Kendall: yes I do :)
17:10  OmNomSequitur: It might ben on a different subnet, then.
17:10  OmNomSequitur: Do you know the IP addressing scheme of the old environment?
17:11  OmNomSequitur: If SANs are anything like Buzz Lightyear action figures, there'll be a red reset button around the back.
17:11  OmNomSequitur: And a Spanish toggle option.
17:11  Kendall: yes, 172.16.30.x is what i was told it was, though I connected the SAN and a computer to an isolated switch, ran nmap on that range and came up empty
17:11  Kendall: LOL
17:11  OmNomSequitur: "Hola, soy NetAppao!"
17:12  OmNomSequitur: Kendall, what's the subnet mask?
17:12  Kendall: 255.255.255.0
17:12  OmNomSequitur: Ah.
17:12  Whitor: You could set oyur subnet mask to all Zeros ... (putting oyurself on the same network as it ... then just snoop traffic...
17:12  OmNomSequitur: Ok, then, easiest way - configure a laptop's NIC to be in the same subnet, then connect with a Cat6 or Cat5 crossover cable.
17:12  OmNomSequitur: You can then access the SAN's web interface.
17:13  Whitor: How can you do that if you don't know the subnet ?
17:13  OmNomSequitur: Oh, he doesn't know the exact IP.
17:13  Whitor: Oh... you do ... sorry , missed that
17:13  OmNomSequitur: I suppose you could do a ping sweep of 172.16.30.0/24
17:13  OmNomSequitur: Easiest way? Phone the vendor.
17:14  OmNomSequitur: Or type "[SAN model] reset IP" into Google.
17:14  OmNomSequitur: But it's only 255 addresses!
17:14  Whitor: yeah... just match subnets and snop traffic ... if you didn't know the subnet you could just set yours to 0.0.0.0 and snoop that way... with it isolated from all other devices, you would only see its traffic and your own
17:15  Kendall: awesome.  I'm going to go give that a shot.  Thank you guys!
17:50  progzer: Excuse me, I'm seeing ICMP type 3 code 13 messages on my router (trying to debug a ike/ipsec connection).
17:50  progzer: I have a source and the destination (being my router's IP)
17:50  progzer: Looking up type 3 code 13, I see its a unreachable - administrative denial.
17:51  progzer: How do I find out WHAT destination was denied
17:51  progzer: I tried to convert the hex digits to decimal numbers to see if I got another IP address out of it, no such luck
17:53 +LT: the icmp error should contain the header of the packet that triggered the error
17:57  progzer: Also, my vpn connection is failing because I get a ICMP type=1 code=0  "Time exceeded"
17:58  progzer: Would anyone happen to know a little more about that? What could I do/need to make sure I don't exceed the time.
17:59  kristian-aalborg: hi all
18:00  MapMan: Hey, can someone help me out? How do I properly configure routing tables in this example: http://www2.rad.com/networks/2005/ipkit/main.htm (insert new long network)
18:03  psychoschlumpf: question: which brand of switches would you recommend?
18:03  progzer: hmm the header of the type 11 code 0 message matches expect for the second 8 bits
18:03  psychoschlumpf: (for backend switches)
18:06  progzer: LT: if the TX message started with "45 10 00 70 54 C7 00 00 10 11 DA 2D 75 F0 55 31" and the RX (ICMP type 11 code 0) has "45 00 00 70 54 C7 00 00 01 11 E9 3D"
18:06  progzer: in the "ip header+first 8 bytes of the original datagram's data" part
18:06  progzer: is that considered a match?
18:11 +LT: that's not the same is it? not only is the second byte different but also the last two in the RX is different
18:14  progzer: hmm
18:14  progzer: then my router sent some other packet which received that response
18:14  psychoschlumpf: which switch brand and type would you recommend for 3 edge switches to connect to one big backbone-switch?
18:14  MapMan: any help on my case?
18:21  ambro718: Hi. I'm implementing a DHCP client, but I'm having problems sending and receiving packets. I can send packets, but they have the wrong source IP (one of an existing interface, instead of 0.0.0.0). And my application doesn't get the replies sent by the DHCP server. Here are the relevant syscalls by strace http://pastebin.ca/index.php

18:25  kristian-aalborg: can someone gently guide me through mounting my samba share on a laptop on WAN
18:25  kristian-aalborg: I use Ubuntu 10.4
18:56  progzer: hmm type11 timeout message was for "45 00 00 70   u.U1........E..p
18:56  progzer: 61 CF 00 00 01 11 DC 35
18:57  progzer: the 01 is TTL and 11 is UDP
18:57  progzer: I know that the router should send a UDP packet to remote port 500
18:58  progzer: what's setting that TTL to 1 ms!?
19:08  AdvoWork: is there a way to test connection/speed between my server and my client pc?
19:12  mAniAk-_-: iperf
19:17  AdvoWork: mAniAk-_-, ive got that on both the server and the client pc
19:31  proprietarysucks: so run it
19:31  proprietarysucks: and choose your interface
19:32  woble: Adsl / Vdsl considering distance to the neighborhood-hub, should upstream degrade just as much (percentage wise) as downstream? ISP sends me 60/6, i get 27/5
19:33  ArtyG: woble: It should, but the modem might be able to compensate.
19:33  woble: Thats what i thought.. modem doenst compensate for sure
19:33  ArtyG: Wait, now that I think of it.
19:34  ArtyG: Since upstream and downstream are in different frequency bands, the downstream frequencies could be attenuated more.
19:35  ArtyG: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/ADSL_spectrum_Fritz_Box_Fon_WLAN.png A la this.
19:36  ArtyG: So if the low frequencies aren't attenuated as heavily as the higher ones, that would explain it, right?
19:36  woble: i can look that up :)
19:37  ArtyG: I forgot everything I learned in the past year for a minute, but I remembered it, hahah.
19:38  woble: i found the ISP admin settings
19:38  woble: base64 decoded on the "change password" page, normally I dont have admin entry to the modem
19:38  woble: Current 15 min Corrected Codewords:	9215 	4365   <-- thats what bugs me the most
19:42  xbackslashx: I am teaching myself about computer networks, and want to know more about routing and routing tables. any books one can recommend this?
19:54  daemonkeeper: Most introductions to enterprise routing include a comprehensive chapter or two about protocols and techniques.
19:54  daemonkeeper: Also every good network book introduces this briefly. Depending on your requirements this may be enough
20:06  xbackslashx: I have already ordered both Sybex's network foundations and tcp/ip foundations, hoping it would have the material I am looking for.
20:12  daemonkeeper: The standard work about networking is Tanenbaum's book.
20:14  daemonkeeper: About TCP/IP in depth Stevens knows everything.
20:14  ka1ser: yeah Tanenbaum's book for networking is a must
20:19  ka1ser: Cisco has good explanation on routing... but perhaps is not ideal for someone not enrolled on cisco program
20:19  daemonkeeper: Yes, I though about those books.
20:19  progzer: Could someone take a look at: http://inetpro.org/pastebin/94ca590c20b14c60985fd581ac0364c0
20:20  progzer: I try to initiate traffic (the telnet) to start up an ipsec tunnel
20:20  progzer: A UDP port 500 (isakmp) packet from my address to the remote peer is sent.
20:21  progzer: Immediately after this I notice a ICMP type 11 (time exceeded) arrives from an IP which is "close-ish" to the remote peer.
20:22  progzer: The original packet data (at the end of the ICMP) message doesn't entirely match the packet that was sent to the peer.
20:22  progzer: Though the identification bits (61 CF) match.
20:23  progzer: The ttl in my sent packet was 0x10 (16ms) the ttl in the strange ICMP response is 0x01 (1ms)
20:23  progzer: Any ideas, anyone?
20:25  ka1ser: ttl 16ms?
20:26  ka1ser: it should be 16hops, no 16ms

21:51  progzer: Got TTLs of 237 (is that 255-237 = 18 ?)
21:52  xingu: progzer: the existing dump you had similar to http://inetpro.org/pastebin/94ca590c20b14c60985fd581ac0364c0 is sufficient
21:52  xingu: probonono: if the field in the outgoing packets (the isakmp) is >18, it's sufficient
21:53  xingu: probonono: 14 45 10 00 70 61 CF 00 00 10 11 CD 25 75 F0 55 31   E..pa......%u.U1
21:53  ka1ser: so.. ping works but telnet doesnt?
21:53  progzer: That means, now I need to get the remote end (and perhaps my ISP?) to do something about this?
21:53  xingu: s/probonono/progzer/
21:53  progzer: ping works to the IP address which returns the ICMP message to me
21:53  xingu: progzer: the value ... 10 ... as in 10 11 CD ... - needs to change.
21:53  progzer: ping to the peer times out.
21:53 --- Channel ##networking was synced in 171 seconds
21:54  xingu: progzer: ping to the peer will be complicated by the existance of the crypto map
21:54  ka1ser: so ping to 96.2 with -t 255 fails?
21:54  ka1ser: oh
21:54  progzer: ping to 96.1 (1 less than the peer. The remote party asked me for a traceroute to this, but they're not at work anymore)
21:54  xingu: actually ike to 96.2 fails
21:55  xingu: but anyway.
21:55  progzer: works 3/4 (one was lost)
21:55  progzer: TTL 237
21:55  ka1ser: you mean to 99.1 right?
21:56  progzer: Both 99.1 and 96.1 give me a TTL 237
21:56  ka1ser: and both work?
21:56  ka1ser: nvm
21:57  progzer: 96.2 is the peer. 99.1 is the router (in my sampling) which responds with the icmp 11 when trying to set up ike with the peer.
21:57  ka1ser: yeah... but if you forget about vpn for a moment... ping to 96.2 with -t 255 works or not?
21:59  progzer: I'll remove the crypto map from my external interface and try. (With it it doesn't work)
21:59  ka1ser: I see
21:59 --- ChanServ sets modes [##networking +v Mxyzpltk]
22:00  progzer: Doesn't work without it either.
22:00  ka1ser: =s
22:00  ka1ser: same message?
22:00  progzer: Though I ran "nmap -sU -p U:500,4500 -PN 80.85.96.2" yesterday and got isakmp open
22:00  ka1ser: ICMP
22:01  progzer: Perhaps they're blocking pings?
22:01  ka1ser: if they are blocking pings... you should get a different ICMP message
22:01  ka1ser: or... none at all
22:01  progzer: Didn't get a response
22:01  ka1ser: probably just none at all
22:01  ka1ser: but no ICMP type 11, right?
22:01  progzer: No 11
22:02  ka1ser: yeah, then most probably they are blocking pings
22:02  ka1ser: try to reproduce, sending an udp message to 96.2
22:02  ka1ser: hmm probably tftp
22:02  ka1ser: well
22:03  ka1ser: you would need to make sure ttl is greater than 16 somehow
22:03  progzer: I'll just use nmap again and see the debug on the router. I'm logging 80.85.0.0
22:05  ka1ser: oh you can set ttl on nmap
22:05  ka1ser: so yeah you can use that to reproduce
22:05  ka1ser: just add --ttl 255
22:06  ka1ser: and check if you get ICMP type 11 from 99.1
22:07  ka1ser: probably you will get ICMP with some other message from 96.2 or something but that way you would be sure that 99.1 can actually forward packets to 96.2
22:07  ka1ser: =p
22:10  nigel00: hi guys,
22:10  nigel00: i have local admin access on a network computer
22:10  nigel00: is it possible
22:11  nigel00: to get on the network domain
22:11  nigel00: to somehow get domain administrator
22:11  nigel00: ??
22:12  nigel00: i want to be able to have unrestricted access on the network resources
22:12  nigel00: the enviroment im working with is windows xp pro sp3
22:13  sPOOkah: ask your domain admin to give you permissions
22:13  Borgoluzzuo: Does anyone know if it is possible to SSH into a DD-WRT router not from the local network?
22:14  nigel00: well spookah thats not an option at the moment
22:14  nigel00: but thanks anyway
22:15  progzer: nigel00, your login needs to be added to the local administrators group on the computer
22:15  nigel00: i see
22:15  nigel00: i did that
22:15  nigel00: i added the user to the administrators group
22:16  progzer: Then you should have 'administrator' access on that machine.
22:16  nigel00: yeh i have admin privlage on the machine
22:16  nigel00: however its the network
22:16  nigel00: access
22:16  nigel00: i require
22:17  progzer: which ever machine you want admin access to, you need to be part of the administrators group on that machine.
22:17  progzer: (this may be inherited as domain admin etc)
22:18  nigel00: i mean
22:18  Borgoluzzuo: Does anyone know if it is possible to SSH into a DD-WRT router not from the local network?
22:18  nigel00: when attempting to access resources
22:18  nigel00: its ask for username pass for the domain
22:18  nigel00: is it possible to recover or reset admin domain?
22:18  sPOOkah: you want domain admin rights without having them assigned
22:18  progzer: You need access to the domain controller for that
22:19  nigel00: i see
22:19  progzer: It asks for domain access if you try and access a network share on the domain
22:19  nigel00: thats right
22:19  progzer: local admin does not give you access to domain resources
22:19  sPOOkah: if you dont have access to a DC and you dont know the password you should scrap your domain and start over
22:19  progzer: you need a domain account for that. OR you need a local account on the network resource you're trying to open, that would work as well.
22:20  nigel00: hmm...
22:20  nigel00: i see
22:20  progzer: You can access a network resource as RemoteLocalMachineName\LocalRemoteUser  OR  Domain\DomainUser
22:21  progzer: depending on whom all have been given network access permissions
22:22  nigel00: i mean i was on the network and there are some vbscripts
22:22  nigel00: for netlogon
22:22  nigel00: are they useful?
22:23  progzer: Can't say, they're your scripts
22:23  nigel00: and what about sniffing?
22:24 +xand: sniffing glue is bad mmkay
22:24  nigel00: lol
22:25  sPOOkah: nigel00 if you are trying to sniff the admin password then you obviously didnt forget the password since someone would be logging in with it
22:25  sPOOkah: you are on the wrong network if you want help escalating your priveledges
22:26  nigel00: you must of misunderstood me spookah
22:26  sPOOkah: naw i dont think i did
22:26  ryanlin_: does anyone particpate in coresite's any2easy network?
22:27  ryanlin_: maintained by fic
22:27  nigel00: how useful is the erd commander?
22:28  progzer: I'm going to call it a night (its early morning now; plus I have to get my bike fixed up tomorrow morning as well, dropped the clutch to go into a brick wall!)
22:29  progzer: Thanks a lot for all your inputs, ka1ser, xingu
22:29  nigel00: yeah thanks progzer
22:30  ka1ser: np... good luck with that
